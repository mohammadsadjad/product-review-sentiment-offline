"Sentiment","Review"
"Positive","This is a great book: I must preface this by saying that I am not religious - but I loved this book. I really enjoyed the story it was telling. To me this is more a story about where we come from as women, rather than some religious/biblical treatise. Reading this book you can really feel a connection with the character Dinah and the writer brings to life her world with colorful vividness. This book has an almost feminist feeling and to my great amusement paints Jacob as a villainous man who personifies most of the worst qualities one can have. This story sucked me in and I read it practically in one sitting. It was one of the best books I have read in a while."
"Negative","Huge Disappointment.: As a big time, long term Trevanian fan, I was extremely disappointed in this ""experiment"" by the author. I deem this effort an experiment since it is so unlike anything ""Trev"" (as his fans call him) has ever written before. Plain flat-out boring! It's almost as if Jane Austen had attempted to write a Twilight Zone episode under the influence of Sominex."
"Positive","Wayne is tight but cant hang with Turk.: This album is hot as it wants to be. However Cash Moneys best album ever is Turks Young and Thuggin. So better luck next time Wayne"
"Positive","Excellent: I read this book when I was in elementary school- probably fourth grade. I read a lot of books, but this one stuck with me and I still consider it to be one of my favorites. I just recently remembered the title (after seeing crows out my window) and may have to buy myself a copy."
"Negative","Not about Anusara: Although this book is touted on several Anusara web sites as a book about Anusara, I found it to be more about self-loathing and a poor body image. From cover to cover, the author rehashed her, and other's, disfunctions and poor self-esteem related to a poor body image and eating disorders.Now, if you fall into any of the afore mentioned catagories, you may find this book for you. If not, it's a waste of time. (I too have looked in the mirror during a yoga session and thought, jeez, I'm going to have to not eat for the next month...., but I didn't dwell on it. And I don't consider a new pedicure when gazing at my feet in down dog.)My truly, heart felt advice to those of you whom this book will speak to is, spend less time on the mat and more in meditation, until you get your mind under control. I am saddened for anyone who is their own worst enemy. Life is too short.Yoga, and all it's attendant traditions, are so much more. Let it be so for you."
"Negative","Worst DVD Ever purchased: This was the very worst DVD that I have ever purchased. The technical quality was so bad that Fisher's features were unrecognizable. Musical tone production was simply atrocious. I could go on and on but really do not feel like wasting any more time on this piece of crap. Why does Amazon even put something this bad on the market for sale? I would really, really like my $$$ back, Amazon. Your faithful customers deserve far, far better from you. The back of the DVD cover says it all: ""THIS DVD IS NOT ENDORSED BY EDDIE FISHER."" Only five copies left?? If you have any mercy on your customers and you care about preserving your reputation as a reputable dealer of halfway marketable products, you will withdraw them immediately. To sell something this horrible is, in my opinion, disreputable and a disgrace to your reputation."
"Positive","Not the strongest fan, but gets the job done.: I wasn't sure if I should upgrade and spend $80 on a nice window fan, so I decided to risk it and go for something a little more low budget. This isn't the strongest fan in the world, but it does suck enough air in from outside to cool my bedroom down. Not super noisy or difficult to use. For the price, I'm pretty happy with my purchase."
"Negative","Bottom of the casebook barrel: At the beginning of this, my first year of law school, I didn't think too much about my actual casebooks. After a couple months, I began to think more about their layout, the organization, case notes, questions, indexes, etc. I began to have favorites, and some that I was less fond of. But until I saw this casebook, I didn't realize casebooks could be so awful. This casebook is badly in need or further organization, better headings, a better table of contents, better editing - in short, all of the details that make or break a casebook.Just to be clear, I am reviewing the second edition, published in 2009. I have also seen the first edition, and the best I can say is that this is, in fact, a significant improvement over the first attempt. But it has a long way to go before any 1L is going to be happy with it."
"Positive","Hilarious!: This movie is very sweet, I love it. And it's so funny, omigod! My favorite part is when Joy finds her mother feeding her *pet* chicken, and she goes, ""Ma! Ya fed the chicken chicken?"""
"Negative","The swinging, sadly, occurs only in the title.: Sad to say, Jason and his sidemen do not swing on this disk, and one might deduce from its quality that they don't swing anywhere else, either. Their stated ethic is admirable. But the good words don't stand in for good playing, and there is precious little of that on this album. The pianist plays passably, however."
"Positive","Planets: My son loves it! A hint of hanging this product, tie the line to the thumbnails first, than put them up."
"Negative","WARNING: Made in China!: I was just about to give these to my dogs and realized that they are made in China. Unfortunately I realized too late and cannot return them. In the trash they go. They could be a good product, but I'm not going to take a chance. I've heard too many scary stories about treats and food from China. My pets are not worth taking that risk with."
"Negative","Didnt even work: My little guy was highly dissapointed, the game did not even work. He had even spent his allowance on it :("
"Negative","Weak on content depth & breadth, editing, cookbook approach: This was a very disappointing book.Examples are simplistic and not well thought out. There are very basic shells for doing some parsing tasks a lot of different ways, but very shallow or missing rationale for the different alternatives. It felt like the author came up with a bunch of solutions without understanding the problems XML can address. Having E-Commerce in the title is a joke that hangs on one of the recurring examples throughout the book.Numerous gramatical and content errors. The structure of the book is light as well - examples before concepts and lots of white space & big type."
"Negative","Just another guy who gave it 1 star to bring down the rating: If you truly wish to learn what the media elite is and what is factual news, watch FOX News Channel for Bias News and CNN for semi unbiased news, and C-SPAN for fair news."
"Negative","NOT for preschoolers and up: This chair claims to be for ages 3 to 8, but my 5-year-old barely fits on it. I bought it to go with his kid sized desk, but this chair is so little that he has to reach up for the keyboard. The chair is probably fine for 3 to 4-year-olds, but that is about it. It does go together easily and is lightweight, so it does make a nice chair for the right sized child. The price is right, but unfortunately, that means I'm stuck with a pint sized chair because it is not worth the expense of return shipping. Very disappointed. I would not have ordered it had the description been accurate!"
"Positive","Brilliant!!!!: Quick shipping! I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this ring in person. It catches the sunlight and sparkles like crazy! You won't be disappointed if you order this."
"Negative","not silent by any means: I got today the HSF and replaced the original HSF with the SILET BOOST RX. Don't be fooled. It is not silet by any means. I would say it is even louder than the original stock fan. I own AMD 2000 Athlon XP, and it did not silence my box. Also The temperatures are still in mid 40's on idle.I would say it is a waste of money. Get Zelman or something else. Not this one."
"Positive","Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files - The Complete Third Season: Perfect for a fan of the show who loves it being uncensored and not having to worry about missing an episode because you have the entire season at your finger tips!"
"Negative","Stunningly bad: To be honest, I was stunned by this album. The singing is just unspeakably bad! Had I known beforehand that the performance on this album is so poor, I wouldn't have bought this album even if it had cost a quarter of its price.It's indecent for any artist or recording company to sell an album at full price when the quality of it is so low."
"Negative","would be a great product, but...: I got this frame as a Mother's Day present for my mom. I loaded up an SD card and installed it for her. It's very easy to set up and use. But I was very disappointed to discover that even though it is a wide-screen viewer (modes for aspect ratio of 4:3 and 16:9), the 16:9 mode is COMPLETELY USELESS!! It STRETCHES regular images to make them fit the screen. What kind of idiot thought of that??? I have a bunch of panoramic pics from our family reunion I wanted to be able to display in the full wide-screen mode, but since they're only displayable in 4:3 mode, they shrink down to fit within the smaller dimensions which makes it hard to see the detail.If not for that one major problem, this would have been a great gift for Mom."
"Negative","Unfortunately: I'm a fan of the Dark series Ms. Feehan has written. Unfortunately, I'm just going to be blunt and say that this book bored me. It's almost as if she was bored herself writing this book. I got it sometime last year, got through half of it and haven't finished it yet, and I've never done that with a book in my entire life. This is something I would not suggest for anyone to buy."
"Negative","A failure: This is the first book by Billy Collins that I have read, and so I must admit that my opinion may be relatively uninformed, although I think it is safe enough to assume that this is a fair representation of his work thus far. It seems to me that Collins' preoccupation with accessibility has overpowered his poetry, if indeed the contents of this book can be said to be poems at all, rather than cut-up prose. Dullness is the recurring characteristic of the collection, and the famous Collins charm wears thin very quickly. The value of poetry lies in how something is said, rather than what is said, and Sailing Alone Around the Room does not provide that value."
"Positive","Dark Hunter: It was a great read. Sexy, fun and a little out there. If you like mythology it's a must read."
"Negative","Execrable Editing: This already short book should be about 50 pages shorter yet. It is laced with repeated quotes, phrases, and facts. The first time you read that Churchill carried a lance in one of history's last cavalry charges, it's fascinating. The second time, it's a surprise to see the statement repeated almost verbatim. The third time, it's an insult.Again and again (and again), this pattern is repeated. On one page, the same clause from a Churchill quote appears three times. Enough already. It's bad enough that the writer made this mistake, but it's unforgivable for the editor to let it pass for publication in this shape. By paring 50 pages off the manuscript, it would be just what it claims to be -- not a bad short rehash of the existing Churchill biographies.Save your money. Get another Churchill biography."
"Negative","file corruptions frequently: I'm using this with a 400gb Western Digital harddrive on Windows XP system. First, I had hard time formatting and partitioning the drive with this case using native Windows XP tools. I finally used some commercial software. I transferred a lot of files into the harddrive via this case but there are too many file corruptions. I almost lost my important data, fortunately I had backup in DVD. Between the famous and reliable harddrive and this made-in-china case, naturally I think it's this drive that responsible for the file corruptions."
"Negative","Not a strong fantasy novel...: This book showed some promise in the beggining. It didn't come true.Arien Mirida thinks he's cursed. His bride was killed by beasts gathered by an ancient curse he didn't know about at the time (and later his aunt managed to tell him about). So Arien decided he'll live unhappily ever after - until he discovers hope exists.Enter Cat Sabledrake. She falls inlove with Arien and helps him destroy the curse. Then she helps him resurrect his bride, and they part, unhappy again.So what's the catch?!I liked this book until I realized it was setting the course for a whole series, with Cat Sabledrake as main character. Well, I for one, won't read the rest of them. The one I liked, Arien, won't be re-appearing, so why follow all Cat's bad choices of lovers?! If it's true love, let it be free... at least in a fantasy novel, love should be true.Not in this one, though. Not to the end."
"Positive","A cultural gem as well as a language book: The really standout feature of this book for me is how easy and fun it is to read. I consider myself fairly capable and passably fluent in conversational Spanish, but not only did I learn completely new and unexpected phrases and colloquial vocabulary in Spanish that had previously been beyond me, but Pepa and Pili (the main characters in the dialogues) had me chuckling and at times guffawing throughout. The author has a great sense of humor and a flair for refreshingly real-sounding conversation - not the stilted repartee you usually see in language books.After reading this book you will no longer need to sneak peaks at the subtitles during Almodovar movies. This book is great fun to read and the exercises are quite challenging - a real help in moving your Spanish past the text book into the real world."
"Positive","Lens was made in Taiwan.: Lens came packed nicely and promptly. But it was made in Taiwan and not Japan.Yet to use the lens. Will update when I do use it. This my first SLR lens."
"Positive","Incredible!: This book is very scary and very creepy..especially to me, someone who has paid lip service to Christ all his life but never really started to pay attention until a few months ago... for me it is a direct indication of where I could've fallen all too easily had I not made some good decisions... Highly recommended!!!"
"Positive","A GREAT WAY TO LIVE!!!: The Secret, is a great documentary. If one is open to change and betterment of one's self, then this doc is for you."
"Positive","Touching story of faith and determination: I chose to read this book before seeing the movie. I'm glad I did. It was a great story of survival. I would recommend this book to just about anyone."
"Negative","Dont buy: Dont buy this book! I purchased this book liking some of the recipes but I soon realized what a mistake it was. Not only dose the book barely go into detail about what you'll need for each recipe but most of the recipes in the book you can make yourself. You dont need a recipe to tell you how to make nachos."
"Negative","painfully shallow and annoying: I stopped reading this book way before the end because I could no longer stand the pretentious and self obsessed author. The book is less plotand more of the author's ode to self. I wasted my money on this book. It is so boring. Unless you care about how smart the author thinks she is, what books she has read, how attractive she thinks she is, ect. then don't buy this book. I am disgusted by her arrogance. I am shocked anyone could possibly find her attractive or interesting at all, much less as much as she herself does. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
"Negative","Starrett 734: It would be nice if I would have actually received a Starrett 734 mic as the description states. Instead I received a Starrett 3734 which is a cheaper copy of what I was supposed to get. I am very unhappy with the product I received."
"Positive","Very cool and great to get kids interested in physics: Works like it says. We were able to keep the top up for about 4 hours until we had to take it down. Living in a small apartment has it's drawbacks. Great for an office and still mind boggling when ""observing"" the unseen forces at a later date. Don't get frustrated and be persistent until you get the perfect balance. It's well worth it!!"
"Positive","Superb Figure: This is an excellent sculpt of Thor in one of his armored periods, the joints are good, with none of them being loose out of the package. The figure makes an excellent addition to my Marel collection."
"Positive","second time's the charm: The first week after i got it it worked wonders. Then the person you were talking to couldn't here you. I called the tech support line and they triend to figure out what was wrong, they couldn't. So i sent it back to Plantronics(because the telephone comes w/ a 2 year waranty) and they sent me a new one no questins asked. I was really surprized w/ their cooperation. The second one has working for about a month now."
"Positive","The Miracle of Life: I love this National Geographic special! I have cable so I got to see it for free and I watched it over and over. Before watching this I wasn't sure when I was ever going to be ready to be a mommy. Now, I look forward to sharing this miracle with my husband :)Anyways, I digress, the film is great. It's amazing how they have these images that look like it's from within the womb. In fact, sometimes it really is, at least the special on multiple births is."
"Negative","Has technical merit but characters are awful: Carl Sagan has done a good job of popularizing a sciences such as astronomy and physics and making them accessible to non-scientists like myself. The plot in the book is sort of cool but it just seem overly simplistic.Also, the characters were AWFUL. Just devices to carry the plot. I found myself not caring about a single one of them. Some of them were downright ridiculous. I'm glad that generally, Sagan stuck to non-ficton.There's better stuff out there."
"Positive","The Only Book You Need To Read: If there is one book that you need to read, this is it. It doesn't matter if you are a true spiritual seeker, just starting on your spiritual path or just curious, Petals of Grace is for you. Sai Maa's shakti(energy) is in every word, and you can't help but breathe it in. You can experience and know the joy, peace and truth of who you really are from reading this book."
"Negative","Edgar Winner???: I am always looking for new authors and was drawn to this book because of its status as an Edgar Winner. As I was yawning into page 250, I was wondering exactly when this book was ever going to be interesting, or, in fact, if there was a plot. This book was a waste of time and money. What in the world were the Edgar Award people thinking."
"Positive","my favorite: I first saw this movie a long time ago and it was not soon forgoten. I couldn't find it anywhere, or remember the title until i saw it on TNT (an old movie network) where i taped it and watch it often. It is one of my favorite movies of all times...it totally deserves 5 stars!"
"Positive","Lightsaber Action!: This game is absolutly the best game I have ever seen! there is a little bit of violence, but most of the time you kill droids, not humans. My favorite weopon is the lightsaber, because you can deflect laser blasts."
"Negative","Do not recommend included parts with purchase: Its not that I do not like the kit. I am furious at Amazon for recommending I buy this when it comes with the Jetboil Sol Ti. Turns out it comes with any Jetboil Flash or above. I absolutely love my Jetboil, best small camp stove I have ever had, and in fact I use it at home to boil water for tea since it is so fast. My advice is to order you Jetboil and wait on any accessory purchases to make sure that you need them."
"Positive","THIS DVD HAS ORIGINAL AND SEQUEL ON IT- 3 HOURS!: I recently purchased the DVD ""Betty Broderick: A Woman Scorned"", as I have enjoyed this well acted movie on the Lifetime Channel.To my surprise, this DVD has two movies on it. The first movie of the Betty Broderick story ""A Woman Scorned"" and the Sequel called ""Her Final Fury"". A total of 3 hours on this DVD! I also noticed that there is a special section on the DVD where you can see the real Betty Broderick and watch some of her actual testimony at the murder trial. Very interesting. I recommend this DVD highly. This is for anyone who enjoys movies bases on real life incidents, crimes and murders."
"Positive","Doug Moo moo moved me: Bought this as a resource for our Bible Studies look at James. Already had Moyter's commentary, this one has a less devotional, more technical feel. Accessible, deep, a def resource for our study."
"Negative","awful: the material was awful, felt like plastic and my son hated them, couldn't return these jeans fast enough and replace them with a better pair"
"Negative","Loosing Greating Message all the time: Regardless of replacing the 9V Battery almost once a week, this machinekeeps loosing the Greeting Message all the time.Voice Quality is also not very good."
"Negative","Total waste of money: This is junk! I can't believe I wasted my money. The adhesive gums up and doesn't even stick to your pics or scrapbook material."
"Negative","Not such a great book about great individuals: I found Hirsh's writing style choppy and at times the transitions between chapters and topics were confusing. Overall None Braver was a poor presentation of material that could have been informative and entertaining--which it was only slightly of both. I recommend you read something else on PJs. They deserve better."
"Positive","Peggy Cappy is the Best!: Peggy Cappy is a wonderful yoga instructor, especially for people over 50. Her videos show gentle yoga that anyone can do without fear of hurting themselves if they follow her instructions. I am so pleased to have ""found"" her."
"Negative","Who sets the prices on this stuff???: I bought this on paperback a little while back, and thought it was a good read. Since I plan to get my sister a Kindle for her birthday, I thought I'd gift this with it. Then I noticed something: THE KINDLE VERSION IS ALMOST TWICE AS EXPENSIVE AS THE PAPERBACK VERSION!!!The cost of a printed book includes the price of making the paper, printing, binding, packaging for retail distribution, and in Amazon's case, packaging and shipping to the customer. The cost of an eBook includes NONE OF THIS, and the cost of hosting and bandwidth for distribution of each eBook, especially when divided into the massive number sold by Amazon, is nothing compared to the printing costs mentioned above. Right now, I do NOT plan to purchase this along with my sister's Kindle. In fact, as this seems to be a growing trend on Amazon, I may decide not to get her a Kindle at all."
"Positive","Excellant: A very good laptop webcam. It works really well and has never stalled or frozen on me. It also records and takes pictures. Its cost effective here and perfect for a laptop for a new user."
"Positive","quilts of gee's bend: awesome book.... incredible story .....if u are into quilts this is an unbelievable book..... some one gave me a pattern and fabric adapted, from one of the quilts in this book.... i just loved this book......"
"Negative","Not what I wanted: I guess I didn't read close enough or something because I expect the solid ringed droppings but these are on a roll and have to be stretched over the mouth of the bottle. I used them because I would throw them away and they couldn't be returned since the box arrived very damaged(purchased with many other things and amazon didn't pack well) but I would never ever buy these again they were a huge pain."
"Positive","THIS CD IS THE BEST!!: THIS CD IS TOO GOOD FOR WORDS. ITS AWESOME SKA/PUNK, AND I THINK LTJ IS THE BEST BAND EVER. IT HAS AWESOME SONGS LIKE JOHNNY QUEST THINKS WE'RE SELLOUTS, HAPPYMAN, AND AUTOMATIC. IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY A SKA CD, MAKE IT LESS THAN JAKE. AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY A LTJ CD, MAKE IT LOSING STREAK."
"Negative","A kindle book you can't read on a kindle?: So, a kindle book you can't read on a kindle. I just don't understand..It makes no sense that you can only read this on the kindle app for the Mac or Pc. Somebody please explain."
"Negative","Premature Failure Poor Customer Support: I purchased the Soleus and it quit drawing water from the air in the first 6 mos. The Soleus service rep chuckled as she advised me to just buy a new one since shipping and minimum service charges would be substantial [...] bucks plus when you throw in the parts - like how else can you fix it - without parts? I since bought a Frigidaire with a five year warranty on the sealed system and it works fine - albeit a bit noisy vs Soleus. I hauled the Soleus to the dump and promptly threw it in the junk appliance area where it belongs."
"Positive","Extras that make a difference: I purchased an easel for my granddaughter for Christmas. I also purchased pads of easel paper and the deluxe companion easel set from Melissa & Doug. The purchases arrived in speedy time and were overpackaged so there was no need to worry about anything breaking. The paper and art supplies arrived just as advertised. I am so happy that I bought the companion set. My granddaughter was able to use her easel immediately rather than running to the store for crayons & paint & brushes. There's much less mess because each paint brush has a cup with matching color lid. My daughter-in-law says it was an excellent purchase!"
"Negative","This bag is a fake!: Please research the brand and know what to look for when you buy designer bags. This one pictured is a fake. Louis Vuitton did not make this bag and does not hang any tags from the bag like this. The speedy does not have any pockets on the side either."
"Negative","didnt work: received this item yesterday - trust me it is a quality items i was expecting a junky piece of plastic but it is just as you would remember from back in the day. i was very happy to get it but it did not work properly. people couldn't hear me so i am trying to exchange it today - i hope im not dissapointed in its replacement. i will let you all know when i get the new one. 4/20/11 Well im back - i received my replacement phone and unfortunately, it does not work. This one seems as im talking in a tunnel and the people i call say i sound like im far away. it is a shame, i love the phone. i will have to find another brand / provider to get what i need."
"Negative","Disappointment: This book was such a disappointment. It was too short, the plot was incredibly transparent, and the romance was clumsy. And at the end, frankly, I think Tony Hillerman just lost a large portion of his female fans."
"Positive","Life is just an edless waltz: Endless waltz is an awsome movie. the special edition DVD includes the OVA episiodes of the movie, it also includes a mobel suit encyclopedia and is veiwable in mutiple languages. It has the same voices as in the show(english version anyways). If you saw this on the cartoon network or YTV(people in canada), then you might have thought that it was very heavly edited, the truth is that it wasn't. sure commercials but thats about it. BUT, if you only saw it once, than you probobly didn't catch it all at once. Its a great DVD packed with loads of stuff that will make this a great movie from begining to end."
"Negative","The product review is a lie: There is NO adjustable shoulder strap. The unit itself is ok but not great. It's compact and stylish which is nice. The pocket for the extra battery has no padding or anything to hold the battery in so if it gets tipped at all while it's open the battery falls out easily. There is an opening for a belt loop but I'm sorry - who wears a camera case on a belt loop? I bought it to have the shoulder strap which is nonexistent. It's nice to have an extra battery but you could do better than this carrying case."
"Negative","what the ?: lost us right from the beginning, a lot of noise and camera action but didn't hold a candle to previous ""bourne"" movies"
"Positive","Leave It To Beaver First Season DVD's: My mom loves Leave It To Beaver. She is so glad she can watch the dvds."
"Positive","Lovely: One of the first things you notice about this CD is that the violinist is not close miked. Instead, the excellent sound engineering places him in the orchestral context, while everything he does remains full toned and clear sounding. The performance of the first concerto might put you in mind of the Berg Concerto. It is full of yearning and late Romanticism, although these feelings are never overdone. The second concerto is served by a performance that brings out all the majesty of the work. I'm still very fond of Henryk Szeryng's recording and, on Hungaroton, Denes Kovacs's. Nevertheless, this CD documents an important Hungarian artist, Gyorgy Pauk, in essential works of his great countryman, and thus has important documentary value in addition to the musical pleasure it gives."
"Positive","Amazing!: Jeff Buckley's ""Live A L'Olympia"" is a work of art! You can just feel the happy atmosphere in the concert, and it's like you're actually there. Jeff's Zeppelin parody is hilarious, and every song will have you either laughing or crying!I have total respect for Mary Guibert, and for even allowing us to have this capsule of time of Jeff is too nice of her. ""Live A L'Olympia"" is one of my all-time favourite CD's, and you will love it too!!"
"Positive","Nice product, but pricy.: I meant to order the Styling CREAM, but ordered the LOTION in error. (""Lotion"" is more descriptive of the ""Cream"") This product is a watery styler (thus my misunderstanding). Thought I'd try it, as shipping changes the dynamics of an exchange. It does a nice job, is light-weight, but you have to use more product. The result is nice body and natural shine. (With the Cream, you use less, but there is a heavier, dry, dullness.) As both products are pricy for what they are, I will probably save this Lotion for special occasions, as I do the Cream."
"Negative","Not a great source for code: The author uses ""pseudo-code"" through out the book. The cd contains only a pc-executable program. There is no source code on the CD.This book is a poor source of programming code where the author explains how ai works based on the pseudo-code.If you're looking for source code (ie C++ source code) you'll not find it here."
"Positive","Works fine, but a little wobbly: It does not fit all legs well and stacks of two make a wobbly support. However, for ""normal"" use the bed does not fall over. Even the kids have not caused the bed to tumble over. It seems the design could be better, but it works."
"Negative","canera case: Great sturdy case for my sony camera!! Love the color and also matches my pink camera but good for my silver camera as well."
"Positive","Great gift - Great story: You can't go wrong with Nelson DeMille. Charm School was an excellent read, and this audio book is a perfect addition to any fan's library. I would also highly suggest the John Corey series...Lion's Game, and the new Wildfire!"
"Negative","Markers Too Light: These markers are way too light. They show up on dry erase boards bright fluorescent yellow like hi-lighters instead of anything that you can use efficiently for any projects. If you need to create a presentation where the people viewing the information are more than 3 or 4 ft away or at an angle, they cannot see anything. I do not suggest you purchase these markers unless you plan to use them strictly for coloring."
"Positive","MV50 Superflow Pump: I have tried several low priced compressors for use as inflating the tires on my Ford F350. Most of them either take forever or simply cannot handle the pressure. I have even burned several of them out. The MV50, however, is strong and fast and easily up to the task. There are only two drawbacks: The unconventional tire inflator fitting on the end of the hose can be difficult to use depending on wheel configuration. I would have preferred a more traditional fitting, especially with a reverse ""truck chuck"" on it. The only other problem is the cord is too short. This unit must be attached to your vehicle's battery and the cord will not permit inflation of the rear tires on my F350 crew cab with the 8 foot bed. that being said, its easy enough to just hook up jumper cables to bridge that gap, plus most vehicles are not as long as mine anyway. All in all, this is a great product at a good price."
"Negative","Science Fiction for the beginner: Someone suggested that if I like SF I should read this book. They were mistaken. If you like SF, stay away from this book. Imagine if Tom Clancy wrote a romance novel, or if Stephen King wrote a children's book...get the picture?The plot was typical of SF movies of the 1950s and 70s: Super advanced plant people crash on Earth and a super secret group of world-dominating CEOs try to kill all the witnesses. The aliens want us to clean up our act, the conspiracy group wants to drill for oil in the protected Alaskan wilderness...hey, wait a minute...There is an important lesson given by Mr. Sheldon in this book: Sidney doesn't write good science fiction."
"Positive","Classic: This album is filled with Classic Texas songs. From Rita Ballou, to LA Freeway, to Like a Coat From the Cold, you will not want to stop listening to this CD and will find yourself singing along every chance you get. Sung in a voice that is uniquely Guy Clark, his throaty version of each song makes it his own. A must for any fan of Texas Country or Guy Clark."
"Negative","should be a whitepaper on Oracle's web site: There is very little of value in this book that shouldn't be posted on Oracle's web site as a tutorial or whitepaper. It is expectedly Oracle centric, but only covers their products in a very broad manner without much meat. For example, Chapter 4: ""Developing for an Oracle Application"" is only 16 pages and simply provides definitions for the variety of Oracle-side web apps/extensions.If you really want to buy an Oracle XML book, then get the O'Reilly ""Oracle XML Applications"". Now there's a 5* book."
"Negative","Problems with region: I'm from Brazil and the DVD does not run in our DVDs players, due region limitations.It would be interesting that, when Amazon detects a international sell, a warning should be displayed, telling the customers that they might have problems due to region definitions. A link to an article explaining region definitions/limitations/how to convert/alternatives would be very usefull too.At the moment I'm watching the episodes at my computer. This is not confortable."
"Positive","Like it: I've been using the kettle for about 2 months. What I like is that it is attractive, has an automatic shut-off switch, heats the water quickly, is cordless and does not take up too much counter space in my small kitchen. What I don't like is that the measuring window is difficult to see because it is hidden behind the handle and it is very, in my opinion, loud while heating the water. The noise bothers me the most. The pros outway the cons therefore, go for it. :-)"
"Negative","Run away!: This movie is almost has bad as Manos: THe Hands of FateAhh! Run away before you lose precious minutes of your life!"
"Positive","Fresh water chemical kit.: I like my fish and I like keeping this healthy. The master water test kit is nice. In the stores they want $50.00 or more to purchase this item. I lost 14 of my tropical because I didn't realize how sensitive they are to water conditions. So I checked Amazon.com to see if I could find a decent water testing kit that didn't cost $50 to $80. Amazon had my kit and the best price around.This kit allows you to test for Ph balance, ammonia and Nitrites in your aquarium water. Step by step guide instructions manual with a color chart and its accurate. I saved allot of money on this item. The savings alone bought my tropical fish food and my Tetra-Minfish food. Still costing less than $30.00. Great Buy and delivered on time."
"Positive","THE Best Horror Movie Ever!: This movie was the best. It had a original screne plot to it. Not to much blood though, oh well some movies are better without it. Joshua Jackson, and Jared Leto are hot in this movie!"
"Negative","this one goes back: instructions make no sense I.E. connect red wire to gear shift lever. I am not drilling holes in my rear bumper for something so questionable."
"Positive","Wide Open Ending: The mini-series/movie was really good. I thought that it was a typo when I saw how long it is. It is that long, though. Being that long, it tends to drag a bit, but overall, it was a wonderful story. The only thing that I didn't like about it was that the ending was left wide open and there is no sequel in site. This is supposedly based off of a book, but I had a heck of a time finding it online, let alone buying one."
"Positive","An Alltime Favorite forever: This is one of my favorite albums of all time. Its soo smooth, and Flows seamlessly. WIth Nicolays best work behind the boards and Phonte piloting. Beautiful music. Nuff said."
"Positive","Matlock - THe Second Season: My husband and I enjoy watching Matlock together---which is a good thing since he doesn't like anything but information type programming usually!"
"Positive","good product: this is a replacement pump and it works great, and the price was a lot better than any of the stores in my area."
"Negative","Bad design - drives me crazy: Push buttons on the rim are exposed and active even when the cover is closed. They cannot be disabled. These buttons control ring profiles so that the phone will change to silent without warning."
"Positive","We're addicted to 24: We started watching the broadcast episodes of 24 in season 5. We bought this title bundled with season 2 so that we could catch up. We became addicted. It's a real pleasure to watch this well-made action series without the commercials."
"Negative","French?: I took French in High School but I can't read this. And I didn't know it was in Frnch. The title seemed like the logical next step in his life. no where did it say it was in french and not English. Big dissapointment."
"Negative","Who the hell does she think she is??????: Trashy clothes and trashy music. Yes, they do go together. And I find her voice simply annoying!!! Christina, Christina, Christina--You are NOT Whitney Houston, nor will you ever sing like her. You have the worst singing voice---EVER!!!!Please dye your hair back to its original blonde color! I can't stand it being black! Put on more decent clothes than a stupid nightgown you bought at Victoria's Secret!!!!And for God's Sake, please take out that damn nose ring!!!! You are NOT Janet Jackson!!!!Don't waste your money on this crap!!!! AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!!!!! SOMEBODY MAKE HER STOP!!!!!Bottom Line: Christina may be beautiful and a great singer no matter what they say, but my words CAN bring her down!!!!"
"Negative","Dissapointed: Problem with this mouse is that very often it doesn't work properly. The mouse doesn't work if it is more than a couple of inches away from the computer and sometimes it doesn't work at all. Very disappointed.I'm returning it and buying something better than this poorly made mouse."
"Positive","A since of home...: For me this story is two side because I work with the Navajo and I am an adopted child myself. I did not learn until I was grown that when my birth mother ""placed"" me for adoption, she had been told to either give me up or they would forcefully take me...and I'm white! I contect very deep with Becks and feel in many ways her store is much my own story. I say it is a must watch...especially if you are adopted."
"Negative","Not the same as Anne 1 & 2.: This was a major disappointment. I loved the first and second of the Anne series, but this one does not have the same feel or charm that made Anne 1 and 2 so loved. Its like its not Kevin Sullivan making this. Its far to artsy and revolves around the war rather than the characters and green gables. They hardly even show green gables and it even gets burned down. (How could they do that!). I wish I'd never watched this, as its ruined the way I imagined Anne and the others to have lived, happily ever after is what I expected."
"Positive","S.T.Coleridge (NOT T.S.Eliot): Excellent selection of poetry and poetry-related essays by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. NOTE: previous reviewer seems to have confused Coleridge with Eliot. Coleridge DID NOT WRITE The Waste Land, The Hollow Men, or Ash Wednesday -- THAT is why those are not in this book. He DIED in 1834!!"
"Negative","Poor listing: White-Washed Finish Splat Back Chair By Acme FurnitureYou would not believe your eyes if you see the picture for this product, and especially the listing that accompanies it. The picture shows one nice looking, wood made, dining chair at a more than reasonable price ($24 or $25 per item, it seems), and everything is wonderful, so far. But when you try to add it to your shopping cart the circus starts: just dare to see the weight of the item, and you'll need ice packs: 100lbs for one chair!!!If you are curious and go further checking their shipping rates, the ice is not going to help you anymore because you'll pass out: about $100 for the same!Clearly, I would not recommend this product to anybody."
"Positive","Entertaining Read: This book is exactly what I want from a 'chick-lit' book. Fun, humorous, with a touch of seriousness at times. A great beach read!"
"Positive","Provocative: Disturbing yet provacative. Reading this opinion has moved me two feet further to the right."
"Positive","Incredible show: A great blu-ray, with stellar audio and video. Quick cuts are kept in check, making it very enjoyable. For hardcore fans, setlist is good for the first half as we get new songs."
"Negative","Maybe Next Time: I first read several of the glowing reviews, got pumped up and listened to samples of the tracks. I'm disappointed again, sorry. I gave my copy of his first solo album away, and I won't spend my money for this one. Why? to have one of the most soulful voices I've heard (fantastic when the Bro./Sis. act was together)I just don't understand why such a vocal talent has to be wasted on such shallow material.He follows in a long tradition of great male gospel soloists such as Prof. Alex Bradford, and Rev. James Cleveland, and If he does want to do ""love"" songs, he could follow the tradition set by Teddy Pendergrass. Too bad those who select the material and the producers are ruining such a potentially great career. I guess I've just heard too many of the great singers who have gone on before, I'll wait for the next release. He'll finally get there I hope."
"Positive","Ideal for anyone: I first read this book as a beginner looking to get into reining. I found it easy to understand and the concepts very clear. I still refer to it constantly for training and conditioning tips. It's a very well written book, and is not at all 'difficult' to read. In fact, I found it hard to put down! A great book and well worth a look."
"Positive","""Tell It Like It Is"": This video should be placed in every school system across the nation. It is a text book in the form of a video. It is full of teachings that are from the heart. ""Tell it like it is"" will make you laugh, make you think, and have you running home telling the truth about everything. It teaches us that a simple thing like telling the truth can become a center piece for generations to come, instilling morals and love in all humans. Thank you Yolanda for sharing your vision with the world."
"Negative","actually i'd give it negatives if i could!!!: this has to be the most awful, pathetic, horrible, head throbbing, ear splitting, discrase to a rock and roll album that i have ever had the misfortune to listen to. i mean i would rather listen to spice girls and watch teletubbies on ice. i mean nothing can get much worse than this. ...! as soon as i got in my 76' chevette and popped it in my tape player, i could of swore my ears started bleeding. so i took the tape out and threw it out my window. and a huge semi 18 wheeler came passing me and crushed it into a zillion pieces. and thats where it belongs...on the side of the road in a zillion pieces so it wont harm anyone elses music listening. GOODBYE!"
"Negative","Not as good as the earbuds: These are not real expensive but I would reccomend the earbuds instead. They are OK but that is about all."
"Positive","Bissell Dual Brush Sweeper: After looking for a carpet sweeper for awhile. Decided to try looking on Amazon and see what's available. To make a long story short, it fills my needs, picking up dog hair. Although it clogs quite fast, it's easy to clean, light weight and most of all the dogs don't bark."
"Positive","(no title): this is an awesome book that is based on an awesome movie. I love this awesome book it is great"
"Negative","Benicio ""Way-Overrated"" Del Toro: A mechanical script, an unimaginitive director, and a deplorably monotone performance by the miscast Del Toro.Our first view of Del Toro in this film is of him doing what is certainly the worst reading of Shakespear ever in the history of the world. I literally thought it was some kind of sardonic joke the character was playing; but no, that was actually Del Toro attempting to act. Unfortunately for those of us who sat through this film, it only got worse from there. Somebody please tell Benecio that there is more to acting than merely reading aloud! (Or at least ask him to be awake the next time he gets in front of a camera.)Pewwww, what a stinker!"
"Negative","Rolling Kitchen Storage: Again, you get what you pay for. The doors don't line up properly. When I pulled on one of the doors the handle snapped off. The drawer doesn't line up as well. The drawer won't pull out (what good is it). Luckily I have a handy husband who can fix things."
"Negative","Not a Top: This is some kind of weird yo-yo, it's not a top. It won't spin. It comes with a string and a really sharp pointed bottom edge. There is no place to actually spin the thing. I just wanted something to play with at my desk and this is some kind of magic trick or something. Pretty awful product if you ask me."
"Negative","Junk: Should have listened to the other reviewers who said these cable ties are inferior. After the first two almost every one broke when I tried to tighten them. The package has the Monoprice brand on it and I'm kind of surprised because I've had good luck with Monoprice in the past. The package also states ""do not open until ready for use"", which tells me they have a useful life albeit short. I guess they expect you to use all 100 ties within 5 minutes of opening the package."
"Positive","YAY!!!: I'm so thankful that this is finally on dvd!!!! I'm so glad this show is finally getting the respect it deserves!!! I will watch every episode over and over again! I just hope the other seasons become avaliable on dvd."
"Positive","Caution on included batteries: I purchased six of these flashlights in July, 2008. I first noticed that the light was 'somewhat' dim but, not having too much experience with LED flashlights, I accepted this as 'normal'. I had the occasional reported problem with not lighting and having to shake the light or unscrew/re-screw the base to get it to work. Recently I decided to change the batteries (to a ""brand name"" battery) in all the units and what a surprise......all the lights were MUCH brighter than with the original batteries , except one, and the exception was that the acid had leaked from the batteries and ruined the contacts. My bottom line: all the 9-LED lights offered by different manufactures are probably the same, but the batteries make the difference. If you get these, throw away the included batteries and put three name brand ones in and be happy with your purchase."
"Positive","Excellent practical guide to personality disorders: I found this book to be funny, enlightening and very helpful in dealing with the vampires in my workplace and personal life. Albert Bernstein took the complex concepts of the psychology of personality disorders and made them understandable even to the layman. I was quite impressed!"
"Positive","Creepy: This movie gave me goosebumps the first time I saw it. It is so strange, so creepy, so different. Takes place in N.Y, a model Alison Parker decides she needs some time away from her boyfriend, Michael(Chris Sharandon) Alison, finds a cheap rent in this old brick apartment building. There are strange people who occupy the building, like a priest who sits staring out the window day and night. There are all other sorts of creepy people who live in the building, that Alison meets. What's scary is that, when she calls the realitor to complain about the noise in the apartment above hers...the realitor tells her no one but the priest lives in her building!!! Alison goes on a strange downward spiral after that, and the creepiest things start to happen to her. This movie made it on Bravo's Scariest Movies Top 100! It is a classic horror story!"
"Negative","Boring, monotonous and rushed edition: Not at all impressive, I could not listen and enjoy this recording, as it was done hurriedly and unexpressively. Try Scourby or Waggoner for an interesting, enjoyable edition."
"Negative","Disappointed by Hoover: I purchased my vacuum Nov 2006. Within the first year I replaced the on/off switch, which was covered by warranty and confirmed by my local vacuum parts dealer as a common problem with the Hoover WindTunnel. A few months later, after warranty expired, the dirt finder stopped working and the vacuum does not seem to be sucking enough because it cannot pick up fine dirt (like thread) from the carpet no matter what the height adjustment. Then the on/off switch broke again. This time I purchased the part and replaced myself because it was not under warranty and, in my opinion, not worth the cost of labor quoted. I previously owned a Hoover that lasted me 7+ years, and I am very disappointed in this Hoover."
"Positive","Now this is anime!!: I love anime and a friend told me about trigun, a this is a series worth your time and money. There's action, comedy, drama, and of course LOVE AND PEACE!!!! For 26 episodes the series of trigun is a classic, and should be picked up by any person who is a anime fanatic, and since the dvd set has all 26 episodes, it saves alot of time and effort when u can just watch them that way instead of looking for every dvd to the series."
"Positive","Great machine: I was determined to get a Workx GT until I did some research and read all the poor reviews. I looked around some more and the Black & Decker seemed to be the best electric trimmer for the $$. I have to say I am quite pleased with the machine. I was tired of dragging a cord around my yard - that would reach everything. I didn't want the weight or maintenance of a gas trimmer. I don't have a ton to trim so the battery life has been fine. The extra battery keeps me going until I'm finished. I love the trim guard that keeps me away from plants and keeps me from breaking string on my concrete landscaping border. The automatic string feeder seems to work fine so far.I'm glad I got this trimmer."
"Positive","Yeah, its good: Its a little over the top in parts for me, but there's no denying that Dorn knows what he's about. It is not as experimental as the likes of Autechre, Richard James/Aphex, and it isn't as slyly funky as Amon Tobin's stuff or the recent Funki Porcini, but Dorn gets quite a psychedelic groove going. Dorn also is pretty imaginative in his rythmic use and placement of samples. He hasn't quite ascended Mt. Olympus yet, but he's getting real close. Recommended."
"Negative","Not that good.: Game froze every time I entered ""Create"" mode. What can I say? I'm a creativity nut. This was even after I cleaned the disc. Let's just say, it's no wonder that there were only 2 Raw games and, altogether, 11 Smackdown games, from Smackdown 1 on PS1 through Smackdown Vs. Raw 2011 on PS2. The Smackdown series was always superior!"
"Positive","How does he manage to keep being so funny.: As a registered Dilbert addict I recommend this and all of hisworks. He has a brilliant wit, doesn't take himself seriously andwrites much better than he draws. His books are an essential read for anyone that works in or deals with the corporate world. The last sections of this book take a new direction where he ventures into speculation. Take that part seriously, unlike some of the other reviewers here, for he isn't joking about that. The book is a must read."
"Positive","Cry Baby: For Johnny Depp Fans, cry baby is not the usual movie that you would picture Johnny Depp playing. This movie takes place in the 1950s, a time when you were either a square or a drape. Johnny Depp is a drape that falls in love with a square, watch and see the fun musical about what happens when they make a square a drape. This movie also includes Ricki Lake."
"Positive","really simple and easy to use: It's a really innovative product, makes awesome coffee and is so low tech you could take it camping. Really brilliant."
"Positive","Late is better than never: I purchased this book ages ago now... but I thought I should give it a quick review...This book completely changed they way I look at head modeling, facial animation, and lip sync.I highly recommend this book to anyone even slightly interested in learning more about any of these topics and looking to create an edge in their skill set... I consider this book a 'killer app' of sorts."
"Negative","Bad Battery: I purchase this phone as a Xmas gift for my roommate. She didn't set it up until mid-February. Now, only 2 months after she started using it, the battery has died. My Sanyo phone did the same thing, but it lasted over a year before this happened."
"Positive","Blink's Back Better Than Ever: Blink 182's newest album, The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show, is their best. It has all of thier best songs (except for Party Song and Anthem). The live versions are much better than studio recordings. For instance, Going Away to College has a new harmony. You feel as is you are actually at the concert. Plus, Blink's new song, Man Overboard (which is studio recorded) is excellent. The only bad part of this CD is the immature jokes. They are disgusting and unfunny. But other than that, this CD is worth every cent."
"Positive","amazing sixties: unbelievable music ...groundbreaking...and to think this was recorded in 1968!!! Can anticipates punk and so much more...listen to this and think that the beatles were composing sgt. pepper..that pink floyd were composing atom heart mother...then step back and see who the true innovators of the era were...bottom line: this sounds as good and aggressive and important today as it did when i first heard it in '68"
"Negative","You would have to be an inbred to really love this movie: Kind of a boring horror movie that is not very scary or entertaining. I give it two stars because I like the creepy bald guy. There are a couple of cool scenes but it is nowhere near the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre(Or the new one, or any of the sequels for that matter!) One scene that kind of was scary was when the bad guys were going to eat a baby. That is kind of disturbing to any one who is human hopefully. I think the problem with this movie to me was I did not care about the characters. I was indifferent to their plight. Please rent this first before you buy it. I think you will thank me. Buy ""Last House On The Left"" instead. 100 times better."
"Negative","Security Loop is practically useless: I purchased this stapler because of the security cable loop that is practically useless because of its size and position.The angle and size of the too-small loop doesn't allow for the insertion of a security cable. I ended up having to feed a zip tie through the loop and attaching the zip tie to the security cable. Also, the stapler broke within a few weeks.The spring popped out and the accompanying directions don't describe where it belongs or how to reinstall."
"Negative","A dissapoinment.: This book deals with the alleged secrets revealed to three Portuguese children by Virgin Mary.From the beginning, the book's purpose is obvious: God sends a message that Communists are evil and if the world does not convert to Catholicism and bow before the Pope we are doomed. Communists, Freemasons and non Catholic population will burn in Hell by a God who demands of children to inflict pain on themselves by tying strings tightly on their limbs.This book has been a HUGE waste of both time and money. Open minded people should look elsewhere for a good read. I only wish I knew this before buying it."
"Positive","one of the top reggae producers of all time!: This CD is definitely one of the best reggae CD's ever produced, and as far as I'm concerned, it's Gregory's best. Everything about this album has a natural way of making you just want to groove with the music. Go Greg!"
"Negative","Nice design, poor quality: After about 4 mos. as my Time Machine drive it died. Lost all my backup and the drive will not mount and Disk Utility cant format it.The WD warranty is one year, but I am out the shipping cost to return it, plus my backup.The drive enclosure is fine, the rubber endcaps are nice. On/Off switch and low noise are great. Runs a tad hot, but the activity light has a pleasant glow.Overall, I like the drive, especially for the price. I just won't give it more than 2 stars since it failed in such a short amount of time."
"Negative","something is wrong!: after couple of restars my computer refuse to boot. i should try another one! card or computer!!!!"
"Negative","Well, it does grind pepper.: I bought the pepper grinder because of the one handed operation and the way it looked. It does grind pepper with one hand as advertised. My main complaints about this grinder are that it:A. Does not grind enough pepper per squeeze andB. Chunks of pepper are left even when on the finest settingYou could do much better than this grinder. The one handed operation is not worth putting up with large chunks of pepper all over your food. The pepper mill in your spice aisle at the grocery store does a better job."
"Negative","cheap & nasty: This product just lacked in quality. Plus, the disc was temperamental, it would get stuck, stop and start at regular intervals."
"Negative","Bad experience with AAA Toner on leaking cartridge.: I purchased a cartridge from AAA Toner. The black powder ink leaked shortly after using it. Black spots were on all of the printed pages and the powder ink was inside my printer. After paying a printer repair guy to come out and look at it and clean the inside, he showed me where the cartridge was bent and the powder leaking out. I attempted to obtain a replacement from AAA Toner, but they would not do so. If you are searching for recycle/refurbished cartridges, buy them from someone other than AAA Toner. They are not worth the hassle."
"Negative","Hmmm: Predictable. Unfortunately the movie felt like an after school special. The acting is really good, I just wish the storyline was better..."
"Positive","camera bag: It was fine smaller than expected. But it will work for me.It arrived timely and packaged well.Dale"
"Negative","disappointing: I was very disappointed in this product. The ornament was dated 2007, and that wasn't advertised. I felt like I was paying for a re-gifted itemI returned the item before xmas, using the return address on the box, which wound up being the wrong address, and had to pay an $8 to ups to have the package re-directed.Still don't have my credit...big disappointment all the way around."
"Positive","great read: I didn`t know this was a series of books based on 1 person,not that it matters you can start anywhere as I started on this one which is the 5th.I will go back and read the others.This is a real page turner,very well written and really keeps you interested."
"Negative","Annoying book then, annoying book now: I hated this book in high school and I hate it now. The author uses the words ""anyhow"" and ""old"" and ""to tell you the truth"" so many times on a page that it makes my head throb. Reading the book is like reading one continuous run-on sentence."
"Positive","Is there going to be a Director's Cut Version?: This movie is a critically under-rated 4 star guilty pleasure for me. But like the previous reviewer, I recently watched it on cable (AMC) with a completely different opening scene not included on my GI Jane DVD. The scene depicts Demi's character Luge-ing in skintight black vinyl suit in a failed attempt to win an Olympic time trial. Later, I watched several other scenes in the AMC re-broadcast not found on my DVD. So, does this mean there going to be a G.I. Jane ""Director's Cut"" Version?"
"Positive","Loved it, Loved it!!: I could not put the book down....there was always something new happening that had me intrigued. I loved the scriptures and ""thoughts out loud"" from the characters as they worked through issues in their head. Although I am not a pastor or a pastors wife the characters were relatable and still you learn and gain something from the characters struggles that you can apply to your own life."
"Negative","i'm in the minority here but...: first of all i hate negative reviews just because someone dislikes an ""interpretation"" of a piece, however i just coudn't find any thing good to say about this cd. dvorak's ninth is mine and many others favorite because of the lyrical quality of the symphony. kubelik seems to ignore this and go right for the drama. the timpani and horns are miked way too loud and the strings are an indistinguishable mush. you can find many better on budget labels. thanks for reading and this review applies only to ninth symphony."
"Positive","Good but not the best.......: I like the book, but it didn't have as much action as the #2, #3, and #4. Kristy and Claudia have a new English teacher named Ted while their old english teacher is out on materity leave. Things get off to a great start! Sadly though, when Ted hands out a list of books for recomedation, some parents aren't happy.If you want to read about the cons of book banning, then this is for you. I can't wait for #6!"
"Positive","A note for you........: Lynn Leistinger (Clifton Park, NY) :You can get Kill City on www.musicstack.com the original bomp green one.I had to post this here, so you'd get it. Couldn't find an e-mail address for you. I tried.Lol.You have great taste in music.Diane. :)))"
"Negative","Releases A LOT of electromagnetic radiation: I love the sound of this product. However, I am giving it one star because it releases A LOT of electromagnetic radiation. I use a Gauss meter to measure electromagnetic radiation for all my electrical objects -- especially the ones I sleep next to for many hours.I measured the Marpac Sleepmate and was atonished to see the meter go off the charts. I thought maybe I had a defective sound machine so I checked another Marpac Sleepmate and found the same problem. I have an electronic (non mechanical) sound machine (Sound Oasis) and it showed very little electromagnetic radiation.I prefer the sound and the quality of the Marpac to the Sound Oasis, but the amount of radiation is just too high to justify its use for so many hours at night."
"Positive","nice: My wife, kids and I are pleased with what we bought. Amazon is definitely a great place for home school supplies."
"Positive","A must read, inspirational guide book for living and loving.: Ever since I discovered the Urantia Book I cannot put it down. The Audio book has been incredibly helpful because the book is lengthy, and I listen to it while I'm driving to and from work. I initially started at Part I - The Central and Superuniverses, but got a little bogged down with all the new terminology, so I went straight to Part IV, The Life and Teachings of Jesus, which I just finished. I was moved to worshipful tears repeatedly. Part IV covers Jesus' life in beautiful detail, and explains how the early church got started, as well as the True Gospel of Jesus, which has gotten distorted through the ages. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand their personal relationship with God."
"Positive","Great guitar playing: Standout guitar playing and quality talent on drums and bass as well. You want a centric guitar CD to listen too and possible learn from this CD will not disappoint."
"Negative","This is going back: I was looking for some software to help my fourth grader with math facts, computations, etc. (He's an Everyday Math victim.) The activites, even at the most advanced level, are much too easy for him. Pointing and clicking at different piles of cookies is not division. This is a complete waste."
"Negative","A great disappointmnent: We bought this antenna for our new HDTV but were very disappointed for its poor performance. The reception was poor despite hours of tunning and optimal location. Some supplied brackets did not have holes drilled correctly making them useless. We had to find out substitutes from hardware stores. The workmanship was clearly inferior. On top of that, customer and tech support were very unhelpful and unprofessional.Overall, we cannnot recommend this product."
"Positive","Great book series: This is a wonderful book. Very well written. It's great to see that there are still fantasy writers on the level of Tolkien that don't write for children. (no offense JK)If you like fantasy read this book then watch the series on HBO it's also damn good."
"Positive","Easy-to-understand, straighforward Data Modeling Text: This is an outstanding text for dbms courses. I use it with another, more broadly-focused text in my dbms course. It has easy-to-understand diagrams and it is easy to read as well.Daniel A. Joseph, Ph.D. - RIT College of Business"
"Negative","To loud: To loud ,they also did not come with a battery for the panties!! They are very disappointing!!! Will not buy again!!"
"Positive","Ronson: Nice Variety of vocal and musical; in several arrangements, Ronson skillfully blends ""big band"" and modern sounds in a catchy, distinctive style not common in USA"
"Positive","african-american males: This is an exceptionally well written book of fiction by a African-American male."
"Positive","Fine album: I second the other reviews and add a bit of trivia. The cover photo struck me as oddly familiar, then I realised why. The Rolling Stones obviously parodied it for their '70 live album 'Get yer ya ya's out'I love it when pop culture cannibalizes itself. (As in Skynyrd/Neil Young,etc.)"
"Positive","Great Gift!: Collection of movies in this set is really good. I bought several of these DVDs for Christmas gifts and all the recipients were very happy. Seller delivered on time and product arrived in perfect condition."
"Negative","Good God Almighty!: I was reading this book on a flight from New York to Los Angeles and the flight attendants had a hard time preventing me from opening the hatch and throwing this out the door. I would reccomend pornography before I ever recommend this book. For the love of God, don't do this to yourself!"
"Positive","Take a chance and buy this.: I took a chance on buying this CD, as I only heard about it from a friend, and had heard no music from it. It ended up being truly one of the most worthwhile CD purchases I've made. My idea of music was so much more limited before this CD. I liked only a few of the tracks, and really didn't appreciate the grindcore tracks except for their over the top quality. But after a lot of listening it redefined music for me. It is truly refreshing and unlike anything I've heard. GREAT STEPPING STONE IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO SOMETHING DIFFERENT! I highly recommend.-Chris"
"Positive","A deep but easy to follow guide to SUCCESs in a world managed by the ideas: This book was chosen by many as the most important book of the year and I absolutely share that praise. If you want to success in nowadays environment, you really need to have clear ideas, with strong basis, easy to understand by others and with minimal possibility to get lost in the execution stage.Heath brothers made a profound research about the 'ingredients' of successful ideas, and in this book they share their findings, moreover, they teach you how to apply this principles in you daily life so your ideas can reach a high level of achievement.I believe that this book will become a classic and a it will be a basic reading, just because good ideas increasingly rules who wins."
"Positive","Great series!: Really enjoyed watching this video series! Full of information and quirky little re-enactments that keep each segment interesting and full of excitement! Would reccommend!"
"Positive","Grinder: A terrific machine overall. I would reccomend it to anyone who has a desire to grind their own flour and bake their own bread."
"Negative","3 Months and Already Out Of Print????: Lately Disney is making wrong choices with their shows. Zorro is a well loved series, and very much popular. You'd think that when Disney put this series on dvd, that it would be on sale for 2-4 years or so. I know there is a profit in selling the box set. So why did Disney decided to sell the set for a limited of 30,000??? That makes no sense. The box set came out in Nov 09, and 3-4 months later it's already Out Of Print. Seems pointless to sell the series, and then discontinue it so short of time. Very disappointing."
"Negative","You've lost the plot dude......: I used to be a good friend of Russ Pay - I hope he reads this review. Sort your (...) life out mate. You used to be a great musician and an inspiration to all that played with you. This is just a pile of toss. All I can say is that the money must have been good - or that George is feeding you too many narcotics. Sorry mate - it's (horrible) - however you probably already know that..."
"Positive","GREAT calculator, lousy manual: If there's a better calculator out there in the <$20 range, I haven't seen it. This is a huge step up from my wife's old fx-180P I had planned on using for the PRAXIS II math test (until I picked it up the other day and it rattled as I shook it).The road map-style manual is the only reason I took a star away from it. A booklet manual with an index would be a big improvement."
"Positive","Not just a story: I had as much fun reading this as my kids did. But its not just a story, its an I spy game to. We noticed that there is one baby that is upside down on almost all the pages, can you find her? And as the babies crawl after the bees and bats they begin to follow the babies, can you find them? We had many different ages enjoying this book - 2, 4, 6, 8 & 33!The black shadow drawing lets the kids use their imagination more."
"Negative","Unfortunately I had to give it at least one star: I'll keep it simple. Don't waste your time. This was the worst movie that it has ever been my displeasure to view in a theater. By the end of the show I wanted to strangle whoever it was banging on that [...] piano! If someone other than Kubrick had done it would have went the straight to video route."
"Positive","Good alarm clock.: Good alarm clock.I've had others recently that didn't work well. I got this one a few months ago and it works very well. My only complaint is that the nobs on the side stick a little when I'm setting the alarm, but that is minor. Over all it works very well in comparison to the others I had before and the price was reasonable."
"Negative","Blah: Not recommended. Very disapointing. Wished she had ALONE on the CD instead of Independence day."
"Negative","Doesn't work: This game isn't working for me. I don't know why If anybody can help please e-mail me at ToughGuy@aol.com. Watch out the first time I'm tried to play this game it crashed my computer."
"Positive","I'VE NEVER SEEN A GAME BETTER THEN MAX PAYNE!: Let's see where should I start?GRAPHICS> The picture is extremely smooth and detailed.GAMPLAY> Hard at first because up on the D-Pad is to walk and the left joystick's left and right are to turn. Left and right on the D-Pad are sidestep and down is to move backwards.FUNNESS> If I could put 999,999,999 stars I would.HARDNESS> If you like tough games search no more because this game is H-A-R-D HARD!OVERALL> This game is the best game for my PS2 and I have 27 games so far and this is #1-#1-#1! 100% goodness!!!!!"
"Positive","A POWERFUL STATEMENT ABOUT THE COMMODIFICATION OF SEX, WOMEN: John Briere, PhD, Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Psychology; Director, Psychological Trauma Program, LAC-USC Medical Center; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California""Hundreds of thousands of women are trafficked into the United States each year for sexual commerce, joining an even larger number of women and adolescents who are exploited as prostitutes, strippers, escorts, and pornographic objects. Melissa Farley has pulled together the work of some of the best researchers, clinicians, and advocates in this area, creating A POWERFUL STATEMENT ABOUT THE COMMODIFICATION OF SEX, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN IN OUR CULTURE. The information you will find in this volume is not pretty. But it will introduce you to a world that may have escaped your notice-hidden, as one of the authors notes, in plain sight. I VERY STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU BUY THIS BOOK . . . AND SHARE IT WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES."""
"Positive","Great creepy character (Melvin): I noticed this one got a lot of bad reviews - people talking about how Laymon's works published after his death weren't that good.I disagree - I liked this one. The main character Melvin is about as creepy as they come. Laymon does a nice job characterizing him and letting you know what is going on inside his head. There were a few times I actually laughed out loud over some of the things he said or did, only to cringe a paragraph later when he did something unexpected. It is nice to find a book where a character elicits that kind of response.The plot isn't very deep - this is more of a fun, easy read. So don't over analyze it - just go into the experience to have a good time and a few inappropriate laughs, and you'll like the book.The Kindle edition is put together very nicely. Margins are the right size, didn't find spelling errors, etc. Some of Laymon's works seem a little rushed with the Kindle editions, but this one is in good shape."
"Positive","Final Fantasy I & II Bundle: I ordered this for someone else who does absolutely love it, and who was surprised at how quickly it was shipped."
"Negative","The cables do not work well: The cables do not work well with the ipod 3rd generation. You cannot listen to the ipod while it is plugged into the power supply. All other cables work well while plugged into the power supply but these cable will not allow you to do it. I experimented with other similar cables and the ones that came from Apple for the ipod. They work well. I then exchanged to these cables and again had problem. They recharge okay with a power supply but you can't listen to music while they are recharging. My wife tried these cables on her ipod and had the same problem."
"Negative","""Michael York Ruins This Recording"" as previously stated: I love this particular book in the series and was sooooo disappointed when I began listening to it. I could not believe that the producer of the audio tapes wasn't cringing as I was every time Michael York slipped into his Aslan, lion voice....It was really pathetic......I agree with everything the previous reviewer said about the really poor job done on this reading. p.u."
"Negative","Not quite what I expected: The device is only ok. My biggest problem is that the picture is misleading. The arm does not bend and is actually completely straight, which means that it won't fit in my application. If the arm was flexible (or even rigid but bent as the picture shows) then I would have been happy with it..."
"Positive","The greatest in the series: Look Who's Talking Now is my favorite in the series of Look Who's Talking Movies - Danny DeVito and Dianne Keaton are a real treat playing the dogs, the plot is very enjoyable, Kirstie Alley and John Travolta make this movie shine, i especially like the dream sequences between the two.This movie is an underated must-see movie!"
"Negative","teeth of the tiger: slow no much action. clancy never finished writting the book. i felt somewhat cheated"
"Negative","NOT a ""Soft Spout"": I was disapointed to find that these ""Soft Spouts"" were actually HARD PLASTIC. They should not advertise them as ""soft."" I wasted my money and now more of my time. I will reorder and get the soft white spouts for 6mos. This item is for my preschooler who has become acustomed to the soft spout on the sippy cup that he uses at night to drink his water while we read books before bed."
"Negative","disappointing: I went in search of Vives' disks after realizing that he was the singer of La Gota Fria (which apparently is no longer available). I'm a big fan of Cuban music, and I'm just getting into some Columbian. Though I liked a few of these songs, they are too ""pop"" for my tastes. Some even bordered on the cheesy. I don't mean anything against Vives since his other disks have been better, but I really am not very fond of this CD."
"Negative","Awful, awful, awful, awful.......: Wish i could be more original than that but, it goes with the movie. AWFUL. I had to look away from the screen at points because everything was AWFUL!"
"Positive","Works Well: Have used this filter a few times now and really liked the results. Would give it a thumbs up for anyone that is looking for a soft focus effect."
"Negative","Don't buy this. It's not the REAL thing: Do NOT buy this from buy-it-now store. It is a cheap, cheap knock-off. The ""store"" did not respond to email and, of course, there's no phone #. If you want to REAL thing do not buy this."
"Negative","1st case was cracked: the only problem i had with this purchase was when it arrived the first case on the top was cracked..."
"Positive","Great album but not a classic...: This is a great album but far from a classic to me. I really enjoy the diversity it brings and continues to get rotation in my car but its not an album I tell people they have to have."
"Positive","Pop til you drop: The first time you listen to Brousal, you keep thinking, wow, that sounds like some other great singer. Wait, now it sounds like THIS other great singer. Then you start to recognize the unique tone to her voice and inventiveness of her music and you stop thinking about those other has-beens.This is a great CD -- and I'll bet she's even better live!"
"Positive","Cap gets disassembled: Collecting storyarcs featured from the last run of the current volume of Captain America and from Captain America & The Falcon, Captain America Disassembled finds Cap a little more than battle worn after what's been going on with the Avengers. Robert Kirkman (The Walking Dead) scripts the first arc, which is the main highlight here as Cap fights off against the Red Skull and the usual array of rogues. The Captain America & Falcon story is nothing special though, even though Modok makes an appearance (and every Marvel fanboy knows he's worth a laugh or two). The art in both collections is solid, and Kirkman's story makes this volume worth picking up for Cap fans. Captain America is getting relaunched yet again though, under the helm of Ed Brubaker, which is also worth picking up."
"Negative","Warranty Problems: Warranty ProblemsCannot regIster earbuds as valid serial number yealds a ""this serial is invalid."" Is a warranty really available?,"
"Positive","I wish I could give it five stars. I really do like it, but..: This is a lovely design and it spins beautifully even in mild winds but why in the world did the designers allow the inner spinner to be able to reach the outer spinner? The small spinner on the inside, when things get going very fast, will wildly swing out and loudly clang with the outer spinner. I don't understand why the inner spinner isn't slightly smaller or the outer spinner isn't slightly larger. If they didn't have the ability to touch this wouldn't be a problem. Still, it's a very nice little wind spinner. I just thought that was an odd oversight."
"Positive","Last Breath: The Limits of Adventure: Conventional wisdom has it that dying out in the snow of hypothermia is a gentle, nearly painless way to go. Dreamy. This intriguing book presents more details and morereality on this, and several other ways of dying. I'm rereading it and sharing it with others. Good for conversations. I'm assuming that the author researched and that it ismostly medically correct."
"Negative","Lousy waste of money: This is NOT a steam cleaner. No steam involved. The bristles don't move. We spilled something wet and immediately tried to steam clean it. All it did was drip some water on the spot and then suck it back up. We don't have thick carpets, but I know it didn't get any sort of deep clean. Tried it on an old spot, too, and the steamer didn't clean that up, either. We're taking it back for a refund. Try another steam cleaner!"
"Negative","hated it: boring ,no fun game, my 5 year old daughter hated it, passwords have to written down, the only one who might enjoy this game probably doesn't have any other gameboy game to play with."
"Positive","Jim Gaffigan-Beyond the Pale: Beyond the Pale is the latest album from comedian Jim Gaffigan. Jim Gaffigan is a lesser known, but now gaining fame due to the show My Boys and appearences on Comedy Central, comedian who has to be one of the most talted in the field to emerge in a long time. Gaffigan combines dry wit, with a slightly more absurd comedic style in his act. He is also known for giving his own running comentary on his act in a softer voice, often from the viewpoint of an audience member. Overall, this album features some of the funniest comedy to come along in a while and is truely worth picking up for anyone who enjoys intelligent comedy, with a bit an absurd twist."
"Positive","Good and fast in operation: The flash drive is fast in copying files and data. I had tried with big files, and it seems to be pretty fast and its unique design of gripping makes it easy to handle and install to a USB port."
"Negative","not about a cooking school: Very disappointing, the only good thing in it is the food. It's terribly condescending and author's ego is all over the place. But the most annoying part is that while it claims on the back that this is a book about a cooking school and anyone about to open a small business should read it, this is not the case at all. She only talks about the school a bit at the beginning and then we are just left with her life, her view of the French, which is not very exciting, and an awful lot of adjectives."
"Negative","Caution, no CD+G: I was anxious to get this CD and received it quickly. However, I was disappointed to find out that this CD does not offer graphics. At least, graphics to not seem to work with my CD+G Karaoke machine - though I've not had a problem with others."
"Negative","Horrible Movie: The sound track was alright. Thus, the reason I gave this movie one star. Other than that, I wish I had never watched this movie. This is a depressing movie about four 4o something year old college buddies who have a sort of reunion in this luxurious beach house. Their reunion consists of doing drugs, feelings sorry for themselves, and having a pity party. And those aren't even the worst parts. Save yourself the agony and find something more productive to do with your time and money."
"Negative","Pale Imitation Of Duke Nukem 3D: Nowhere near as good as the Duke Nukem 3D for IBM platform. Looks a lot like Contra from the NES days. If you are looking for the same action as Duke Nukem 3D, look elsewhere as this does not contain first person graphics, Duke sound effects, etc. I am very sorry that I bought this."
"Negative","not a good book if your child is not a math wiz: This is a terrible math book. There are very sparse explanations to help students or parents get help if they don't understand a topic. All the book consists of is a bunch of example problems. My daughter had a book from a different series/publisher in sixth grade that was great. The school switched to this series/book when she got to seventh grade. The seventh grade book (this one) was not at all helpful."
"Negative","a noisey shaver: I am so far disatisfied with this purchase because it is so loud when it is running that I am almost ready to use ear plugs. It cuts my beard o.k. and the trimmer works well and is easy to clean but annoying compared to my old rotary head shaver"
"Positive","Jogging headphones for people with little earholes: These are my jogging headphones. They don't fall off when I run, and I run with more than the average bounce, if you know what I mean. And I have small ear-holes, so other headphones start to hurt, pressing against my ear canal in a suprisingly agressive way."
"Positive","Great toy: My daughter sits at this all the time. She had no trouble getting in and out of it and loves the storage space. It was very easy to assemble, even without the predrilled holes."
"Positive","Radon Detector Works Great: This radon detector arrived quickly and works great. I am able to monitor the level of radon in my basement and see when it fluctuates up and down. If it gets too high and stays there I will be able to know when it is time to mitigate for the radon and keep my family safer."
"Negative","Foreigner and Dire Straits are billions better..................: AC/DC are just as bad as Nirvana. Bon Scott sings so horribly, and just sounds like a dying duck who just screams. The fact is, AC/DC they've only made a single decent song in the title track ""Highway To Hell"". The rest of the other albums and songs are terrible. I'm glad both Kurt Cobain and Bon Scott are DEAD!!! Thankfully they will never annoy me again. For good lovely music, get Foreigner and Dire Straits instedwho were a billion times better than this lousy AC/DC album.Avoid this and Nevermind of Nirvana 2 of the worst albumsever."
"Positive","HANGMAN'S DIARY WITH A VIGOROUS STYLE: Franz Schmidt's diary is written in a pity, vigorous style which probably reflects the way he went about his unenviable business. The supporting material is just what is needed to make us understand the world of Franz Schmidt."
"Positive","you learn mathematics by doing it.: I used this book for a course I taught at the University of Connecticut. It has a lot to offer, especially for the price. Sample problem: draw a bunch of lines across a piece of paper. Can the resulting picture be colored only in black and white, with no adjoining regions sharing the same color? Works through examples like this one in excruciating detail, encourages the reader to sweat through problems, the payoff coming when you start to see patterns not in the problems themselves, but in how you approach them. Last chapter consists entirely of problems, with suggestions on how to attack, and then extend them."
"Negative","totally misadvertised: The coasters are NOT glossy or made of pretty stones as they appear. They look like a cardboard printout picture of the rocks on top of a coaster. Absolutely dissatisfied and NOT at all worth the price. These look like something I would have paid 3 dollars for at a thrift store, not to mention I bought them new and they have clearly been used. DO NOT buy this item."
"Negative","Don't waste your money!: Very unhappy! Just got this in, no box, no case, plain plastic bag. Had to force batteries in, then the LED doesn't turn. The image is way too shaky to see IF you can even get it to focus at all. Not worth the postage to send it back...Caveat Emptor!"
"Negative","Concerns about the Brenthaven Edge I Sleeve: I just received the Brenthaven Sleeve for the Black MacBook that I just boughtfrom Amazon. I wouldn't call it a sleeve because that implies that you canslide your laptop in from the top. It is more of a zip-open luggage style case.There is also a zippered compartment inside the case, and I am concerned thatthis zipper might rub against and scratch the MacBook. It is also so snug inside,it's a struggle to get the laptop seated. I'm wondering if I was sent the right case.On the plus side, it is very well constructed, but don't think it's right for me."
"Negative","Cheap, but still not worth it: The item quit working after about a week of use. It just simply quit playing CDs altogether. I procrastinated and waited longer than 30 days to seek a refund, now I'm stuck with sending it back to the manufacturer. They require a $6 shipping/handling fee, which is too much considering the cost of the item. I'll just trash it and buy a Sony, which I should have done in the first place."
"Positive","Good Read: This is a well written first-hand account from an actual POW in Vietnam. Mr. Anton does an excellent job of detailing his experiences."
"Positive","Kick ass: It's so funny reading reviews from little kids who've watched these movies in 2000 and 2001 for the first time. I'm 21, so I was a kid when the first ""Child's Play"" came out in 1988! I LOVE Child's Play 2. It's my favorite of the set. Part 3 I thought sucked. I remember a scene when Chucky steps out and says the equivalent of ""Boo"" and the victim makes this HUGE scene like he's been shot and dies of his own accord. Dumb. Bride of Chucky is just funny as hell, so I have to give it a good review. Overall, I'd love to have it, so thumbs up on this set!"
"Negative","the hell?: after seeing Casino Royale, i assumed that whoever was in charge of the James Bond franchise was doing everything they could to make it fantastic. then i saw Craig's sequel... what a motherloving let down! Quantum of Solace, the best thing about it was its title.in short, Casino Royale might be the best Bond movie ever. Quantum is one of the worst i've seen. oh, how the mighty have fallen. the third Craig Bond film will make or break the franchise, i believe. and a tip for the writer, allow James to have sex with a woman who actually survives!D"
"Negative","BLESSINGS SHOULD'VE BEEN TITLED BORING!!!: WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. NOT ONE OF ANNA'S BEST WORKS. THE CHARACTERS LACKED DEPTH AND THE STORY DRAGGED ALONG LIKE A SLOW DEATH. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."
"Negative","FAKE: This Product is fake. Doesn't work with any card reader on the market. Upon opening product nothing is inside. Be wary with anyone who currently sells this card."
"Negative","What's become of the Great American Songbook?: This is a collection of the cream of the cream of the Great American Songbook by a rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing at all to American culture. This rate #1 is to express my deep deception about the successful album series.Over exposed material which has been treated so many different ways by so many different vocalists with artistry should be treated respectfully.I am not a dictator but I would vote for a Law that would impose respect for some art expressions which represents the treasure of American culture.More than that, the series success reflects lack of understanding of the music context by people who should search for entertainment in a more valid and truer way.That's the deal: there is truth missing, there is a sensation of a money-make production. Mellow arrangements, neglectable performances, lacking creativeness. To be completely forgotten some years ahead."
"Negative","Book lacks orginality, writing stilted: I bought this book hoping to find some answers. All I found was cobbled together new age claptrap. One chapter hardly relates to another, and all the ads at the back made me feel like this author just threw anything out there just to get an opportunity to sell me something else which I found personally offensive. The bottom line on this confused melange is that the book is so poorly put together and badly written that it's an insult to readers. The Radical Forgiveness theories are not only, not original, but also very hopeless because the author advocates that we are not responsible for anything that happens. The book's title is also a rip-off of the book, ""Radical Honesty."" The story in the back on Princess Diana is a tastless attempt to weave some celebrity connection to the author, and after what he said about the poor woman in the story I was disgusted that he had the nerve to dedicate the book to her. What an insult!"
"Positive","Magnificent follow-up: What a good tie in. It follows the story line as seemlessly as Frank Herbert's original does."
"Positive","great mp3 player: I recently bouht this mp3 player for myself. Although I have never bought one before, I was very impressed with its sound quality, size, and memory. If you are looking for a good mp3 player for a low price, this is probably the one for you."
"Negative","not hard enough: this cd is ok... i like the lyrics i guess but someone being used to harder rock i just dont like this cd. the person who sings isnt all that good either."
"Positive","Very entertaining: This is the first of Steve Berry's books that I've read. I liked it so much that I bought all the novels by him that I could lay my hands on (from my favorite local used books store). It is action packed and well researched. I admit that the conclusion of the book seems a bit far fetched. His depiction of the Vatican's intrigues do not seem very far from the truth though (except perhaps for the murder parts). It is the kind of novel that I find perfect to relax at the end of the day or on vacation."
"Negative","WAY TOO SHORT: These wraps are a youth length and THE AD SHOULD HAVE STATED SO!!! Way too short for any practical use, coverage or protection."
"Positive","Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids -Vol 2: This series is great for teaching Character Education. You have the concept/Character Trait, then the story centered around the topic/concept, followed by music.This is a great teaching tool!"
"Negative","Worthless Seed Sower: This product is worthless...does not work as advertised! I would not recommend this product to anyone! Wolf Garten makes a cheaper model EAM that works much better than this thing!"
"Positive","Great vacuum, affordable price: We had a Dyson vac which worked great ... until it broke. Getting it fixed would've cost a lot just in shipping. You see, there really are no repair shops in the States for Dyson. So, we threw our $300+ vacuum away after about a year's use. We bought the Bissell a few months ago. Having just bought a new wool rug that sheds like crazy (easily fills the dirt receptacle twice every time I vacuum). Also, we have a 2 yr old, three dogs (2 boxers, one mix breed puppy) and a cat, so we vac A LOT.The Bissell is excellent - great suction, multiple tools on-board and a nice detachable section (we don't have stairs, but if we did this would make cleaning them a breeze). You can turn off the rotating brush, which is great for tile. It's got a HEPA filter (I mentioned our animals, right?) which makes me feel like our air's maybe a bit better than it would be. Very happy overall (the bagless system is great, but lost a star as the receptacle could be a little bigger)."
"Negative","wears out too quickly: These paticular wacoal bras wear out too quickly for me,lasting only a few months,even though I still keep wearing them at $60 a pop!!! The other issue I have is the underwires in these bras are always cut too short and never go from point A to point B, so they poke me in my side!!! and the third issue is that the underwire area is always too scratchy under my breast."
"Negative","Defective: Unbelievable - the product received didn't work. Since amazon is not the seller, the seller doesn't accept returns, says I must deal with the manufacturer; I say to the prospective buyers - buy only from amazon directly so you can return if the product doesn't work"
"Positive","The Education of Little Tree: This was a fabulous movie. I loved it. Very informative about the Native American children who were forced to go to the Christian schools and how they were abused. I real eye opener. Must see."
"Negative","Mr Bell A wolf in sheeps clothing bewaire: Please ask God for understanding of the word and not man. Man can twist and send the wrong message. God Bless"
"Positive","Kindle Ease: I bought this for my wife for our anniversary. She usually does not like using technical products but she loves her Kindle. We took it on vacation and she was able to sample books and buy another one without having to lug around 3-4 books in her suitcase. It is easy to use and she never has to ask for help on how to use one feature or another, it is very intuitive. The only negative I can give it is that it is too easy for her to order books now! But at least they max out at $10 instead of the $15 to $27 that she normally pays.GREAT PRODUCT!!!"
"Negative","Disappointing: I was so looking forward to this game. Unfortunately it was not what I had hoped for. I would not recommend it for true gamers."
"Positive","Andre Bernard Lives in this Book.: This is a wonderful book that keeps Andre Bernard's thoughts and teachings in the technique of ideokinesis.I recommend this book for actors, dancers and people of any profession!It speaks clearly to having a healthy mind-body relationship with an understanding of how our body parts fit together.The reader will have a journey that leads to a pain free body and sensible postural pattern.A must read!"
"Positive","It is a full circle.: Once I read this book, all others were compared to it. I feel like a story should come in full circle. This one did. It's rare you find a book that you feel like you've accomplished something when you're finished. You've learned, you've smiled, cried...everything!! Classic DS"
"Negative","a story like the slug: this story is nothing like the wind. this book could be good if he cut out more of the details and and wrote more about what is actually happening he has to detail it so much teach chapter could be 12-16 pages long."
"Negative","Kindle Version Really Bad!!: Bought this for use in the field. Useless, as uses ""locations"" instead of page numbers. There are no page numbers on the pages to find your place.Additionally, while turning the pages one jumps several pages ahead and must go back to the contents to navigate.Absolutely worthless!"
"Positive","Delightful mix of non-stop gore and humour: EVIL DEAD focusses on five college students who go to stay at a holiday house not knowing that it is ruled by demons. Four become possesed leaving the hilarious Bruce Campbell to get rid of them, the results are extremely grusome and wildly funny. Followed by EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN which I thought was even better."
"Positive","An Unquiet Mind: This book was startling, unsettling but insightful into the mind of a woman who deals with bipolor disorder. I had to put it away at times and come back to it because I felt such sympathy for the author having to go through what she did in life. I lent it to a friend who's daughter is bipolar."
"Negative","Shipped with part missing: This watering can is nice, but like a number of other reviewers, mine came without the removable rose attachment that the product description promises. I give it only two stars for that reason. Those other reviews were posted months ago -- this problem should have been fixed by now. Annoyed!"
"Positive","Great product for the price: I don't use all the features but it's a great product nonetheless. It still leaks though from time to time when you switch from the upright position to the ironing position frequently."
"Positive","Best Pots Ever: If you are a serious cook, these are the only pots to buy! These pots last forever and cook evenly."
"Negative","Buyer Beware: When I first purchased this vacuum I was very impressed with the ability it had to suck up pet hair. I have a cat and a dog and it seemed to work wonderfully at getting the hair out of the carpets. However, 9 months later the vacuum has become a piece of junk. It simply blows the dirt it ""sucks up"" right out the back side of the vacuum and back all over the area just vacuumed. I am not the only person experiencing this, I had recommend the vacuum to a friend that told me the other day he ended up so mad that he threw it out into his yard and went back to his 20 year old Kirby. And his machine is only about 6 months old. Since both of these units were purchased through Amazon, there seems to be no recourse on any type of return warranty coverage. The only thing that sucks with this vacuum is the fact that I paid $90 bucks for it!"
"Positive","Awesome brow product: Once I tried Bare Minerals Brow Color I knew I'd never bother with anything else again. Makes filling in and shaping my brows so easily and error-free."
"Positive","Red Skelton Christmas: The most loved comedian that ever lived I believe. I gave each of my kids this CD for a Christmas present. They grew up with listening and watching Red Skelton. Now that they are adults with kids of their own, they have their kids watching Red Skelton."
"Negative","Hard to stay awake...: This film is really boring, filled with non-sense and poor production.How can this movie can be nominated for seven Academy Awards ? I really don't know. It is supposed to be Brad Pitt's best performance...I disagree, he is very common actor in this one. He has done better in almost any of the film he was involved. Bad and boring film..."
"Positive","it works fine: It's a mount. It works. It's sturdy. I think it was pricey but I needed it for the projection unit."
"Negative","Doesn't Do Anything: I used this product for about 7 months. When I ran out recently it took me awhile to order some more. I haven't been using this product for about three weeks now and my skin is no different (actually it might be looking a bit better). I have combination skin and am prone to brake outs on my chin with some minor blemishes on my cheeks from time to time. This lotion has salicylic acid in it which is supposed to be good for acne prone skin. My breakouts never improved while using this product and now that I've discontinued using it, I haven't noticed any difference except that my skin actually seems to be looking clearer. Needless to say, I won't be restocking this item in my medicine cabinet since I never saw an improvement in my skin while using it. I'm still using Active Moist as my general facial moisturizer."
"Negative","Messy and easily broken feeder that attracts bees: This cheap plastic butterfly feeder was a very short lived educational toy for my 6 year old daughter. It broke within the first few days even with gentle handling, it leaked and it attracted bees and we never once saw a butterfly come anywhere near it."
"Positive","The bible on infant sleep: I buy this book for all my friends who are new parents. It is the definitive book on solving sleep issues - Dr Mindell's has written a scientifically sound book that is accessible and reasonable. The thing I like best about it is that it gives parents choices and the opportunity to actually ""parent"" their children to sleep, rather than just parrot a checklist of what you should or shouldn't do. I also find it to be very easy to read, which is just as important, especially when you are at the end of your rope and sleep deprived."
"Positive","Story Telling at its Best!: This page turner displays Anderson's wonderful capabilities for writing science fiction and fantacy masterpieces"
"Positive","Great book for expectant parents: This is an outstanding book that should be read by both expectant parents. It discusses not to raise a child that is how an A student, great athlete, or future world leader, but rather how to raise a student who does well in school, life, and society.Mr. White interviewed parents from different cultures and child rearing methods and gives the reader straight advise on methods to improve your child's chances for success in their life ahead. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is ready to have their first and also as a re-read to those working on their second, third, etc. A definite must!"
"Positive","Simply Outstanding: I can relate to Sutherland's role as a bitter old man with Parkinson's. My father is in this very condition and the Donald plays it perfectly. This could not have been an easy part for him. All the acting was supurb for that matter. Excellent film, my wife and I highly recommend.If this movie touched you, also try 'Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont'."
"Positive","Product is exactly as ordered: I received the exact item that is displayed in the picture. All if the correct warnings and labels as well. Frontline and Advantage are the only two products I have yet to try for my cat's fleas. I will change the rating if and/when I see the results. I'm starting at 4 stars because I was worried that I would receive a product unlike what is shown/ordered. (As others have stated) I will update the review on the results soon.Update: After over 24 hours, the cats have stopped scratching. So far so good!"
"Positive","Honest & sweet: This movie has heart & touches anyone who has found themselves out of work due to their lack of education. It is well-written & easy to watch & enjoy."
"Positive","Handy kitchen tool: Very handy and a microwave user must-have. Much easier to use to cover small bowls and cups. I love using this for making ramen noodles in the microwave. And just covering bowls of soup. And much better than using those large microwave covers that take up most of the microwave. Also, it seals well but pops off easily to remove."
"Positive","A thought or two: I do like this album - there's something about Mirwais' in-your-face-bass that really hits the spot. The difference in styles between the various co-producers on each track is particularly noticeable - overall, however, I would say that this is an album that is poignant while remaining strikingly simple.For those who criticise ""mindless drum machines"", I put forward what I remember of a quote by Bjork. She said that, if the music has ""no soul"", people tend to point the finger at the computer. However, Bjork suggests computers are just a tool, like guitars or pianos. If the music has no soul, that is because no one has put it there - it's not the fault of the computer.I believe that Madonna given this album a soul. You decide for yourself."
"Negative","Worthless: I found this book to be a waste of money. One just doesn't know why some pivots have been considered and some not considered at all. In effect: Total Waste"
"Negative","WHAT IF BARRY MANILOW SANG TOM WAITS?: Okay, Tom is one of those artists who's music transfers well to almost anyone's interpretation. They are just damn good songs, and it's hard to mess up a good song. But listening to this music is like hearing Tom Waits emasculated, or maybe a Stepford Tom Waits. Hammond's voice and delivery doesn't even approach the pathos or spirit of Tom's. Sure it has a nice ""Blues groove"", but the spirit of Waits is lost in this recording. If Tom's music is smoked brandy,this music is a blended daiquiri with a paper umbrella. Holly Cole, who is, sometimes, so upbeat I want to slap her, gives a much more sensitive, gritty, and moving performance of Waits' songs than this Julie-Andrews-Guy. If you want mediocrity, buy this cd. If you want artistry, pass it by."
"Negative","Please!: Are you kidding me, this isn't progressing this is the exact opposite. Yeah its progressing if like like your hardcore all fluffy. This album has it good moments but over all it is a let down from their previous albums. I really like this band though and I hope their next release gets alot more heavy. If you can find it check out Bleeding Through first album Dust To Ashes, now that's brutal."
"Positive","very soothing: My clients love this CD. I had no idea how many people are annoyed by new age-y music while being massaged. Perhaps annoyed is a little strong. However, I've never had so many compliments on what music was being played during a massage until I started playing classical. It has all been positive."
"Positive","An excellent primer for web project management.: Clearly, the web as we know it will only become more and more ingrained in our businesses and our society. As a relative neophyte to the Internet space I found this book to be invaluable in developing a better understanding of web development. Probably, the best thing about the book was its focus on practical applications and real world examples. The Internet of the 1990's was filled with industry jargon and pie in the sky ideas that have gone the way of the dodo (and Internet stocks sky high valuations). If someone is looking for how to develop a web site the right way, right away then this book is a great place to start."
"Positive","Its not an experiment - its a fact!: The Intention Experiment is a great book to explain a powerful force that has been known by humans for thousands of years. Now 'science' can confirm it. Truly this is not 'new' - but that is not an attack on the author or the book - they deserved full marks (and its a great read) - what is interesting is the fact that this is the discovery of how manifesting works, which was taught by Wattles, Haanel, Edison, Hill, etc wrote about and taught for so many years.You can understand why/how it works with 'The Intention Experiment', but if you want a set of instructions on how it works just for you to get what you desire - just go back to the source:Think And Grow Rich: The Personal Study EditionThe Master Key System: The Personal Study EditionPath To Prosperity - Mastery Of Destiny - Acres Of Diamonds: The Personal Study EditionThe Science of Getting Rich: The Movie - 2 Disk Set"
"Negative","I will not purchase until the extended version is released.: Greed is always a bad thing in the end. It is shame to tarnish such a wonderful landmark movie with such a greedy attitude of withholding the extended version for so long. 2011 or 2012; you got to be kidding me. By the time the actual extended version is released will I still want to buy it? Who knows, but I do know I won't be buying the theatrical version. I'd rather re-watch my extended version LOR DVDs which look pretty good played with my PS3's up scaling."
"Positive","Worked perfect: Placed it in the car and did the job. Reverse lights started working and I finally passed the safety inspection for my car."
"Positive","You have to work to live: This book is perfect for advanced beginners who are ready to continue disciplining their game. The slow building of complexity, the ordering of patterns, and the perfectly framed problems make this book hugely useful. Less experienced players be warned, however; Davies often boldly pronounces many statements that would be self-evident to more advanced players, but which may be more cryptic for starting players. Consider the perfunctory ""Since each half of the white group touches both of the internal liberties, White is alive"" (page 17). Having studied the problem, laid it out on the board, and worked through variations, I am pleased to say I NOW understand precisely what Davies means (and I'm a far better player for it, given the ubiquity of this arrangement). But without a board and stones nearby and some patience, this statement would have required more textual explanation for someone at my level (maybe 13 kyu?). In other words, prepare to GET TO WORK to improve your game."
"Negative","Old Heinlein: Book was recommended to me because it had some very interesting parallels to the Iraq War. It's old Heinlein and even old sci-fi so the writing style drips of this. A very ""ok"" book with only a couple scenes that I thought were extremely well written. But liked some of the attitude of the characters as they were very realistic to being in a war. But overall a book you can definitely skip."
"Negative","Okay movie....but: It was an evening's entertainment. If you like the adventure of violent storm, graphic injury, with an aggressive bear on the chase, it could hold your attention. The story is of a step-mother and teen coming together, with the father actually paying attention to the teen. I see how it is the teen could say her step-mother was a know-it-all. She was a bit too well informed, even in my opinion. The teen does rise to expectation, but the wrap-up scene of a very pregnant mother, with a very revealing neckline was a very unexpected scene. It is not a movie I would choose to watch again, nor recommend to others."
"Positive","Love them!: I loved this earrings. When i purchased them i read everyones reviews first and i thought they where going to be too big. Not at all!. I think ill also buy the 8mm ones. the size is perfect. They can be passed as diamonds at a distance specially if you are wearing them with other cz stuff. Also the price is way too good to say no."
"Negative","Yawn...: This movie was incredibly slow. I fell asleep twice. If you are going to go based on the good reviews, rent it first and decide if you want to buy it. I will do that from now on with these independent films that are rated high. What a let down. The acting was ok, filming was a bit wobbly, and the story was good. What made this real boring was the narration from the main character. They were trying to fill in the blanks. Maybe it would have been worse if they didn't. Overall, I did not like it."
"Positive","Worth buying!: Now one would think that a rap song about a washed-up comic book character would be silly and/or stupid, but believe it or not, this song is pretty pimped out. And I agree with Mr. Heering, it's alot better than the two versions on the soundtrack album. I higly recommend this disc."
"Positive","Amazing!: Over the years, I'd heard snippets of the story of 5 missionaries who were killed trying to reach a tribe of people civilization had not touched. I finally purchased the book, and could hardly put it down. I learned how hard it is to be a missionary - all the things you must do in addition to sharing God's love. I was amazed at the dedication the men had to reach these people, knowing they might lose their lives. I was also amazed at the peace the wives had once they learned of their husbands' deaths. The trust they all had in God's ultimate plan was a challenge I hope to attain."
"Negative","Boring and dreary!: Having bought the Lifescapes ""Just Relax Mexico"" CD and LOVED it, I thought this one would be good too. WRONG!!! The music is slow, dreary, and depressing...even annoying. Skip this one!"
"Negative","What an awesome DVD this could have been, if Geffen hadn't ruined it.: Finally we get the entire music video collection from Queensryche. Unfortunately, somebody who should be shot, decided it would be cool to have the band talk over the start of nearly all the music videos, essentially ruining them. Geffen & whoever was in charge of this project screwed up in a major way! This could have been one of the best DVDs out there..."
"Negative","not as described: Contradictory to the description of the product there are no English sub-titles. Movie by itself is phenomenal but only my children (they are speaking French) can enjoy it. Hungarian sub-titles are not very helpful."
"Positive","nice scent: My husband sits by the pellet stove to relax. It's in the basement which gets musty, once in a while. I thought the cedar incense would be a pleasant masculine scent for him. We both love it. I took some to use in the living room. At Christmas, I burnt these every day to add to the spirit of the season."
"Positive","Very well written novel: This story held my interest on every page. It was very well written, and very interesting. It was a great escape for me. :)I won't re-write what this story is about because other reviewers have done a very good job of it.There is a lot of interesting things going on in this novel, yet it was easy to keep track of and a very easy, fun book to read.I took one star away only because I wanted to like the main character more than I did. Actually, I didn't like either her or her husband. I really liked the mule trainer though. I highly recommend this book, and it doesn't matter much if you like the main character, she is interesting."
"Negative","Mental / Emotional Rape = Love: I loved the first 150 pages of this book. The characters were fun and the settings were interesting. Everything was great until the hero and heroine met. Then the whole book went south.The Rest of the book is about Derek's desire to have sex with Chantelle. And the sex is his only desire. He doesn't know anything about her and doesn't seem to care. He never even asks what her real name is, although he insists that she use his real name. He's manipulative, selfish, and pretty much 'seduces' her into the sex. (Where I come from that's called emotional rape.) I ended up hating him, and not understanding why she loved him. Frankly, I thought Chantelle would have been better off with one of the eunuchs.But of course he falls in love with her (falls in love with having sex, because they never have a conversation about anything else. How can you love a complete stranger?) and it all works out. Blah. I won't make the mistake of reading another Johanna Lindsey book."
"Positive","Great Shop Vac: I use this vacuum to clean up all kinds of messes I created in my work shop. It works great. It has a bit of a high pitched whine to it, but it is not nearly as bad as some of the negative reviews stated. It has excellent suction, and picks up sawdust, wood chips, metal drilling remnants, nails, screws, and all the other junk I drop on the floor or bench. The hose has two positions in the vacuum hose holder itself; one is just to hold the hose, and the other, if pushed all the way forward, is to run the vacuum scoop on the front of the vacuum. I think the people who complained about the power of this vacuum forgot to push the adaptor all the way forward to make an air tight hook up to the scoop. The weight and size makes it very handy, and it gets into all kinds of tight places. Best shop vac I have ever owned."
"Negative","Success remains out of reach for Flash on final album.: By this, their third album, it was quite obvious that Flash were not going to give Yes a run for their money. In fact, Flash wouldn't even come close to matching Yes' commericial and artistic successes. A lame concept album about some guy from the Planet Catalina, Out Of Our Hands stumbles in the usual places: weak vocals, inane lyrics, lack of keyboards, etc. Why group leader/guitarist Peter Banks never bothered to replace Tony Kaye on keyboards after the first album is the head-scratcher here. Trying to do it all on guitar, Banks and band mates just can't seem to muster the musical depth to keep up with their prog-rock counterparts (although Banks' guitar work here is awesome, as usual). After this album, Banks retired Flash altogether and started a new band called Empire. They recorded three album's worth of material in the late '70s - none of which was ever released by a major label until just recently (on One Way)."
"Positive","Finally!: I did run out and buy this CD on June 29; in fact, I had the date marked on my calendar. I was especially anxious to get it, since I've yet to hear ""Get Born Again"" played on local radio (what's up with that, Houston?). I would have rated this CD five stars if there had been at least one more new song. But ""Get Born Again"" is definitely vintage Alice, and worth the purchase price for the CD, which also includes some CD-ROM stuff. I can't wait for the box set in the fall."
"Negative","Utterly frightening: The red-headed girl in this ""movie"" freaks me out man. She looks like she's about 9 years old, but acts like she's 30. I think I even saw her drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette. As for the movie itself...it stinks, don't waste your money like I did. If you have fond memories of it as a child, then don't try to re-live them by watching this 'cause it's just plain disturbing (especially when the boy gets a wig)."
"Positive","Intriguing Sci-Fi Story Captures Your Mind To The Last Word: In Evan's Voice, you meet Jake, a teen without a mother, Evan, Jake's plague stricken younger brother, Mrs. Garvey, a neighbor and docter, Jacob Adam, a mysterious storyteller with a different kind of story, and Mellie, Jake's best friend whose father wants her to marry a 'gizmo' for money. They all live in a plague-decimated Earth in the 21st century. Aside from the everyday problems of a street teen, Jake has to take care of Evan as he gets steadily sicker, and defend Mellie from her father. When he finds the storyteller for a school project, he suddenly sees a glimmer of hope that could make Evan better. This story keeps you enthralled to the last, making you yearn for more at the end of the story."
"Negative","They sent a completely different item!!: This vendor has a picture that does not match the item at all. The description does not match what was sent either!! They shipped out a ""Lexmark X2670"". They offered to replace the unit at their cost, but then they never said what unit they would be able to send. Then they had the nerve to be sarcastic about why our company would need a ""copier/scanner/fax"" that can function as a stand-alone.Would NOT recommend this vendor."
"Negative","Severely overpriced at $5.99: Let me be clear here: I did not have high expectations for a mandoline priced at about six bucks. Having said that, I did expect to be able to create reasonably simple cuts like french fries (if not superfine juliennes). But alas, it was not to happen: the blades and supports are so thin and flexible that getting even semi-even cuts is nearly impossible. Slices are noticably thicker on one end than the other, but the blade won't cut through a vegetable without a little pressure (which is what's warping the cuts).The hand-guard at least is better designed.In short, save your six bucks and either cut by hand or buy a real mandoline. This one will only frustrate you."
"Positive","Great Relaxing CD: I picked this CD up in a small record shop while on vacation in Santa Fe, New Mexico 5 years ago. The music is wonderful. Very peaceful and relaxing. Nice pan flute. I hope this group continues to make more CDs. I will get their other CD titled ""Turquoise Visions""."
"Negative","unimpressed: I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this item. The neck stretched out within the first two minutes and so the chicken won't fly. I'm a bit disappointed but I should have known they were low quality because of the price."
"Negative","One Lame Movie: The theme of this ~~film~~ is the foolish assumption that superior intelligence will confirm the ignorant and arrogant belief that GOD does not exist. While state of the art science clearly proves the impossibility of evolution, atheists desperately cling to the Darwinian fallacy. Ironically, if there was a personal contact with ``benign aliens`` who confirmed Divine Creation, the evolutionist would probably still attempt to justify his own misguided position. While there are ``billions and billions`` of stars in the universe, this failed film gets 1."
"Positive","Costa Rica: Excellent information. Very detailed in all aspects of living in Costa Rica. I can tell a lot of research and effort went into writing this book. I found it very helpful to me."
"Negative","Book fell apart: Within one hour of beginning a reading of this paperback book...""Lieutenant Gatewood""...the binding came unglued and the pages separated...very shoddy work by Bison Books as ordered through Amazon. Totally detracts from the ownership of this rare and valued history by an almost forgotten soldierwhere is the submit button?"
"Negative","An OK book that is out of date.: This was an OK book in it's time, but it is now completely out of date. This book covers InstallShield 5, which is not supported on Windows ME, Windows 2000, or Windows XP. Both InstallShild 6 and InstallShield Windows Installer Edition are different enought from InstallShield 5 to make this book obsolete."
"Positive","Highly underrated: Great little movie. I'm surprised it didn't get better reviews. Kids and adults liked it. Check it out, good addition to your movie library."
"Positive","Tyree's Tattoo Library: This book is really cool if you are not sure what type of tats to get. But I got for my son because he can draw and figured this could get him started on different designs and styles."
"Negative","Book is so small: The book is so small and hard to read. I'm disappointed in the size of the book. It's not big enough."
"Negative","An old gut's innocent mistake - not worth fighting about: At the time Amazon says that I purchased the Kindle Edition of the Wall Street Journal, I was completely unaware that I had done something to authorize this transaction. I am passed 75 and had not used my Kindle in almost a year because I find it difficult to remember how to do things.When I got a notice indicating that I was being charged $1.99, I could not figure out how to dispute the charge. Because it was only $1.99 I said forget it. I did not touch my Kindle again for several months.Incidentally, I never viewed the WSJ Kindle Edition."
"Positive","Quality product for the price: I bought the 94"" round cover. The Gardelle material appears to be quite durable. The ""quality"" vinyl cover I bought last fall tore in late January. At this time, this cover doesn't even show signs of straining at the seams. This winter has not been particularly rough in PA, but I like what I see (or don't see) so far. And since the price is comparable to (in some cases even less than) those of vinyl covers, I would highly recommend this product over vinyl.The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because it only has two straps to secure it to the chairs. Unfortunately, the elastic cord does not seem to keep the cover secure during high winds. It would be better if this particular size had six straps since it is designed for a six-chair table set. I spoke to Classic Accessories and was told that they are looking into adding more straps to their covers."
"Positive","Excellent Paper: This paper make great prints on my Epson 1800. If your going to bother printing yourself might as well use the best."
"Positive","A near-perfect book: Maximum recommendation for everyone interested in metal and/or occultism. This book does a wonderful job of illustrating the crossover between the impulses that drive people both into metal and into spiritually and energetically frustrated expressions of the occult urge in humanity. The appendices are highly valuable as well."
"Positive","Killing Time - Different but Enjoyable: I enjoyed this book. I salute Linda Howard for trying different types of story lines. Don't listen to the negative reviews. If you are a Linda Howard fan, read it and enjoy. I know you'll love the end. By the time I closed this book - I was very satified and had a smile on my face. I will never miss a Linda Howard book!Don't forget to read my very favorites - After the Night *******, Open Season ******, Shades of Twilight ******, Son of the Morning *********, Dream Man ******, Dying to Please *****."
"Negative","Don't be fooled: Re-written and expanded my left foot. The expanded part comprises of about 1 page of dialog and and additional scene. If you have the original story in the short story collection don't waste your $. The series is fabulous but this republished story was just a grab for more $."
"Positive","Fast delivery: Rack wouldn't revolve when I first opened the box, but my husband took it apart and oiled the little bearings and now it works fine. Very speedy delivery, thanks for the great service."
"Positive","shipping disappointing: This was shipped in an envelope and one of the brush packages was crushed open.Need to use something a little more substantial for shipping."
"Positive","Typical Affair: This was a novel of twists and secrets between a married man and the only love of his life. When Adam realizes he can't marry Natalie and must marry Julia thanks to his father's doings, he is devestated. This romance gets a little slow in some chapters but then it pumps up. It is a typical story of two people having an affair that must be kept classified, but, in the end, it will bang you with a surprise. It's worth the read."
"Positive","a good book: Definitely an enjoyable book that gives insight into the behind-the-scenes details of congressional politics. ""Showdown"" is a great book if you are interested in the nitty-gritty details of lobbying or Congress and Birnbaum and Murray provide a knack for detail (and humour) rarely found in today's books. Written in '86ish, and still a classic. A great supplement to ""The Power Game"" by Hedrick Smith."
"Negative","This book is worth purchasing, but was disappointing.: This book does give you a good historical lesson on Pale Ales. If you truly love Pale Ale, I do recommend this book; but it is quite factual and somewhat boring at times.As a homebrewer that brews extract beers, I was pleased that the book did offer extract recipes; however, the number of recipes was somewhat limited.I certainly do not mean any disrespect, but I was disappointed by the book's excessive use of exclamation marks. In my opinion, they give the book a sarcastic tone.However, if you enjoy Pale Ales as much as I do, relax, get this book, and have a homebrew."
"Negative","Absolutely horrendous!: My aunt sent me this book with a bunch of others she was getting rid of. After discovering that it was a book of retold fairy tales, I quickly began to read it. 5 pages later, however, I realized just why my aunt had gotten rid of it. It's awful! With all due respect to those who liked the book, it has absolutely no depth nor purpose. This book is a complete waste of time."
"Negative","the other reviews are over optimistic: The author does provide simple and light treatment of the basics, then plunges ahead with examples of his own circuit boards.It is not clear to me if any board will function with the same programs/examples.I hope there is a better text out there."
"Negative","Don't buy this!!: The product lasted for only about 5-6months. it has started giving issues & their support team just makes me go over the reset steps again and again without trying to understand that the product is not functioning properly."
"Positive","Wire Whip Dishwasher Trick: I still can't believe that Kitchen Aid can't produce a dishwasher safe wire whip! I'm now on my third whip because eventually I would forget and toss the whip into the DW. That causes the top attachment piece to oxidize, become covered in a black sooty-like substance and drip black water into my batter sometimes no matter how well I'd dried it previously. My ""so far so good"" trick: When I store my wire whip, I put a bright green clothes peg on it. When I take the whip out for use, the peg gets clipped on to the front of the upper rack of my DW. When I am hurrying through cleanup, the peg reminds me not to put the whip in the DW and I immediately turn and hand wash the whip. The clothes peg goes back on and into storage or into the mixer it goes, peg and all, Maybe it's a senior thing, but it sure works for me!!"
"Positive","WONDERFUL: I have been unable to find this Simple Lunch Box anywhere and I have been looking for one to replace the one I had! The ones I have seen are too big or too small for the containers I put in it to carry my lunch.THIS WAS PERFECT!!! And I was so happy with the color I choose!!!LOVE IT!!!"
"Positive","Good Game But very short: I am a big Zelda fan and when i found out Minish Cap was out, i was really excited. The Minish Cap is a great game that is just a very short. the Kinstone fusion adds to the value but in the end i beat the game in 3 days. The graphics are great, the sound is good but is not like the other games in the serious. the gameplay is good with the shrinking and the puzzles are at a good difficulty. The problem is that it is short. Buy this game"
"Negative","All copies should be sent back to the publisher for recycling: I have an extensive library with a large section on Rolls-Royce and Bentleys. This collection is often lent out. There are only a few books that I would never lend and this book is one of them. There are too many miss-identified photos, even if pretty, and text errors to list. In a reference book meant to teach its subject this is not acceptable. The many errors may be taken as truth by those not as familiar with the subject. Those who are familiar with the subject will be disappointed. I have many books written by Graham Robson and all of them are excellent and contain no errors, even minor ones. Did he actually write this thing? Who researched (and messed up) the photos? I bought a copy at great discount immediately after it was published and after reading it thought perhaps the book had been withdrawn. Unfortunately I was wrong."
"Positive","Works great: Price was right. I installed it, and after figuring out the timing of when to plug the phone into the PC, it worked great. I use Cingular, and have a Razor. I like it. Ring tones that I want, in a jiffy, and free."
"Negative","Release the product!!!!!!!!: I would like to give you a review. This game has been scheduled to be released with 5 different release dates. I don't believe we will see it this year."
"Negative","Not a bad premise: You know what, hiding behind all the cheesy special effects, bad acting, ludicrous action, and nuclear submarines, lies a not half-bad story about a man obsessed with confronting his nemesis, about the brutal and unconquerable strength of nature, about the force of the captain's personality in spite of his madness, about destiny and fate. Somebody ought to dump all the crap and stick with the story. Only, that name--Moby Dick? Seriously? That'll never work."
"Negative","Mission Computer Desk: This desk isn't adequately packaged for shipping. Just a few pieces of brown paper and styrophome corners with the desk pieces inside the box. The first time the desk was shipped to me, both of the legs were broken and the top had a corner smashed and a gouge in the center. When Target sent me a replacement desk, that one had broken legs also. A desk with no legs is worthless."
"Negative","Jabra Ear Gels: These are not the same that come on the earbud, and are not easy to use, or to hear from. I sent mine back!"
"Positive","Very good and easy, pro results.: I decided to try this tool since I frame a lot of photos and I make my own wood frames. I usually went to Michaels to buy custom mats. They are very expensive. A double mat (8 x 10) is more expensive than this tool alone. You can buy mat material on Amazon also which I did. So I am into it for just over $100.I just took this tool out of the package , read the easy instructions, and made my first mat in 15 minutes. Works great. This tool already paid for itself. If I make mats for three photos, that will cover the $100 cost which included the tool and 75 mats !Make sure you have a good straight edge and take your time. The instructions include diagrams which should be followed exactly."
"Negative","Better than Red Rabbit but not by much: not very realistic,comic book characters, plot is sketchy,and this book is just the prelude for a sequel. I wont't bore you with the plot; suffice to say the dust jacket is the book. With this book Clancy is continuing to show that he is past his prime and his books are lacking imagination. Wait for the paperback version."
"Negative","boring, condescending and just plain irritating!!: OH - I get it...slacker is tongue-in-cheek for ""Oh Muffy, you're doing a GREAT job"" UGH -- give me a break. I don't really know any moms who read parenting books. I guess the world is full of them and they are all judging me. hm - I say ""Who cares?""...We all do the best we can. This borrowed (thank goodness) book infuriated me and I didn't crack a smile once. More of a biography of her family and home life. She didn't really talk about parenting all that much - just herself. I recommend Erma Bombeck (like others have said) or David Sedaris for a REAL humorous look at life."
"Negative","Spectra-Garbage: Do NOT buy this toy. An adult cannot even achieve success with this hard to manipulate toy. You can use a plastic stylus to move the mini-lightbulbs to the color of choice, but it doesn't work well. Or, you can use your hand in an attempt to achieve the same aim. This method irritates the skin in no time (possibly for a child needing more sensory feedback, this feature might be of value). Even when one tries to draw a row of colors all the same, the slightest pressure in the wrong direction renders your efforts futile. The packaging dishonestyly beats the drum for the simplicity of this toy. After playing with it, most people are disappointed in what they can produce. If I could get my money back for this toy, I would."
"Positive","MADE IN HEAVEN: I wonder why this film under rated all this time, of course this is not an A class film, but the cast was just fit, especially the cameo. Anyway, I hope this will on the blu-ray market very soon and satisfy for all who love this movie."
"Positive","This was recommended to me by a mechanic friend.: I first learned of this tool from a friend that's a mechanic. So, when I was working on a car where I thought this would come in handy (2000 VW New Beetle) on, I bought it.It made life SOO much easier. Although I've only used it one time on one car, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again. I think it's a good tool to have around the shop!"
"Positive","Liked it, but thought it would be better: This documentary was good but I thought it would be better. I may have had too high of expectations, however, since I had been eagerly anticipating seeing it. It is an excellent testament to the power of tapping and do recommend seeing it. Just don't expect in-depth story lines of the participants or high quality footage."
"Negative","The Show is Merely OK: Some of the bits are funny, but I just can't simply love this show no matter what. It relies far too much on beer drinking, farting and burping - and doesn't have the heart of The Simpons or the wit of King of the Hill. It tries to be witty by splicing in several references to 70's and 80's pop culture but these always feel forced and trivial. Many of the characters are plain annoying (Peter and Chris) while others are under-developed (Meg). Stewie is fairly funny but he's kind of a one note song (does the same things over and over and uses the same lines in every episode like 'what the deuce!'..funny the first time but repetitive very quickly). Brian the Dog can be VERY funny and simply needs more screentime as the Griffin Family's alcoholic pooch. 2 stars for some moments of levity."
"Negative","Bob Dylan : The Karaoke Version: I suppose my title tells it all. While I would go the distance to purchase a new Dylan item to listen to - this live recording at Budkoan leaves me nauseous. I am left wondering what Dylan and/or his promoters, were thinking about when they came up with this musical format. The 'up tempo' musical background coupled with Dylan's attempt to join in by adding his own uptemp vocal elements put simply, destroys the poetry of his songs! This is one live concert to be avoided - even by the collector!!!"
"Positive","Entertaining Documentary on French & Indian War: This documentary was very well done and gave real insight into the beginning of the French and Indian War. It is refreshing to see that this struggle for the possession of the North American continent is finally getting the coverage that it deserves. I would highly recommend this film both for the novice and the serious student of this often overlooked period of American History. I can't wait for the next installment!"
"Positive","Simply Beautiful: In the past, I was hesitate to purchase Barbie dolls for my daughter. However the new sense of diversity with the addition of a variety of skin tones has change my view. Thanks for giving my daughter a doll that favors her."
"Negative","Has it's moments but not overall great ..more focuses on the younger audiences and was not funny: Well this is no Shrek, Findidn Nemo oh wait it's not like most animated films oh wait it is better then Shark's Tale. I found this film to focus more to the younger ages and focuses to much on the naimation and the voces and not on the story. The movie is about Marty the Zebra (voiced by Chris Rock) pampered friends Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer). David Schwimmer is the only thing good about the film, Jada Pinkett Smith seems lost and the rest are ok. Overall not that much jokes make the film slow and not intersesting."
"Negative","What is all the hype about?: This book is selling like crazy and all of my friends had read it and absolutely loved it, so I decided to read it too, just to see what all the hype was about. I must say I was pretty disappointed. I read the whole book in about an hour or two, and I got nothing out of it, the whole plot is pretty lame in general. It just seemed to lack the depth and [true to teen life] perspective that other popular teen books have these days. Some people liked the poem format, but I for one found it just annoying and distracting. It took away from the plot in my opinion. In general, the book seemed like a waste of time."
"Negative","Who did the music?: At best this is a bad B-movie remake of Hardcore.But who did the music? the credits only list two peices, neither one of which apppears to be the arabic music all thru the film."
"Negative","good music, but with too much background noise: good music, but with too much background noise. Her the Italian version is recorded, that important message should be shown on the cover. Thids version is not dull, but there is adifference with the french version (next to the language)."
"Negative","Worked fine until cleaned: Out of the box the product worked well for a few weeks.When our cleaning lady inadvertantly washed it with whatever cleaner she was using to clean the shower the mirror surface lost its ""magic"" -- now it fogs up quickly. Running a stream of hot water over the surface give momentary utility.Sure would like to know what to do to rejuvinate the surface and make it work again."
"Positive","Great!: My 10 year old daughter chose this book, and she loves it! The author's review is very accurate. Kids of different skill levels of drawing will enjoy this book and get a lot out of it. Mine is not an artistically ""gifted"" child - but she is happy with her new ability to make her drawings look like horses! Children who love to draw and will spend a lot of time on a drawing will appreciate ALL the wonderful tips and hints to draw and style the horses. The format is friendly - and even if she doesn't ""do"" all the details herself (the different braided manes, pairings of horses etc) mine LOVES looking at the pictures and having the simple and clear explanations. Highly reccomended!"
"Negative","Kindle copy full of typos and punctuation errors: Although the plot and characters were carefully crafted, Simon and Schuster did a lousy job of editing, I have never read a published work that had so many punctuation and spelling errors. As an author myself I would be horrified to have anyone purchase an e-book of mine with with this many errors."
"Positive","He's Baaack!: YES! Dylan's back and better than ever. This CD is loaded with great songs. I listened it through 5 times in a row the first time I put it on. The man is back."
"Negative","What a joke!: I'm a huge fan of zombie movies, so when I saw this in Wal-Mart (on sale for only $9.00)...I figured I'd give it a chance. Bad idea. Not only did this movie have a ton of holes in the plot and continuity issues, it looks like it was filmed with a home video camera. It's seriously bad. No redeeming qualities whatsoever...except for the fact that you'll probably get a few good laughs out of it. The acting is terrible, the effects are pretty ridiculous, and it's so cliche it'll make you sick. Avoid at all costs!"
"Positive","Very nice, not great: I live in a smallish downtown condo so this center channel speaker serves my room size well; as well as using my Onkyo SR605 7.1 receiver. Would highly recommend for a small space."
"Negative","horrible: It broke within 4 hours of having it...I was so mad that I did not want to send it back for a new one. There is no point of getting one from here. I was walking with the bottle and it dropped out of my hand, 3 feet down to the CARPET floor. The bottom exploded and shattered. I thought these bottles were supposed to last long...this has been the 2nd bottle I have had that has broken because of falling to the ground."
"Positive","awesome: because of you is one of the best dance/pop/freestyle songs of all time the musical production and sweet melodies in their simpilcity still give me the chills today. Show Me is sweet too with a cute video."
"Negative","beware Canon users: I used to love this program but not anymore. I was advised by Surething to purchase the upgrade from version 3 to 4 and this would enable me to use it with a Canon i865 printer for direct CD printing. When I took the plunge I ended up having to download an update from special programmer who had done some sort of template. The template does not work very well and you still have to set it up to a degree. For some reason Surething wont support Canon printers. They have lots of template's for Epsons but no Canons. This of course is only a problem if you want to print direct to CD so if your printing onto paper labels there is no problem doing it that way."
"Negative","Worst Movie in years!!: This is just pethetic! I don't get the point of watching the movie. There was abot hmm... 2..3 funny parts that don't EVEN GO WITH THE MOVIE! Even my dad fell asleep in the movie. I should'nt even tell you the stroy. It's so STUPID! DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE WHEN IT COMES OUT! IF you buy, I hope you enjoy being bored."
"Negative","Dont waste your time: why anybody rated this film more than one or two stars is beyond me. It is a slow, boring, generic film that put me to sleep. One of the worst movies I HAVE EVER SEEN!"
"Positive","The Matrix FoReVeR: I'm a big real big fan of the Matrix. I'm 12 year's old and i'm a female. I think this movie is better than all the matrix 1 & 2. The first movie had a sense if I was really in a computer world control by machines. The second was a little better than the first. It had an other sense of Neo being in control of the matrix until Mr. Smith showed up.The third movie is more intense with lots action. It had all tight graphics. I really like the special efects that made this movie possible. It's to bad that this last part gave away A best ending to the trilogy of the Matrix. I hope no one ever but I mean ever comes up with a movie as good as the MATRIX TrILLoGy. MATRIX FoReVeR"
"Positive","Great card good price: The card meets my expectations for providing Firewire to my PC for capturing video from my video camera."
"Positive","Fabulous book!!!!!: My daughter, who is 6, sometimes has a hard time keeping her attention focused on chapter books. She loved this one so much we plowed through 9 of the 12 chapters in one night and she was begging to finish it the next night. Thanks, Mr. King-Smith!!!!"
"Positive","AWESOME!!!: This book is crazy awesome! It has all the information that one would ever need about geography. Everything from basic facts to unique details about an assortment of countries is neatly compiled into an easy to use guide. Anyone remotely intersted in geography should buy this book. Also anyone that needs to know anything about geopgraphy for a class or report should buy this book. It is worth much more than it costs!"
"Negative","Great Cable, Better & Cheaper Alternatives: I purchased three of these for my triple monitor gaming setup, and I am thrilled with the build quality. Very Solid, even stylish. Picture quality is what I would expect from a HDMI/DVI cable.A couple weeks later I purchased the same type of cable from Monoprice for use on my another triple monitor setup at my office. I found them to not only have a better build quality, and even a smaller guage wire (remember, smaller gauge = increased cable radius, thus better signal). The picture and video quality of the two cables were indistinguishable. The best part is the MP cables are a third the price (and even sold on Amazon). So for better build quality, same image quality, and cheaper price, I'd recommend the MonoPrice Premium HDMI/DVI cable over this one."
"Negative","Disapointing: Should have been called disappointment, BDP is no PE. KRS1's `knowledge' is really no more than Nation Of Islam rhetoric, not so cleverly put to music. KRS1 was always more `preacher' than `teacher', inviting obedience rather than introspection. Here, in `Ya Strugglin' he adds homophobia to his cannon of hates."
"Negative","Not brand new, when they said it was new.: The book (that was purchased) wasn't in the condition stated by the seller. I could have bought a better book with the price I paid for this book."
"Negative","This is not a book!: If you are a expecting a book with information this is not the product for you. However, if you are expecting a disc with many NCLEX style questions this product could be useful. I was wanting a review type book to augment my maternal-neonatal nursing class. I plan on keeping this product for future NCLEX review but it is not helpful for the typical student."
"Negative","Skip this book and go to Knit Lit Two: I read Knit Lit two first and loved it. The stories were funny and touching and varied. I laughed outloud at some and cried with others. So I bought the first one, Book Lit, and was very disappointed. Start with Book Lit Two, skip this one."
"Negative","Didn't work for me.: I didn't like this product at all. It didn't work for me. It has a very thick consistency and it didn't have any slip. My hair felt dry after I washed the conditioner out. I was not happy that I bought it. I don't know if the reason is that the conditioner states that it is for damaged hair and that wasn't my condition of my hair."
"Positive","The Endless Summer: I received the DVD in record time...my surfing son was thrilled with the movie and I with the reminder."
"Positive","A Very Fresh Interpretation of These Concertos.: This recording showcases these Haydn Cello Concertos in a way I have not heard before. Ms. Dillingham's playing is strong, yet nuanced and sensitive. She brings a remarkable sense of atmosphere to these beautiful pieces. The Moscow Chamber Orchestra is also excellent, as is the sound quality of the CD."
"Positive","I thaught it was great: I read the other reviews.I guess I'm the only person that liked Chill Factor.OR the other reviewers just didn't know what the heck they were talking about.Personally i think it's the ""OR"" myself.Also they talk about how bad the acting is?Cuba was perfect.So was Skeet.Plot.Good.The bad dude(Brynner) becomes the skape goat for the U.S. military when a test of a bio weapon(Code named Elvis) go's wrong and kills 8 people.Brynner gets sent to prison for 10 years When he gets out he seeks revenge on the doc that was in charge of the opperation and the U.S. Government as well.One thing leads to another and Cuba and Skeet get a hold of Elvis and have to get it to an army base before the bad guys get it.I think that a little bit more could have been done with the plot myself.Like the bad guys frame Cuba and Skeet for taking Elvis and they have to prove otherwise.That would rock!But thats not the direction they went in.The directing was perfect.SFX was perfect. Casting.Perfect."
"Positive","Stereotipical King, yet still creepy: 'Secret Window' definitely had me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. It is filled with suspense and crazy plot turns. However, I found it to be rather cliche, in the sense that it was a total stereotype of a Steven King novel, even though that is what it was based upon. Or maybe not a stereotipical King plot, but almost a cliche 'scarey movie' line, where it's just an easy escape to have the main character be, well, crazy.Despite these vices, 'Secret Window' was still a rather good thriller, and I would recommend it, most definitely. Johnny Depp shines, as usual, and I've never seen him in such a creepy role.Overall: four stars!"
"Positive","Funny Show: I bought this for my dad who is currently bored at home on disability. He used to always watch this when I was a kid so now it's keeping him entertained once again."
"Negative","disgusting: this is just low down dirty dog doo doo. it is a very icky poo poo album. it made me feel sad when i baught it, then listened to it. :( and it had naughty words in it and got me introuble with my mommy. your pal,"
"Negative","Ripped OFF!: Before buying this book second hand, there should be a warning, that you will not be able to use code found on the inside of the paper cover to take the strengths finder profile online. I feel that I spent money for nothing and ripped off! I feel used! There is also no information on how to be able to go online and pay to take the profile. If you buy a second hand book, and find a way to pay to take the profile online, you will probably have spent more than if you had bought a brand new book."
"Positive","Great cuticle remover: Decided to start doing my own manicures/pedicures versus having them done at a salon. This cuticle remover works pretty well and makes my manicures and pedicures much easier; with better results. I presoak before applying which seems to do the trick"
"Negative","PASS ON THIS TERRIBLE DVD!: I'm an avid fan of Nina Simone so I was looking forward to this DVD...But seeing her sweat profusely throughout the show & even complain that's it's way too hot makes this disappointing & disheartening. They should have never released this DVD especially with the artist looking soaked & uncomfortable which is a real travesty. Don't waste your time with this dog! Instead get her best available DVD to date Nina Simone Live At Montreux 1976."
"Positive","Great DVD that was a long time coming: Prior to purchasing this DVD, I heard many things about Forrest Yoga. All of it good. I bought the DVD and was initially not impressed with the poses I saw performed. Then I actually tried the workout and it was great. The poses performed on this DVD aren't anything a person with 2 or more years of experience could not perform. With that said, what makes this DVD solid, is the amount of time poses are held and the core abdominal work. For people who are used to vinyasa flow constant movement type yoga (like myself), this DVD is a nice alternative. Forrest Yoga is slower flowing yoga (compared to Ashtanga or Vinyasa Flow/Power Yoga) with more of an emphasis on holding poses for a longer period of time. I look forward to purchasing more of Ana's DVDs."
"Negative","JUST LOOKS GOOD--THAT'S IT...: I BOUGHT THIS GARBAGE FOR MY SON DURING CHRISTMAS---AND LIKE THE OTHER MOSSIMO WATCH I HAD THAT BROKE--SAME HAPPEN...IN THE GARBAGE...AVOID MOSSIMO--YOU PAY WHAT YOU GET FOR.....DON'T WASTE YOUR GAS MONEY.."
"Positive","Well designed, extremely easy to install: I just replaced a Moen that was only 5 years old but rusted out. The Moen was difficult to install. This faucet was very easy to install. All the parts seem much more rugged and are primarily made of brass."
"Positive","Why the hate?: I just bought this album yesterday and I can't stop listening to it. Ruben deserve to win on American Idol, and I think it's ludicrous to compare him to Clay Aiken. They are TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE with TWO DIFFERENT STYLES of music. And not only that, they are friends. So to all the people that are hating, GET A LIFE!!"
"Negative","Right out of the Middle Ages: If you are a very severe fundamentalist Orthodox Jew, you might like it. I didn't care for all the hate propaganda, stonings and whiplashing recommended for those who break minor commandments. I found it hard to believe that G-d would like it, either. The choice is, of course, yours."
"Negative","Nightmare customer support: I bought software and on disc. The disc didn't arrive, so I contacted the company. Short version: after three months, it hadn't arrived and I asked for a refund. They wouldn't give me a refund and, instead, offered me free downloads of several of their other products.I had numerous problems with the installation of the download version. After several emails to the company, the download version still wouldn't run. Still no refund. Still no copy in the box.I agree with the other reviews that this product has problems, especially there product support. And there response time was not very quick. I don't recommend this product."
"Negative","why do great bands feel they have to change?: I have to agree with the several reviews listed above that state that the first two albums were great! and this one falls FLAT. Why can't a great band stick with the tried and true. This reminds me of Gene Simmons trying his hand at acting !, he soon found out that what he was really good at and what paid the bills was playing a bass shaped like an axe and spitting fake blood. Well the NMAS first two albums had blood and guts and one hell of a good unique sound. This offering, well, not so good. If they keep this up they will take thier place with Kenny Wayne and Jonny Lang. You may not think that such a bad place to be, but dang those first two albums were good!!!. I think the high priced producers must have gotten envolved."
"Positive","An Amazing A/V Manager!: This receiver has awesome functionality with any brand of TV, satellite/cable, DVD, BD, etc. It can be programmed to turn on and shut off with the TV, and its THREE HDMI inputs turn it into an awesome TV input selector switch, allowing you to have hi-def sat/cable, DVD w/upconversion or BD, and a game system (or BD). This thing has it all. And the 7.1Ch sound makes for an immersive viewing experience! Buy this receiver - it is well worth the money!"
"Positive","I'm in love!!!: I have had my Nikon D100 for many years with a wide angle and a telephoto lens. I was looking to sell it or replace it, I just didn't like it much. NOW, this lens has made me fall in love again with my camera. It is fantastic and takes beautiful pictures. I love this lens!"
"Positive","The Fearless Man: One review of this book reads that it does not allow the reader to see and feel what is going on in the combat scenes. I accept that the reviewer felt that. I do agree that the combat scenes get down to basic details that at times become almost too detailed to understand with their stream of data. I disagree with the judgement that this book didn't allow the reader to ""see and feel"". I could see, hear, smell and feel the combat. Admittedly, I was a Marine Corps officer and trained to understand the writer's language. I was struck by the attention to and accuracy of details. If troops moved south on a particular compass heading the written heading was correct. I highly recommend this book. The characters are displayed warts and all in a story that could only have been written by someone who had been there"
"Negative","Mediocre at best: Happy Hooker is neither a book about a hooker or how to crochet. This is less than mediocre - try Vogue Knitting on the Go: Crochet Basics (Vogue Knitting On The Go)."
"Negative","ignore this, see the original instead: My theory is that Ole Bornedal, whose 1994 Danish-language original ""Nattevagten"" was an instant classic of the serial-killer/suspense genre, was shown a large sum of $$$ to force out this turgid, soulless remake. It's almost a shot-by-shot, line-by-line retelling of the familiar 'whodunit' with a law student (the uncomfortable Ewan McGregor) being menaced by a serial killer during his nightwatch at a medical building. The character shading, smooth flow of events, and atmospheric chills have been replaced at the expense of visual finesse and inexplicable character motivation. Style over substance, much in the vein of those melarkey ""Scream"" films, and more than likely to snare in the kiddies.My two-star rating is based solely on the stylish re-creations of a few scenes, plus admirable performances from Nick Nolte and Josh Brolin, who give the dense material their all. But my advice is to avoid this version altogether and stick with the real deal."
"Positive","Finally!!!!!!!: This DVD allows me 20 min to get dinner ready, or do my makeup, or clean the kitchen. My daughter LOVES it. We have had to cut her down to just twice a day because she wants to watch all the time. She is 18-months old and follows the dance instruction and copies the children on the screen. She even will repeat phrases like ""touch toes"" or ""fall down"". Awesome!"
"Positive","Great resource for COM/COM+ with .Net: I have to agree with Chung Yeung Choi's review. Look at Advanced .Net Remoting by Ingo Rammer for a good review of .Net Remoting, but for COM+/Enterprise Services, I have yet to see a better treatment! It may be because that is what my focus is these days (rather than .Net Remoting), but it really helped me get up to speed quickly on the issues/problems/advantages (he points to all of these -- excellent coverage!) of Enterprise Services."
"Positive","ONE IN A MILLION: Rolf Gates' book is the kind of blessing that only comes around with the regularity of Haley's Comet. By his blending of quotes, personal experience, and yoga instruction, he accomplishes something of serene wonder. His book conveys the very heart of yoga, for it reaches the reader on a level beyond words, phrases, or didactics. Using the book as a daily inspirational guide, the seeker can find and find abundantly."
"Negative","NOT the extended version of the movie: I pre-ordered both the ultimate editions of Harry Potter movies 3 and 4 believing they would be the extended versions like movies 1 and 2. They are NOT the extended versions. Why they give the extended version for 1 and 2, but not 3 and 4 is beyond me. Almost seems like a trick with 1 and 2 to get you to buy 3 and 4.No matter what the reason, bad show WB for treating your customers this way.I only hope I can still return them after I broke the seal wrapping.If you want the extended versions --- do NOT buy these, you will only get the original version."
"Negative","Read This Before You Read The Book: I thought this was a self-help book. I got into the book believing that I was going to come out with something, a self renewal, an awakening, knowing that I wasn't the only one that has gone through the things the main character is going through,... What a disappointment!... What she doesn't realize is how many unsuspecting woman are going to be fuming when they get to the end of this book. The character Nora is a connieving liar, and why the author just didn't write the book revolving around her I don't know? Why did she have to get us involved in believing that at the end of the book not only I, but anyone who reads this book would have a new outlook, to realize that you can't believe her or the book from the beginning to the end...."
"Positive","Jump N Carry does the job well: I have a John Deere that needs to be jumped started each time it needs to be started. I sometimes jump start my tractor about 15 times in a day. I do charge the unit after the end of the day so I don't know how long it could jump between charges, but in two years, I have never had a problem. I also need to inflate my tractor tires which it does fine. Sure, a bit slow, but that is being picky. I am able to pump up my truck tires also. I have had this unit for two years and am very happy with it.If I were to make improvments, I would add longer jump cables, a better mount for the tire inflator. I would also add a light made of LED that could illuminate the area. This unit does the job you need it to do if all you want is to jump and inflate. I did buy a new different unit that has an inverter for AC, has DC plugs, inflates, jumps and has a light. the Jump N Carry is lighter and easy enough for my wife to handle with ease while my newer inverter is quite a bit heavier."
"Negative","Banal, hackneyed, and arrogant: It doesn't take an undergraduate degree in physics for us to predict the implications of the genetic revolution as set out in this book. For a much more cogent and beautifully written tract, I highly recommend Robert Pollack's Signs of Life: Exploring the Language and Meanings of DNA."
"Positive","Twisted Metal 3 is a great PS1 game for all: Twisted Metal 3 is a game I played for a very long time back in the day. It has a great soundtrack, quite a few levels, many characters, and unique enviroments. I deffinately reccomend this game to anyone who plays video games, new or seasoned.-willh09"
"Negative","Great Concept but poor heating: After much contemplation, I bought one of these and used it one night and basically had to hug it to feel any heat. I like the fact that the setup was easy and it is a very nice looking heater but it really didn't put out enough heat to keep me warm from 2-3 feet away. After I brought this home feeling very proud of my purchase, the first thing my wife says is that it's too low for the kids...duh! I didn't even think of that.I give this item only 2 stars because it does everything except what it's supposed to do.I returned it the following day citing ""disappointment with the heat output""."
"Positive","My Daughter Loved it!: My 8-year-old usually needs a lot of prompting to finish a book. She absolutely loved this one and read it without any urging. She can't wait for them to write more as she as read both available now."
"Negative","HUGELY DISAPPOINTED: I was so excited when I heard that there was a new Nickelback DVD being released in September, and shocked that no one had it in stock on the release date -- they had just played locally to a sold-out crowd and were AMAZING. I also couldn't figure out why there was NOTHING about it on their website. Guess I should have seen the writing on the wall. Why did no one have it in stock? BECAUSE IT'S HORRIBLE!I managed to steer clear of buying ""Unauthorized: This Side Up"" (released in 2002) and ""Road To Success"" (released in 2004) after reading reviews. I honestly believe that it is THE EXACT SAME FOOTAGE USED IN ALL THREE VIDEOS. I couldn't believe that on the cover it actually says, in large letters, ""An Authorized Biography"" and on the back it says ""A Unauthorized Biography (sic)""Well, in three tries they finally duped me, but it won't happen again. My advice: Don't buy ANYTHING unless it is listed on the band's website."
"Positive","Logitech cordless mouse: This is by far my favorite mouse. I've used this model on three computers and it becomes intuitive after a while."
"Positive","It's a mouspad: It's a basic mousepad. It has a nice squishy feel, it stays nicely in place on my desk, its looks aren't distracting and my laser mouse works very well on it. It's a great price if you get the super saver shipping.As to the smell, I believe it smells like a mousepad, which I don't really mind. I haven't noticed a smell while sitting at my desk, though the first two days I used it I noticed a rubbery smell on my hand after using it. It washed off easily though. I think the smell goes away after a few days.My recommendation: this is the mousepad to buy unless you have a strong aversion to the smell of rubber."
"Positive","Bought it for a class.: Satisfied because I learned through this book for my class. Would recommend for beginners and students who are taking a pre-calculus class."
"Negative","Just oh so sad...: This book sux donkey balls. If I wanted to read a book full of assumptions, I'd read the Bible. Check out http://maddox.xmission.com for more info. And to think that O'Reilly was born in the U.S....let alone in the 20th century."
"Negative","Made in china, bad quality , defecteive shoe that was not inspected: The left shoe deflates air like balloon with the sound and the feel of stepping on leaking balloon with every step. This product was not inspected, I hate buying a made in china product, half of the quality I'm used to from Clark's.There is something to be said about buying shoes from a store as I would not have bought them if I tried them on."
"Positive","good for a debut: This is one of the best LPs to come out of Death Row Records. Produced by Dr. Dre, it has about 13 tracks (plus 5 skits). The singles include: Gin & Juice, Murder Was The Case, & Who Am I (Whats My Name); all which are huge hits. I give this record 4/5. If you like old school gangsta rap, this is for you (especially if you liked Dr. Dre's ""The Chronic""."
"Positive","Green Latern DVD: Well, the product, the DVD is fine. We have not tried the online copy. The movie is very entertaining. It helps (me) a lot that I have a comic book / superhero lover watching all of these superhero movies with me because he explains a lot that sometimes gets skipped over in the movies."
"Positive","Nice Update to Classic Christian Songs: I grew up with Maranatha music and have many of the albums (on vinyl). This CD contains updated versions of many classic songs. They are very well done and easy to listen to."
"Negative","The horrors of copy protection!: I was extremely pissed off when I saw that ""content protected"" logo on the CD. I traditionally rip all my CDs into iTunes to play on my iPod. I don't buy digital albums because they can be lost in the event that my computer crashes. I predict this CD will flop, because it doesn't enable rock fans to make legit copies as they desire. Copy protection is evil and vile, and the record label should be ashamed of itself."
"Positive","Cryoderm Roll-on: I chose this item because I have used it before and it is a wonderful temporary pain reliever for sore muscles and the aroma is pleasant also. The price was right too."
"Negative","I never got this!: I really wanted to read this. First had issues with download, then paid for paperback. Still haven't got 3 weeks later."
"Positive","WOW: The first time I heard ""Silent Legacy"" I cried like a baby. Melissa Ethridge was singing what I had been living. Bless you Melissa. You are wonderful. No song I EVER heard touched me like this"
"Positive","KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: With a great cast and an enemy you just love to hate this one just keeps on ticking. Kirk and his old enemy Khan butt heads over a device that can create planets called ""Genesis"". The only part I didn't like was when Dr. McCoy got all religious about the creation of planets. I know that he is a country doctor and that this is the point, but I just don't think it adds to the character. I only write this review knowing that if you don't know this already you are not a Star Trek fan. If this is the case I urge you to reconsider this movie is wonderful strictly for its entertainment value."
"Positive","PERFECT VIDEO!!: I have tried quite a few Pilates Video for something to fill me in at home when I cant make class. This is a great Beg/ Int. one.It is a perfect mix of Toning & Pilates. The 50 min goes by fast working EVERYTHING or you can break it up into 10 min of what you want to concentrate on. It is new too so you don't feel like your doing an 80s jazzercise. Susan is sweet too. I'd highly recommend :)"
"Positive","Classic: There's nothing bad to say about this book! Everyone should read it before they die. Great, entertaining book for anyone."
"Positive","The American Dream: Unlike other economic books Barbara Ehrenreich tells us the truth behind the American Dream through her book ""Nickel and Dimed: On (not) getting by in America. Taking on odd, minimum wage jobs she shows us how difficult it is for one to survive in America on a minimum waged salary. She tell us the truth that no one seems to have the guts to tell us. This book is highly recommended to those who want to inform themselves on how our economy really functions."
"Negative","Good price if it fits you, but that is iffy: There is a reason this mitt is relatively cheap. The shape of it is very strange. It does not fit my hands at all. I have fairly wide hands and this mitt feels very ackward. It is tight to get into and the thumb is too short. I would return it except the postage would cost me more than the mitt did. I would suggest you buy in person someplace where you can put your hands in it first."
"Positive","Absolutely Awesome!: ""Blue Country Heart"" is absolutely outstanding! A great collection of musicians producing an awesome piece of work. In my humble opinion, Jorma's music was made for this combination of instruments. For it's great selection of songs and magic blend of strings and vocal harmonies, ""Blue Country Heart"" deserves to win a grammy, no questions asked.Jorma, thank you. ""Blue Country Heart"" is a wonderful gift and this particular fan couldn't be more grateful. Keep it coming!"
"Negative","almost a one star: I can't give this book an one star like I'd like to only because I finished it. You see, if it was truly awful I would not have got to the end at all. The only saving grace for me was the descriptions of the exotic lands this book took me to, Algeria and the Sahara Desert especially. The descriptions were much better than the story. Heck, the more I think of it, if I wanted descriptions of settings, I could have read a tour guide and have been entertained. I have changed my mind, I will rate it one star after all."
"Positive","Works great: Makes this nearly 100 lbs planer feel like I am moving almost nothing. Very nice base. Easy to put together. Only negative is that the directions for changing the pivot wheel mount from an outside mount to an inside mount could have been better. Other than some minor head scratching, it took less than an hour to put it together and start making saw dust."
"Negative","Microsoft doesn't support their own products!: I've been burned by Microsoft twice before with Sidewinder joysticks. The first time I bought one was when I had Windows 98. It was a Sidewinder Pro. Great joystick, plug n play, all that. When I migrated to Windows 2000, I found that the Sidewinder Pro was not supported (despite being analog--you'd think it would be easy to program drivers for it). I thought, ""Okay, maybe there are problems, blah blah blah."" I then bought a Sidewinder Force Feedback Pro, again, great product, plug n play, all that. Worked great. When I migrated again to Windows XP I found AGAIN it wasn't supported by Microsoft. There is NO reason why a company such as Microsoft cannot support their own products on their own operating system. I will NEVER buy a Sidewinder again. I can't trust them. Buy anything else. I've had great luck with the Wingman Digital Extreme--$$$ at ......--excellent buy!"
"Negative","inside the third world: i think this book is awful. please send me some information on it. i read it, but it was so confusing and had so many numbers and stuff, i didnt understand it at all. it would be so greatly appreciated if you could send me a summary of the book, that could help me in writing a 4 page report.thank you, jojo evanick"
"Negative","I STILL Have not gotten them!!: i WROTE AND EMAILED BLAH BLAH SAID THEY WHERE HERE LAST WEEK HAVE YET TO GET THIS ORDER! wth SAVE YOUR MONEY GO TO WALMART WHERE YOU PICK IT OUT WITH YOUR OWN HANDS!"
"Positive","Canon Mini Tripod 7 is a ""STAR""!: I needed someone to hold my camera one day and I was the only someone there. Lost the shot. I searched and found this little gem. Sturdy, well constructed and small as can be. I carry it in my ""go"" bag and never notice it 'till I need it. It's there. Easy, fast and reliable. Great purchase!!! I wish everything I bought worked for me this well!"
"Negative","Bad movie, hot girl.: The only redeeming qualities of this movie is Catherine Zeta Jones' stunning face/body and some nice scenery. The scenes of the heist in Kuala Lampur as well as the Scottish castle scenes had some incredibly picturesque backgrounds. However, the plot is convoluted to the point where the ""tense"" moments lack suspense because the viewer is too confused to figure out what is going on. The director attempts to bombard the audience with plot twists but there are too many twists and turns that don't really seem to make any sense. The age difference between Connery and Jones detracts from the believability of their romance. If you're looking for a movie about a heist, go with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo in the Thomas Crown Affair."
"Negative","A Tour Album: This was very dissapointing. I expected a reality based novel, but it turned out to be a highly expanded tour book of sorts for the USN Submariners. A forced attempt at dropping as many names as possible so that they may take their due place on stage. Obvious bait for Hollywood.Lacks depth or any serious literary skill. Feels like one long newspaper interview. Especially lacking was mention of the moral aspects of having one's finger on the trigger of a doom's day machine. Hard to believe this never occupied any of the thoughts of the men and women manning these marvels of technology and dispensers of indiscriminant destruction. So little mention was actually made of the real hero that enabled these brave men to navigate with such ease in the endless oceans of our planet: 20th Century science and engineering."
"Positive","Amazing and 10x better in High-Def!!: A truly amazing series!! I don't quite buy into the, 'look how fragile it is, we're going to kill it' angle but it's still amazing. To me, it shows how truly resilient our planet is and how insignificant we really are in the scheme of things. They do seem to keep the propoganda at a minimum which is also a plus!This is a high-def must-have. The shots are amazing, the quality is awesome. There are even little story lines throughout each one as they follow an animal or an animal family!"
"Positive","work as expected: These light bulbs work as expected and are just about as bright as the OEM ones that came in the car."
"Negative","Poor Quality: This movie is very poor quality. Dots and spots all over the screen, the picture goes out. Terrible."
"Positive","Solid, nice and elegant feeling glass: I'm not by any means a crystal expert, but I knew that I wanted a set of nice wine glasses that were thin, well proportioned and had a stem, but weren't as expensive as Reidel. These fit the bill. The price is great - about $11/stem, and the quality is rather decent. Perhaps not quite up to the Reidel standard (one of my stems is a tad wobbly) but you can't beat the quality for the price. I really like the shape of the Atelier style too. They have some personality. I debated between these and the Spiegelau vino vino glasses.I ordered one set of four as a tester and am going to order 4 more of the cab/merlot glasses plus 8 of the reisling glasses. And if they break, which they inevitably will because I tend to drop things, it won't be the end of the world. What more can you ask for? And the packaging was great. They arrived fast and in perfect condition."
"Negative","no bubbles: bought these last year. when they came, i discovered that at least one in each box had no liquid in the bubble mast. very disappointing!"
"Negative","Awful: I was told this CD was more along the lines of Enigma. It's cinema music....not Enigma.Helmut Vonlicten is a guy named Jeff.Franz Vonlicten is a guy named Rob. They are brothers and they do not permit any pictures of themselves as the Vonlichtens which in my opinion is the most stupidest thing ever - it carries over into their music their ridiculous ego trip.Buy this CD and you're feeding into their incredible higher than higher ego."
"Positive","Melts in 80 degree weather: I like this for my spin class it helped a bit of the pain in my butt.it was ruined when i left my gym bag in the car it melted and became deformed. i will be ordering another."
"Negative","Trivial and confused: I read this book - hoping that it would represent some fresh ideas for the liberal mimded muslims amongst us. I could not wait to get home so that I could read it.Alas all it ended up providing was trite, cliche' ridden experience of a person who is craving attention, and hopes to propogate pseudo liberal views on a subject that she has obviously not understood, nor even spent time to study in some detail.The author uses every tool that she has at her disposal including deriding her family, her father, and making veiled references to a trumatic childhood - all in the hope of selling a few more copies.A total dissapointment - not worth your time."
"Positive","Elmore Leonard Stories Are the BEST!: This series is addicting in good way. Top notch acting by all. Good story lines and interesting charactersVery good story lines. Excellent acting."
"Negative","Hi 5 ""WOW"" cd: Bought this for my grandson because he loves HI 5. But it was the Australian version. He didn't recognize the singers and the songs sounded different. What a disappointment!!"
"Negative","Pass on this: This is primarily a collection of powerpoints-gone-DVD with a lifeless narrator. I am a huge fan of WWII material and this really fell short. Save your money for documentaries made by the big guys."
"Positive","My favorite ear was remover.: The formulation of this product is similar to others on the market but the tube dropper delivery system simplifies the application of the solution."
"Negative","too bad: Earl grant had a nice voice. Unfortunatelyhe is sabotaged here on nearly every trackby hokey arrangements - the organ inparticular is especially cloying.It's too bad when you think ofwhat might have been."
"Negative","Perfect if you need coal for Christmas...: This thing is terrible. At first I thought it was me, but after reading these reviews I feel so much better. The only thing it produces in charcoal. Sometime there is edible matter in the middle, sometimes it's pure charcoal. They should give me back the cost of the unit, PLUS the cost of all of the food I have wasted, PLUS the cost of the chinese food and pizza I have had to order as a quick replacement!!!"
"Positive","Best Mike Myers comedy: My personal favorite, this movie has lots of laughs, a great plot and the lovely Nancy Travis. What else do you need?"
"Positive","One Of The Great Films!: Fantastic movie! A remake of Romeo and Juliet set on the streets of 1950s New York. White impoverished kids whose families are from Poland, etc. battle gangs of Puerto Ricans in the streets. A Puerto Rican girl and Polish-American boy fall in love. Uh-oh! Lots of fighting and death. The odd point is that the story contains dancing, singing and a lot of energy. That is what makes it a great movie. Really affecting and very moving. A must see, over and over again."
"Negative","Not a very good book: The book is a collection of explanation and examples from the help database of Domino and this does not justify anything for the money paid to it.There is very minimum amount of info on important topics like Applets etc. where it has just one chapter on the applet.It is more of a remake of Help database, with 75% of the material similar to the Help.It would have been useful to the user if there was more explanation and examples."

"Positive","So simple but so awesome: I bought this toy for our new adopted kitten (10 weeks old when we got him). I didn't know if he would play with it or be scared of it, but he took to it right away, batting at the ball and chasing it around the track. It took him about a week to figure out that he could scratch on it, but once he did, he scratches on it for a while every day.The best thing that we figured out is to make a small tent out of cardboard (just fold a piece in half) and cover the ball with the tent. Our kitten goes crazy every single time we do it, he can't stand when the ball is ""hiding"" under the cardboard.I'm giving this toy 4 stars instead of 5 because it slides like crazy around our hardwood laminate floors. We put a small kitchen towel under it, and that reduces the sliding somewhat. They should really provide rubber feet or some other grippy surface to stick on the bottom for those of us who need to use it on non-carpeted surfaces."
"Positive","granite solid power metal: I went and found this album because I love Rob Rock as a vocalist and have enjoyed everything he has sang on. Didn't know he sang on this until recently. Dude............it rocks. Awesome chunky metal riffs in your face. Great production and of course great vocals. No nu here this is modern heavy power metal. Not super fast but as solid as it gets. If you like Rob's solo stuff or his work on Impelletteri or just superb power metal hunt this down. Why is this hard to find? More talent here then any of the joker bands wearing masks. If it's not available here check out Rad Rockers. (can i say that here?)"
"Negative","Gels when added to liquid: I have been using this product for many years. This is the first time I find it is gelling (forms hard lumps, even after hard stirring by spoon). I am wondering if any one else is having the same problem. The details of the batch is :LOT# 1493924 4:10Best used by 7/20/14 2694"
"Positive","The confession: Susanna is a girl who is the only person that knows the truth and is the only person that can stop the witch maddness in Salem. Can she stop the group of girls well to find out read the book"
"Negative","Bad Design: I purchased this to use with my Tivo. It worked fine till I messed with the cable on day, to use my laptop. Well now the cable will not stay in the adapter. It is flimsy and so you are automatically careful not to stress the connection, but it still got messed up.. Argh! I will probably go get the Netgear FA120 10/100 USB 2.0 Adapter to replace it."
"Positive","Crazy about the Wedding Planner: I loved this movie! Timless and classic, this movie is the best chick flick ever! I can't get enough of Lopez's style, and Matthew M. is a winner as well. The ending was no surprise, but it still made me cry. Great for a girl's night in!"
"Positive","A LOVELY BOOK!!!: Terri Farley creativity in creating a story has put her in a class of her own.When I read the synopsis I found that this book is something special which can make the readers curious to know the ending.I have to say that this book is absolutely interesting ,full of mystery and a worth buying."
"Negative","You get what you pay for: Pro: CheapCon: Sounds like audio from a super cheap usb sound card.I've used usb sound devices in the past that weren't too much more expensive than this one, and they actually sounded good. I listened to 3 songs on this bad boy and pulled it out of my computer. I'll keep it around just in case my mic jack ever goes out, but most likely it will sit in my closet and collect dust until I throw it away."
"Negative","Cheap: This vanity is so cute and my daughter loved receiving it for Christmas but the mirror came scratched, the drawer does not open and close properly and has now eventually broken."
"Positive","Up to my expectation: Another solid animated feature for DC Comics. I love this style of animated movie though I wish it would be longer. But the climax ending was exciting. Haven't got time to watch the 2nd disc yet but I'm sure it's great. Can't wait to see what they're trying to do with the upcoming Gotham Knight animated feature."
"Positive","Good Product, Great Service!: Does a great job for the price and seems to be quite accurate. Always matches the readings on the refractrometer and the fish store."
"Positive","Great but ...: Great product. Fits well, sturdy and great price for the quality. The only downside is and please note this ... it does NOT fit the SD500. I ended up giving this to my dad for his Canon SD200 and buying the Coach case for my SD500 instead, which by the way I give 5 stars!"
"Negative","One of the worst games I've ever played.: In my 30+ years of playing video games, Xenogears is one of the worst video game experiences of my life.About 80% of the ""gameplay"" is slowly advancing through text. And when I say slowly, I mean s...l...o...w...l...y. There is no option to speed up or skip the text - inexcusable for a game with this much text. Since they have put all their eggs into one basket - the story - if you don't like the story, you will not like this game.Except for a few boss battles, there is next to no strategy involved. If you do decide to get this game, follow a walkthough or use a boss strategy guide, since you don't want to be forced to sit through the same 15+ minutes of dialogue leading up to the battle.With this game, you are basically buying an expensive book. Do yourself a favor: Save some money, find a video of a playthrough, and watch it instead. You will not be missing much."
"Negative","Don't Get Burned: Since our son was born, we've been using Coppertone Water Babies sunscreen, but didn't like that it stung if it got into his eyes. When we found this, we were thrilled. I even put it on my hands and rubbed it into my eyes to make sure it was truly ""tear free"". In that respect, it's great. However, we've used it twice on our son. The first time (last weekend), he got a little bit red, but today, after being in the sun for only two hours, he's got the worst sunburn ever. I'm devastated since I'm very careful about his sun exposure (we're both fair-skinned). In the year and a half of using Water Babies, he NEVER had a sunburn. I also used this sunscreen today and I am sporting the worst burn of my life as well...it looks as though we went without any sunblock at all. I hope someone can learn from our bad experience."
"Negative","Mother of God!: Worst of all time. Flanigan and Zingale just defecated on my face with this pile of waste. My life has been wasted, I feel raped and alone. Watch CNN during election time and gather everything you ever need to know about the material in this book."
"Negative","worst shoes EVER, DON'T BUY IT: I usually don't review products but I had to tor this one. ITS THE WORST SHOES EVER. it ripped after 2 weeks. my knee started hurting like nothing else. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Its low low quality product."
"Negative","I hope his other books are better.: Friends keep after me to read something of Neal Stephenson's. So I tried-- really, I did. Give a science fiction writer a unix manual and a link to a basic webpage on cryptography and you'll get this bloated, 900 page bomb.If you are interested in cryptography, get a textbook. Most of them are more clearly written, less smarmy, and more entertaining.If you like science fiction, you can get a better story elsewhere that won't make you wade through chapters of bland, irrelevant material.This quasi-hyperrealistic approach should be left to better authors... This book has drained all desire from me to read other instances of the author's work."
"Negative","Wish I hadn't bought it: At first, our daughter hated cold wipes. She would cry at diaper changes. So my husband and I spent the money for this wipe warmer and thought it would be worth it if it warmed the wipes as advertised. We were very disappointed.The wipes are barely even room temperature, but worse than that, they're wet! Water drips from the warmer when you open the lid. They also smell funny. We never used wipes from the warmer. I figured a cool, fresh wipe from the plastic wipe tub was better than a cool, wet, stinky one from an overpriced wipe warmer. And after a few days, our daughter Riley got used to cool wipes and she no longer complains.My advice: save your money."
"Positive","Tight: Excellent novel, full of disjointed short stories, that really drive home the squalor and misery of modern, suburban life. It's a very blatant book, full of entertaining situations and disgusting parts that will make ye retch (some involve bodily secretions, let's leave it at that), but also, there's subtlety at work behind all that; Welsh does not make his work sensational and doesn't overstate what he's saying, which is a blinkin' good quality, in mine opinion. Read this. It's a tad better than the excellence of its film."
"Negative","Dont waste your money: The first time we brought this to the pool the plastic piece that keeps the front wheel on snapped off. The back wheels are too thin especially for the beach and sand. Not worth it!"
"Positive","Unique and practical guide: Most wedding guides assume you want hundreds of guests and everything has to be OTT-with-frills-on! This author shows you that it is ok to go OTT if that's your style, but also that it's ok NOT to. Priceless advice, really down-to-earth attitude to weddings. There's one wedding experience described that cost less than $2000 and one that cost nearly ten times that - with many others inbetween! This is not only a guide for the budget-conscious, but a great overall how-to for anyone planning an intimate wedding. Many tips on how to save money, but the focus is on planning a special day - YOUR WAY. Ignore the multi-billion dollar wedding industry's pushy advice - this author is really symphathetic to the stress of the whole thing, and she will give you advice that makes it a joy to organise and experience. Haven't had my wedding yet, but am looking forward to it, as I relax and relish the simplicity of the whole plan. Enjoy planning your day!"
"Positive","IT'S A HIT!: I PURCHASED THIS TO MAKE SNOWCONES FOR MY KIDS AND GRANDKIDS. I REALLY LOVE IT! THE SNOW COMPARTMENT IS LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD SEVERL SERVINGS OF PERFECTLY SHAVED ICE, AND CLEAN UP IS A SNAP. SO FAR IT SEEMS TO BE A QUALITY PRODUCT AND PERHAPS THE MORE I USE IT THE SHARPER THE BLADES GET. I USUALLY FREEZE A GALLON ICE CREAM BUCKET AND CHOP IT DOWN FOR ICE, SINCE I DON'T HAVE AN ICE MAKER IN MY FRIDGE. I EVEN MADE SOME FLAVORED ICE TO SHAVE, AND CLEAN-UP WAS NO MORE OF A TASK THAN WHEN I USED JUST ICE. I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES SNOWCONES OR SLUSHIES."
"Negative","8 of 10 are not the originals, save your money!: Another really cheap rip-off, and frankly, a waste of everybody's time. Even the two original tracks are poorly edited. The [small print] disclaimer says ""This album may contain re-recorded tracks by the original artist. Tracks featuring groups may not include the original members."" Well, if any or all of that is the case, then why even bother making this joke? Not even worth $3. Put that money toward the originals. Deserves zero stars."
"Positive","I really enjoyed it...: Co-op offline, vs offline, online play, single player mode offline --- all these features come in a lot of games, however the graphics, the realism & the nearly-unlimited opponents do not.Overall, I liked this game, the co-op should of let you view third-person, but other than that, I felt the modes were awesome.Customize your character...Battle 50+ people at one time with a friend helping...It's a great game."
"Negative","The Above Reviews are Phoney: It's some writer working under a pseudonym, getting writer-friends to write these horrible, long-winded reviews."
"Negative","Oh, Dean....: i never thought i'd write a bad review of a dean koontz book, but this one really disappointed me. i can hardly put my finger on what i didn't like...maybe it's because it was too short to develop the characters. or maybe that the story was just silly. anyway, i like every other book i've ever read by him, so i guess not liking only one is a pretty good average!"
"Positive","2nd best album: This album may not be as good as ""Core"", but it easily comes in 2nd. Down and Sour girl are classics. Every song on this cd is good. A must have for all S.T.P. fans!"
"Negative","not good quality: I have an Oxo Good Grips Soap Squirting Dish Sponge. The sponge does not stay on; I have it fixed with a rubber band. I had a previous Oxo dishwashing sponge that filled from the end and did not squirt soap. The sponge did not stay on. The last Oxo dishwashing item I bought, in the hope that they finally had a quality product was an Oxo dishwashing brush. The soap doesn't squirt out properly. So, as far as I am concerned 3 times and, Oxo,you're out. I won't buy another of your products. Designs seem good; something is wrong with their execution. Martha B. Ashton-Sikora"
"Negative","The low, low point in a slow, steady decline: Sex, eroticism, passion . . . with a corpse.Despite Anita Blake's ealier revulsion with ""sex with a corpse"" she nevertheless spends about 30 pages engaged in such with Jean-Claude.Honestly, this book has none of the charm and the supernatural thrills of the first books, but rather reflects a climax of Laurell K. Hamilton's slow and steady descent into eroticism from day one.Don't expect to see new supernatural creatures like the Naga, Bloody Bones, or even Voodoo witches in this one, kids. In fact, it's one really long tale of Anita Blake's trials and tribulations deciding between Jean-Claude and Richard.Honestly, I loved these books, and this was the one that made me stop reading the series."
"Positive","Great album, better than Los Lonelyboys.: Great album - missed hearing it over the years.For any of the new generation that likes the Los Lonely Boys you will most like this album."
"Negative","Unrealistic!: Erm, I hated this book. I myself am a self-injurer and I thought this book just awful. The ending was very dissapointing, and unrealistic. I wouldn't have even given it one star but I had to give it something. My opinion- don't waste your time."
"Negative","No closed captioning: I give this DVD a ZERO. Docurama didn't care enough to caption this DVD for hearing-impaired people.With the DVD being totally useless to us and all, I shouldn't care about saying anything nice about this DVD.Shame on you Docurama for NEVER captioning your DVDs all these years. :("
"Positive","very enjoyable: This is the saga of two intertwined Jewish families living in England between the 1930's and 1950's. Although I had a little trouble keeping track of the characters (be sure your copy has the family tree in the front--you'll need it), I found this book to be a great read. The author is careful to present both side of all of the character's stories, so no one is portrayed as all good or all bad. I plan to read more by this author."
"Negative","B-O-R-I-N-G: Oh my gosh, I have no idea whats the big deal with this movie. I was bored to death on the whole movie. The fights looks so fake and the acting is even worst. The special effects are v good but thats all I found interesting. The big finale lacked passion in my opinion and wasnt that clear either. I guess Im gonna get yelled here for saying all this but trust me, Ive seen lots & lots of movies & Ive seen movies with way lower budget much better than this. Thanks Gosh its over."
"Positive","Great Linux Start Up book buy it!: This book is great it will get anyone that does not know a single thing about linux up and running in no time! It even comes with the popular RedHat Linux 5.0 distribution all the tools you will need are also included on the CD. Great book, go out and buy it."
"Positive","A stunning, lyrical tale: Though it has flaws, heaven knows, this tale of trampled innocence is moving, at times beautifully written, and deeply satisfying. If the title character's quasi-religious epiphany at the end doesn't reach quite the heights of profundity the author clearly intended, it nevertheless evokes a powerful sense of empathy and pity from the reader. The antagonist's final actions before abruptly departing from the pages of the novel are mysterious indeed (a less polite reader might attribute this to the writer's clumsiness), but in some ways fit perfectly into the novel's existential scheme. An awfully good read."
"Positive","A Thrilling Conclusion to the Series!: Angel Fire East is a thrilling conclusion to the Running With the Demon series. Living near the real-life Hopewell IL. (Sterling), I could visualize all of the streets, parks, and landmarks described throughout. I felt the action in this book was comparable to the first book and MUCH better than the second book. Although predictable at some points, the ending is truly unexpected. We real life Hopewell residents can only hope that there will be a fourth book down the road. The entire series is a must read for all Brooks followers."
"Negative","Very light comedy: This is what might be called a ""light romance"" and not a screwball comedy at all. It's about a family of con artists that goes straight after encountering a generous old lady. The casting is poor. (It was nearly Gaynor's last film, for obvious reasons. Richard Carlson is wasted entirely, and Fairbanks is wholly unconvincing.) There are no laughs. Some of the sets are incredibly phony. And in the end the director had to rely on a parade of pups to generate good feelings. In short, this is a time waster, alarmingly out of step with the great comedies being made at the time. It's hard to believe that Selznik could be so clueless."
"Positive","Great to add for a gift: Nice way to add what is inside the jar, also I like that it goes on the lid instead of the jar."
"Positive","math text: good for professionals. not so appropriate for an introductory course to building trades, in my opinion."
"Positive","Father Donald Cozzens in Commonweal (March 23, 2003): In times of crisis, effective leaders understand the urgent need for honesty and candor, for the kind of truth telling that allows for healthy, creative responses....It is one of the graces of crises that truth telling unfetters the imagination and offers hope and direction...In the present church crisis, Paul Dinter emerges as a significant truth teller...Dinter has succeeded in writing a brave memoir and a penetrating critique of the current structures of the institutional church."
"Positive","DVD already: Put the show on DVD already!!! They haven't even syndicated it...is someone holding the originals ransom or something?"
"Negative","As described by other reviewers: Product is cheaply made as described by others, but equivalent to the price. The logo on the hat is just a sticker which was stuck to the packaging and came off upon opening. As the options for Thomas are fairly limited, this is not a terrible costume and should last a few wears. Hangs down to just above the shoes of our 2yo so it would probably fit up to a 4yo."
"Negative","Missing a few essentials IMHO: Temp review for the quick read I did as I just sold the book:Well written for the most part, easy to follow.Negatives:Federal Reserve Act relegated to one sentence. The nefarious legislation of 1913 affected this country in so many ways, it deserves at least a page.The CFR (Council on Foreign Relations is not even mentioned) Inasmuch as the majority of our 'leaders' in this government are members of this secretive society I assert it also deserves at least, one page.Why do authors continue to relegate footnotes to some distant part of the book, thereby aggravating readers to no end ?Holy Alliance ? This term is used without defining what he means.Possibly in the next edtion the author might add a bit of discussion about how corporations, foundations, associations and the shadow govt play a part in our 'foreign policy'.all for now"
"Negative","Common Sense Book: I have read about half of the book and i dont even want to read the other half its just not interesting at all. The writer talks about basic information nothing special."
"Negative","You could do so much better.: ""Take Her To The Zoo"" is a seven song EP from Albany newcomers the VodkaSonics. The experience of former Subduing Mara bassist Brendan Slater and former Bloom drummer JJ ""Hollywood"" Hogan can't make up for the obvious inexperience of singer/guitarist/songwriter Seth Powell. These sound like they were probably the first seven songs he ever wrote, and the hooky basslines only attempt to disguise the near-total lack of personality in the rest of the music. I guess we can only hope that Powell goes out and listens to some Elvis Costello and the Attractions records (as Slater clearly has) before he writes his next record. There is a bright spot or two (hence the extra star). ""Knock Me Down"" is actually a bright , hooky pop tune that will more than likely stick with yoy, but from there on, you'll notice the similarities in each and every song. Sorry, guys, but you could do so much better."
"Positive","Pretty good selection: This is good if you're looking for something different. Lots of songs from the same thing (Oliver, Beatles, Elvis), but also a smattering of other ones. Even though there are a lot of the same faces, there are still a lot. It's going to take you a while to work your way through them anyway, and for the amount of songs there, it is a good deal. Good songs, too, just in case you're worried (i.e. no Mexican Hat Dance)."
"Negative","there are better latin videos: This video was ok. The set and the instructor are likeable but the instructions were horrendous - you had no idea where she was going until she was already into the next move. I agree with another viewer - Kathy Smith's Latin workout is MUCH better than this - better instruction, more authentic Latin music & moves as well. But for 10 bucks, it's not bad if you just want another tape to keep you from getting bored."
"Positive","Reinventing the Bazaar: Two Thumbs Up!: Reinventing the Bazaar used real-life examples to make markets understandable to any reader. From pharmaceutical companies to the Tokyo fish market, McMillan brings markets alive right in front of the readers' eyes. He attempts to demystify the mystery behind markets, and in my opinion, he succeeds. Each chapter presents a new market setting which McMillan uses to illustrate his various points. While the book has an economic undertone, the level of writing is not above the understanding of even a high school student. All terminology is explained not only with words, but with examples, as well. The book was enjoyable, especially if you have little familiarity with various market settings. However, I would encourage anyone to read this book because even the experts on markets will have their knowledge enriched by this book."
"Negative","This movie is so tired.: Let me say this straight out... the movie is fictional. For me to try and understand, truly understand, how corrupt business and politicians have hijacked our foreign policy by watching this movie, would be like trying to understand the dogma of the Catholic church by watching another work of fiction, ""The Da Vinci Code"".Are we Americans so stupid in our understanding of international history, and the currents and eddies behind world events, they must be explained to us through fiction? If so, we deserve our current predicament, which should only worsen our ignorance.I challenge filmmakers to educate us with accurate portrayals of history. OK, so these movies may not have headliner opening weekends. But truth will educate throughout the years, and a movie true to history will continue to teach even when it sits on the DVD"
"Positive","Pretty darned cool: This isn't my favorite Date book by any means, but it does go into the finer details or Codd's work and it does so at a level that really does Codd's work justice.If you aren't really into Codd's work, and you are trying to find an intro to DB Theory, this definitely isn't for you. However, if you are looking for a great theoretical analysis of one of the greatest mind's in Computer Science, this is a great book."
"Positive","Looks good: Honestly, I didn't notice much difference when putting it on my microphone. I guess it might help somehow. But it fits very well with my Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB microphone and looks super cute."
"Positive","Filler for free shipping!: While I added this item to my cart primarily to take me into free shipping awesomeness I did appreciate that this item isn't complete junk. It's actually useful for hanging stuff on your walls. Of course they leave little pinholes where you pinned something up but it's small enough not to matter. Price is good, items works as described. NO com"
"Positive","Great popcorn popper: It is simple to use , and it's trivial to measure the right amount of popcorn to be popped. I've had one for 6 years and it's still working great. This new one is for my other home..."
"Negative","not what expected: I was looking for a yoga routine for my husband and myself to do together, like one that you would do if you were to take a class, so we got this dvd, but there was too much talking in the begining and soft porn type of sections where the people are doing their yoga without clothing. It just was not the type of yoga routine that we were looking for, we really were hoping for a boding routine that went smothing from one postion to the next not one that talked and they just showed the position without explaining how to get into that position. Could work for some but jsut not our style"
"Positive","Strong, but not Perfect: Pantera's second non-hair metal album, and not aaa bad one. Phil's vox on this album have become a might too monochromatic and aggro, when compared to Cowboys from Hell, though. The songwriting is similarly more catered to the aggro crowd than on Cowboys. Don't get me wrong, Pantera's thrash sesibilities are stronger than the nineties mallcore leanings by far, but the riffs are just a might too simple and chunky. Dimebag's leads are quite impressive, the man had a gift for pinch harmonics. Overall, a good but not great release."
"Positive","really good: i think this book is very good. its a bit hard to understand it you havent read the first 4 books. thats the only setback of it"
"Positive","Perfect tool: Cleared up my drain within seconds. Highly recommended! It says not to reuse, but I found that if you use a paper towel to shield your hand from the sharp edges you can clean it off easily."
"Negative","OK for desk top phone - won't work as wall phone: Just wanted a simple corded phone to use on the wall in the basement. Receiver will not stay in place when using as a wall phone so it is useless as a wall phone. For the low price it is not worth the shipping costs to return. No issues with Amazon but it should not be advertised as a wall phone."
"Negative","Was excited, but not anymore...: I was really impressed when this set arrived; it is very attractive & they were perfectly sharp right out of the box. I couldn't believe what I paid for them, but then I quickly learned that you get what you pay for. One time through the dishwasher (box states: DISHWASHER SAFE) and there are already rust-spots... Needless to say I'm not impressed with this product.1 star for appearance."
"Positive","different but fun: By my count there are about 6 or 7 Harvest Moon games out there for various systems, so Natsume must be doing something right. In fact, they recently released number 3 for the Gameboy Color.On Save the Homeland, the graphics are much improved (obviously) from any other version on the market. I have been playing it now for just a couple days, and I am already hooked. From what I read, the game focuses more on interaction with the townspeople than it does making money. I don't really agree with this; making money seems to be the primary goal. Plus, the people that I keep running into on an (hourly) basis don't have a whole lot to say or do. They are just sort of roaming around, and tell you some little cheesy statement about life.I do have one question; where in the...is the dog food?"
"Positive","The funniest game you'll ever play: This game is endlessly amusing and super easy for almost everyone to play. All the details are super delightful, from aquiring 'young 'ens' to getting a 'rig' and getting married (and divorced and remarried) the options are endless, you'll never have the same journey twice. The game even offers suggestions on different ways to play and an expansion pack which offers even more options. By far the best game I've purchased, I reccomend it to anyone who wants a laughter filled, light hearted evening."
"Negative","Horrible!: This CD is a disgrace to loyalty!I like the beats Eminem made, but they didnt fit the vocals. He either slowed down or sped up Tupac's voice to match whatever beats he wanted to use.Ghetto Gospel is one of the worst songs on the whole album. The voice is so slowed down and more than 70% of it is missing from the original, whats up with that?Not to mention in the song Loyal To The Game. He takes out the 2 original people and adds G-Unit? What the ****? All that song sounds like is mis-matching verses that have nothing in common.Don't buy it, it isnt worth it. If you REALLY want it, download it, but don't give Tupac's mother any money. I can't believe she allowed this to happen. This is the worst CD ever put out in Tupac's name."
"Positive","Neglected masterpiece: Back when bands were somehow able to make live recordings full of surprises, excitement, and occasional group improvisation, this one is a diamond in the rough. I've owned the vinyl for well nigh 25 years now, and the utterly unadorned sounds of the guitar, the bass, the drums, plus the howling voice of Paul Rodgers - why, it's primal blues rock at its sparest ... and most devastating. Andy Fraser's bass lines are lithe and kinetic. Paul Kossoff wrenches notes from the neck of his Les Paul in a style that still sets him apart from all who have followed. He left us far too soon. Only complaint is the haphazard rendition of ""All Right Now"" - (they were probably sick of it by then)."
"Negative","author is capable of much better than this: I have read a number of Linda Howard books and waited impatiently for the publication of this one. What a disappointment! The characters and plot were very underdeveloped and the book, in general, was boring. Linda Howard is an excellent author and is capable of much better works than this book. Linda, please write us a worthy successor to ""Son of the Morning"" and ""Dream Man""!!"
"Negative","Good idea - poor design: While the iGo Juice is a great idea and potentially useful for travellers, after 4 uses the end that connects to the PC adapter snapped right off. The design of the tip is far too flimsy especially for travel. (Two of the four uses were at home, two on the road)Calling technical support didn't help either - no return call after two attempts.Good idea - poor design, not great customer service. If Mobility improve their design, I'd certainly consider trying again. But until then - back to one plug per gadget!"
"Positive","great writing, scenery and acting!: I love it; makes american mystery shows seem silly and boring! Nine more words? Great, great and still great! What fun!"
"Negative","Pompous, Pretentious, ----: These are all pseudo-intellectual, academic wannabe articles that are completely full of s*** and have no value. You can flip through and read any one sentence and come to the same conclusion. Completely useless, except to other 'academics' who like to BS in order to pretend that they have some use to the world."
"Positive","Great machine that lasts and it's made in the USA!: We just purchased our third machine, not because they broke, we just needed another one. The first one I bought was about 8 years ago and it's still going strong. The great thing about this machine, besides being made in the USA, is its range of volume from barely over a whisper to loud enough not to here what is going on in the next room."
"Negative","Comic Book the Movie: This is a real treat for anyone who loves Comics. The special features alone were worth the movie price. Mark Hamill really gave a heart felt love letter to the Comic Fans. I really enjoyed picking out the voice over talents of some of my favorite cartoon stars as well. Mark truley hired a great grup of men and women who are all talents we dont get to see infront of a camera and gave them a plat form to do their stuff. His integration of the fictional comic book charater in to a real life comic book convention was fantastic. And of course it is always great to see Kevin Smith and Stan Lee.I believe everyone who loves comics as I do will get the inside jokes and the love of the industry and if you werent a comic fan before you just might be after you watch.Great job Mark!!!!"
"Positive","Great Price! Great Book!: The price was great and the book arrived in good shape on time. I now have both the hard and paperback copies of this collection. One of the best historical text around."
"Positive","An absoute must for the experimter: This is an absolute classic. Used as a college text, it is still very relevant to the backyard scientist."
"Positive","My 18 month old's favorite video!: My son has been watching this video for several months & it is still his favorite video! Everyday, he gives me the dvd to put on & watches it over & over & over. It's great for infants & toddlers because it's all music & the characters are cute little babies. My son loves music & loves to dance so it keeps him glued to the tv. He can't get enough of it! It tells several short musical ""stories"" about Baby Elmo, Cookie Monster, Big Bird & Prairie Dawn. In each story, it shows real babies & their mommies dancing too. This is a great video & a nice change from the traditional Sesame Street videos."
"Positive","Makes me want to run through fields barefoot on a warm, summer day!: Some bands try to write songs that give the listener beautiful imagery that transports them into a different world or to a different age. Some succeed whereas some sacrifice melody to do so. Sam Beam, however, succeeds more than any recent artist that I can remember. There's a special feeling you get when you listen to it - it takes me back to a kid in simpler times during summer vacations where we would play outside for hours and be content laying on the grass and staring at the clouds. With his hushed vocals and sparse instrumentation, Iron and Wine sets the standard for bands to follow. Highlights include: On Your Wings, Naked As We Came, Sunset Soon Forgotten, Radio War, and Passing Afternoon. His voice sounds one part Elliott Smith, one part Sufjan Stevens, and one part Beck (in Sea Change). The best thing about this album is that it has a timeless feel to it, because it will always transport you to a different world."
"Positive","Don't miss this one!: A must have album! Nothing in the world can bring tears to my eyes like the voice of the young Mary Travers as in 500 miles and There is a Ship. I was hoping that when the album was re-mixed that they would lower the volume of the applause after each song, but alas, they didn't. Even with the loud applause, the album is a hit and should be a part of everybodys collection."
"Positive","The Great Grimmerie: This book has all a Wicked fan could ask for. From cast members to pictures and from songs to scrpit and much more I saw the show and bought the Grimmerie. I got it for $40 but it was worth it this book has everything and the pictures and cover are nice. They have the words to all the songs they have the story of wicked from brainstroming to broadway and they have the scrpit. They also have all the cast members talking about their charecter. And I lot more speicle stuff that you will have to see when you buy the book. So if you love like or just think Wicked is o.k. you have to get this book."
"Negative","Can't work with Multiple Devices at the SAME TIME: I got this and two Sony Bluetooth headphones for my parents as Christmas gifts. They watch many British TV shows and have difficulty understanding the dialog sometimes due to the accents. We thought two wireless headphones would be great. After extensive online research and reading all these raving reviews, we decided on this one. Unfortunately, no matter how hard we tried, we could not get both headphones working at the same time. My wife then read the whole instruction book. On page 20, in tiny fine print, it says ""This unit cannot be connected to multiple devices at the same time."" This is ridiculous! It renders the device utterly useless for our purpose, but the fact that it can only be paired with one headset at a time is hidden deep in the instruction manual. No warning given! We have wasted our money and are very, very, very disappointed."
"Positive","Pure, unadultered emotion.: In the book ""Furacao Elis"" the author writes about the difficulty between Tom and Elis in recording this album, as both ideas of what the album should be, differed radically. Through the anger and joy in finding a collective idea as to what direction the album should be moving in, one can hear the range of emotions in each of the artist's voices. Elis Regina and Tom Jobim's ""Aguas De Marco"" is with all sincerity the most truly emotional and unpretentiously sophisticated song I have ever heard in my life, and for this it continues to be, in my opinion, the greatest work not only of Jobim, but of any of his contemporaries.--Taylor"
"Positive","Ghost Soldiers: Can't wait for a movie. It was great. couldn't put the book down. It also brought to light how the men felt about Gen. McArther, somthing I did not know, and how the men were on both sides. It kept you with the rangers but yet did not take you away from the POW's."
"Negative","Unlikely: I have received 2 copies of this movie and neither one of them plays. I love the movie itself so I'm very disappointed it doesn't work!"
"Negative","Atomic Clock: You charged me shipping charges and the e-mail said that if I bought an item over a certan amount that I would not be charged shipping.The big thing is, the clock has a outside tempature monotor and the 1st time it rained it quit working. I have tried everything to get it working ie, replaced bateries, etc. It still a no go.Chuck LewisLa Crosse Technology WS-8117U-IT-AL Atomic Clock with Remote Temperature (Purchased on 07/09/2009)by La Crosse Technology"
"Negative","Surprised...: Be sure to read the find print. I was planning on using this book as a tool to help me identify and treat skin conditions in clinical practice. There are no pictures in this book, which for skin conditions you would think wouldbe a necessity. If you don't need to visually see the skin condition then you may be able to use this book, but as for me it sits unused on the shelf."
"Positive","Nice Explanations: This book is a great book for people inturested in Personality Phsychology. It gives clear explanations and if it's still unclear it will give an example or two."
"Negative","Misinterpretation of Satie's music: The poetry, subtle energy and elasticity of Satie's music is entirely lost in De Leeuw's interpretations. The pieces are drawn out to an extent where each note becomes a fragment that does not add up to a whole. The music of Satie thus becomes as unengaging as elevator music.Eric Satie was a restless and discontented innovator who barely had finished with one musical style until he moved on to the next. This tireless energy can be found in other recordings of Satie's music - most notably by Anne Queffelec - where even the most famous of Satie's composition, the slow Gymnopedies 1-3, reflect Satie's dynamic persona.In order to profoundly understand music and see it from the inside, it is necessary for the interpretor to understand its composer. This is not the case with De Leeuw."
"Negative","Not a good ending...: I enjoyed much of the book. It was a great experience to read how people experience religion, ritual. Creation of miths and mysticism's neurological definitions were great. Relations of brain higher, sophisticated regions within themselves and to lower, primitive regions were defined clearly. But the last 2 chapters assumed the existence of God and that's a big shadow on the book. Science does not deal with God. So writers clearly put their personal, subjective experiences in life to a ""scientific"" book. Great beginning, poor ending."
"Negative","This book is small: I was expecting a full size hard cover and got a mini me hard cover book. Paid a hard cover price. Should have went to Barnes and Noble. Will next time."
"Negative","Not what I expect from Justin: I have worn Justin Brand boots for 20+ years and I really thought these were fake when I first put them on. These are stiff, rubber soled, with a very thin insole. My 10 year old Justin boots were comfortable the first time I put them on so I bought 2 pair. My previous Justin boots were the best most comfortable shoes I ever wore so I am very surprised by these.I pay about this much to have a new sole put on my old Justin boots so it seemed like a bargain until I tried them on. My cobbler says he can't replace the soles because they are rubber. He can only replace leather soles. I deleted every clothing item I was considering to buy from my Amazon wish list. I was just so disappointed."
"Positive","Roses are reds, violets are blue, this movie is recommended for you!: A warm and rather lighthearted movie that is pleasing to most tastes and obviously uplifting to the vast majority of reviewers here at Amazon. Not a whole lot of character development throughout the movie, but the characters are rather endearing nonetheless. Some will be skeptical as to the plausibility of such a prison set up, but it was refreshing to see an approach to incarceration that offers some real rehabilitation and redemption."
"Positive","Brought Me Out of the Closet: I used to be ashamed of being gay, in many ways, I still am. But this book helped me embrace my inner 'mo. The other day, I was brave enough to discuss a homoerotic fantasy in public! Namely the one [...] In other words...I'm Positively Gay!"
"Negative","Disappointed after reading great reviews: This movie got great reviews so I looked forward to watching it. I'm an Aussie living overseas so like to watch as many Aussie movies as I can, and almost always enjoy them. This was the exception. There were just too many parts of the movie where the story line didn't make a lot of sense. Then there was all the 70's ""artsy"" stuff which was a turn off. I will keep it in my collection but probably won't watch it again."
"Positive","God Sent: I was so glad to have been able to have found this product on your site. It is the best cleanser that I have been able to fine to take care of my skin."
"Negative","DOES NOT FIT: Is not even compatible with my 2004 Toyota solara, pins aren't even close to matching. Size not even close either, waste of time and money."
"Positive","Good book, but not quite what I hoped for...: I am a small group leader, and needed both a historical and theological perspective regarding Satan. Pastor Lutzer provides some limited historical material, but his main focus is the theological aspects concerning Satan and his relationship to our all-powerful God. Despite the limited historic information, it is still quite a good book about Satan, and I highly recommend it. I really appreciate Pastor Lutzer's religious books!"
"Positive","another G raided album: raided came through once again. i dont think this cd has many songs that arent tight. buy it if you like raided."
"Negative","BUYER BEWARE!!!: This company does not live up to their promises when supporting their products. Once they sell you a product, you are essentially on your own if if breaks or does not work as advertised. I do not recommend purchasing ANY of their products. They will leave you high and dry!!!"
"Negative","hmmm...: This is not one of Madness's better albums. They were just starting to chart the waters between ska and pop, and it was kind of rough sailing. The singles are okay, but the album as a whole is pretty much forgettable."
"Negative","little value: I bought this for my son when he turned 2 as he is a runner. He thought it was cute but there was no way we keep him from removing it from his clothes as it just clips on. We tried butting it in a pocket of his clothes but could not get it to work. We were better served by the backpack monkey harness. I couls have sold 20 of those in the airport during out trip."
"Negative","Mob story: I was looking for a good mystery. This story is primarily about a young chef's experience with the mob. The environment is more New Jersey ""Goodfellas"" than a kitchen. Mob pressure , crime and threats were not what I hoped to find in the story."
"Positive","Cute Book!: This book is really adorable. My son loves to feel the textured web as it gets closer and closer to being finished with each page. He also likes to look for the fly on each page. I'd recommend it to anyone!"
"Negative","Not a good ROMANCE: Linda Howard is usually one of the best romance writers out there; I must say that I was rather disappointed with her latest book. While it does portray a woman of extraordinary strength with courage etc., it also fails to make convincing the emotions between hero and heroine. They don't meet(in the flesh, so to speak) for way too long. Ms Howard's focus was definitely on Grace, not the relationship between the lovers, and I personally found that when they did meet, their love tended to be purely sexual. While I enjoy hot love scenes, it's certainly not to the exclusion of any of the finer feelings...I found this to be more a book about a woman discovering herself anew rather than a couple building towards a life together. I hope Ms Howard returns to her usual highly emotionally charged love scenes and close intimate relationship focus for her forthcoming work"
"Positive","Fantastic Book: I have already used many of the tutorials in this book. They are clear and to the point also including variations so you can achieve different looks. My Jade and ivory beads turned out great, can't wait to do more."
"Positive","At the top of his form!: GS and BJ were a awsome duo.You don't have to agree with the politics in order to enjoy it. He is an powerful musical poet who recorded a string of jamming albums that moved your soul as well as your feet. GS is a balladeer of moving emotions just listen to ""Winter in America"". One only hopes that he can shake his demons and return to form! Buy It!"
"Negative","Not What It Used To Be: My last Hot Tools flat iron lasted for 15 YEARS of professional use. So, when it finally died recently I didn't hesitate to buy another. But, like everything else they don't make them like they used to. On about the tenth use, I turned it on to heat up and it made a popping sound, started to smoke and the handle melted. I had owned it for 35 days, (five days past Amazon's return policy) so I can't return it. I'm stuck sending it back to the manufacturer and paying shipping both ways. Boo!"
"Negative","Missing pieces: This was my second time buying this police costume for my son. The first time I returned it because it didn't include everything it says it's suppose to; it was missing the cap, plastic baton, handcuffs, radio, badge, and get real gear. Basically all it included was the police jumpsuit and belt. I had hoped it was a mistake and purchased it a second time but I received the same thing. my son was extremely disappointed, I would not recommend buying this product.Jr. Police Officer Kids Costume"
"Positive","Great Story well written and told: You'll get the most out of this story if you play golf. If you've watched golf then you'll get something out of it. This story revolves around a game between the two best players in the 30's and a local hero. Golf is a metaphor for life and the story is told brilliantly. Highly recommend."
"Negative","Ho Hum: It was developed in 1300 AD. They shared ancient world paganism. Man was a creation of god. They lived in towns. The knights adhered to chivalry and priests & monks lives were based on religion. The church was concerned with this life as well as the next. Leonardo da Vinci personified the renaissance spirit."
"Negative","An expensive mistake: All the functions work well except the alarm is very soft.After wearing it on my belt loop for one week, the carabiner clip came off the watch allowing it to fall to the ground. The watch was not hurt but it is of no further use since it cannot be used on the belt loop as intended."
"Positive","Very Compelling.: This book really pulls you in. As both the authors write independent sections, the book has a ""journal"" quality. I tore through it in a day, and I must say, it has really made me think seriously about my faith (Catholicism), and how much I take it for granted."
"Positive","Better than the Original: Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time is even better than it's predeccessor, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga. This game has and even better battle system, the boss battles are longer and more challenging. Before this game, I was getting sick of boss battles that could be beaten in less than 2 minutes. This game makes the boss battles harder too. It's also a long adventure that will take you around 25 hours to complete, and it's worth replaying. Overall, this is one of the top 3 Nintendo DS games. I rate this game 94.5/100."
"Negative","Wrong Breadbox: The item that I received and paid for was not ""Brabantia"" brand. It was Home Basics that I could get a most houseware stores for $15. It was not packaged just came in its origianl box. The items was bent in several places, therefore I just sent it right back."
"Negative","Only For Beginers: In my opinion, this book is not worth buying, unless you are truly a beginner. And even then, you will quickly outgrow this book. It contains practices that you can quickly pick up at the stable where your lessons are. To learn them from others at your stable will more likely help you, because it will be in more detail and you will watch someone do it."
"Negative","Bra: Very poor support and material is not of a good quality. Would not recommend as one that can help posture."
"Positive","Few comic books can claim to be Literature: This is an excellent book, I encourage you to buy it today!Most comic books are shallow, ridiculous stories with flat, uninteresting characters. The issues are painted in black and white and one side is explicitly presented as the side of absolute Good. The Watchmen is different. The story is multifaceted and the characters are much more complicated than they first appear (In fact, I also recommend that you read the book at least twice!). There is no faction in the Watchmen that can claim a monopoly on ""Truth, Justice, and the American Way,"" and no assumption that this is desirable or even possible. Without qualification, this is the best book I have read for pleasure in a very long time."
"Negative","Product not as advertised!: The actual TV event on Lifetime with these women was incredible! I was hoping this CD was the audio of the show and those performances. Instead, it is merely a compilation of songs from each of these artists' own CDs. In most cases, I have the songs already. I was very disappointed. The a capella version of Ooh Child with Cyndi Lauper and Destiny's Child was unforgettable. And when else are you ever going to see Amy Grant and Melissa Etheridge sing together?! And my favorite was when all the women who played guitar sat around a jammed 5 or 6 songs together...priceless!! I wish someone would put out a DVD of the actual show so we could all enjoy the audio and video from that remarkable evening!!"
"Negative","Nice features but No range: This phone has about a 20 foot range before it starts cutting out. It has great features but you can't really move all about your home."
"Positive","I love this book!: I really have enjoyed this book. I have made so many baby sweaters from it for gifts and charity auctions. The instructions are very easy to follow and it has a variety of sizes, from 0-3 months - 12-24 months."
"Positive","Fabulous Diapers: For the first six months of our son's life, we used Pampers. We found them to be better than Huggies. Then we were introduced to Seventh Generation diapers. Not only are they environmentally friendly, but they are a perfect fit for our son. He is taller than most babies, and very skinny. We find that these diapers work well for us. He is in a size 4 and there is still a lot of room to grow.We love that these diapers do not leak and fit snuggly. The natural color is perfect too. We could not be happier. We would highly recommend this product."
"Negative","I am disappointed: I feel nothing but disappointed...I was expecting to watch some essences of Academy Award show for last 30 years, but I got nothing but the shortfilm of nominated movies...Totally different to what I expect..If you have same expectation as me, which is just to watch the ""orginal"" award show and their acceptance speeches, DON'T BUY IT"
"Positive","French Version of Relic: In case anyone was wondering what this book was, it is the English translation of the French Translation of 'Relic', not a new book or rare one."
"Negative","Incomplete: In general I have been happy with Target furniture, but this piece arrived without directions. When I complained to Target and then to the packing company, they assured me I would receive a replacement directions packet within 3 working days. It has now been two weeks and the pieces are still sitting in my bedroom. It has been a frustrating experience to deal with these companies."
"Positive","It 's cute.: This not the size i expect from the picture. But I love the tiny size it has. It's sooo cute and tiny. Perfect for single person. Though it's a bit burned at the bottom when cooked, but it's easily removed by water and the burned rice taste good at some points. lol"
"Positive","Nice yoga mat: This is a nice yoga mat. I am s beginner-intermediate. For me, it has the right mixture of thickness and firmness, and some stickiness to keep me from sliding. I also think it is a lot of fun to have so many color choices."
"Negative","JUNK!!! AVOID!!!: This is a cheap piece of crap, plain and simple. Don't waste your money. Mine is already cracked all the way through after only a few months of normal usage. The 15 year-old blender I resurrected is still great and going strong, so I'm going to order that 6-piece Oster replacement set for about $14 and see if *that* part is any better. I don't need anything else in the set, but that's the only other way on Amazon to get this base replacement part. Hopefully it's not the exact same thing -- some of the reviews of that product suggest it might be better quality. I'll report once it arrives."
"Negative","Superfluous racial epithets ruin any movie.: As a suspense movie, I guess it was mildly entertaining: it had the criminals we applaud and the plot turns we hope for, sort of, but I can't understand, especially in today's culture, how Mamet (who knows a little something about racism) would think it witty to incorporate lines like ""as long as a chinaman's name"" or ""cute as a Chinese baby"" (when referring to something clearly NOT cute) into the already flimsy script. If you have to resort to lines like that, perhaps it's time to hang it up."
"Negative","50/50 Fifties: The concept was an interesting one: half the album pop, half rock & roll. It turns out a miserable failure however because these ARE NOT the original recordings, but annoyingly mediocre remakes.Disc good for indoor frisbee only. (zero stars)"
"Negative","spider box: The spider on the spring was not glued on when i opened it. But what can you expect for $1.50. Maybe a 5 year old would think its funny, thats about it. Very cheap!!!!! Sorry Magic Mirror"
"Negative","Does not fit on my Hitatchi C10FC miter saw: I purchased the Hitatchi C10FC miter saw that did not come with extensions so I ordered these. The holes on the saw do not match the width of these extensions. The holes on the saw are much wider so I am not sure if this was a recent change to this model of saw or these extensions changed. I am still looking for the proper extensions for this saw. As the other reviews said, the extensions SHOULD have been included with this saw."
"Negative","Seems Like a Beta Version: Frequent lock-ups and total system crashes. This is the only (retail) software that I've experienced these problems with since the days of DOS. When it is running there are quite a few details that give the impression it is a beta version that was never completely finished before hitting the shelves.EA tech support operates under the ""no not us, somebody else"" method of problem solution."
"Positive","one of the best films of the 70's: Movies like this don't come around often enough. This is truly one of the best movies of the 70's. Yet it seems somewhat overlooked by the general populace. Most people have never heard even of it. So if it's your first time watch it then tell all your friends about it. The DVD is good quality as well. This is the best i've seen the movie look. I can't tell you after all the years of watching the vhs version then suddenly seeing it on dvd, I must've commented to my friend a hundred times during the movie on how good it looked."
"Positive","the best: better than any other book out there on anxiety. very illuminating- if you have anxiety, then read it. give to others around you so that they can try and see the world in the way that you do."
"Positive","DIVERSION SAFES: THIS IS A VERY COOL DIVERSION SAVE. MADE FROM A REAL BOOK. GREAT FOR CASH AND SMALLER ITEMS. GREAT PRODUCT!!!2-Book Safes, Diversion Safe made with a Real Book"
"Negative","IBM T30 Replacement Battery: I purchased this replacement battery with the idea that my orginal battery had lost some of its charging capacity. My maximum usable time unplugged was averaging around 20 minutes. After receiving my new battery and ensuring that it had a complete charge, I was very much dissappointed with the incremental improvement as I had only gained and additional 10 minutes.I would not recommend this product as the price far out ways the benefits.I can't believe that there is not an extended battery out there for these T30 models?"
"Negative","(YAWN!!!) Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: Bunch of BUNK!! Fell asleep part ways into it. Woke up during it, and sadly watched it to it's (glad it's finally over) end. Conclusion: 88 minutes of wasted life I'll never get back. If you wish to lose 88 minutes of your life, do yourself a favor and just sit outside watching your grass grow."
"Positive","Not a big deal for some: Just like all Ka-bars, great quality along with fit and finish. I just dont like a blade 7 or more inches to be 3/16 spine. That application is too thin for hard utility such a prying and thin blades stick when chopping. Personally for a hardcore utility I like 1/4 spine."
"Positive","Perfect: I got this specifically to use transferring data w/ my Polar RS400 and couldn't be happier. It's small, lightweight, and transfers the data w/o fail from the first time I used it. I read a few comments on the best way to transfer data with the RS400 and saw that the key is to put it directly by the dots above the O and A on the watch, and that was spot on. It only took a few days to arrive. I use Microsoft Vista and have had no problems. If you have a Polar RS400, this is what you want to use. The fact that it was so inexpensive was icing on the cake. Five stars all the way!"
"Positive","Great viewing!: I only really purchased this because I'd grown up in Yakima, Wa. when Dave Mahre was operating White Pass ski resort and his sons were winning medals in the olympics.I knew of the failed everest climb and was intrested.If you enjoy this kind of thing, get this dvd. It's good quality and interesting to watch.Dave and Mary Mahre-RIP."
"Positive","It's a great game!: I think it was a pretty good game. The graphics were great and the players were very realistic and they sometimes even talked! If you are into sports, this is the game for you!"
"Negative","Not a good Kindle Edition: I already know this book is interesting and I'm looking forward to read it, but I give it just 2 stars because this is a very poor kindle edition. I'm pro e-book reading all the way, that's I'm a bit disappointed to see an edition done with no care at all, without the maps and illustrations that you can find on the paper edition. These maps, figures, diagrams are vital to the full comprehension and enjoyment of the book; they must be in the kindle edition also! I hope they will release a new kindle edition soon and that we can download it again for free, because this one doesn't favour at all the pleasure of reading on a e-ink device."
"Positive","great space saver: I live in a small house, and my 2 bikes were in by kitchen. Now they are in my bedroom with room to spare. It was the perfect solution for me"
"Negative","Disappointed: The skates look made well but look different that pictured on Amazon. Also they were a whole size too big. I returned them and I am anxiously awaiting for my refund. They should not put pictures of the product up unless they look exactly like what they are shipping."
"Positive","Good product, but there are better sheet feeders: I bought this as an upgrade for my 1 person office. I went from an HP that did a great job with printing and scanning, but lacked a flatbed copy function to this. Generally, I'm pleased with the product, but the scanning function is a bit cumbersome and the sheetfeeder for the bypass tray does not always do a good job with envelopes."
"Negative","too much setup required: I never got far enough to play the game. It might be cool. It requires that you buy another connector for some tv's and you have to get to the back of your tv to make it work. Something, which for me, is not worth the large amount of effort that it would take me. They should let people know this before the purchase. Also this product will not work with LCD monitors or projection t.v.'s. Wish they would have told me that before I paid for it."
"Negative","Tool's conservative father: 2 1/2Not a huge Rush fan by any stretch, so I can't recall why this album was one of my choices to explore their more modern sound. The single title track was decent enough, but the album fails to create much traction with mediocre riffs and preachy lyrics making a persistent average quality even more self-consciously, over-the-hill-rock annoying. Good thing there are enough chops interspersed from preventing complete erosion of the senses."
"Positive","Triumphant: Whoa, what a great album. If you haven't heard this album or seen these guys live, then you got some serious catching up to do. Good straight-ahead rock with great lyrics and imagery throughout. There are also some good sing-along choruses. To keep a little variety on the album there are two cool epic songs that still continue to haunt me to this day and there a few slower songs in the vein of Oasis. These change of paces don't take anything away from the album but help point out the talents of this promising band. A well put together album that should be heard by any music fan. I'm hungry for the next one. Roll The Bones."
"Negative","Think Less Literally and More Mythically.: Lucifer can be defined in many ways...1) A supernatural being of evil. 2) The destroyer of worlds and bringer of light and fire. 3) A fallen angel. 4) A mythical figure used to generate fear for the purposes of religious conversion and control. 5) A celestial body such as a comet or meteor which fell to earth thousands of years ago causing widespread death and destruction... leading to a whole body of myth about an evil entity being cast down from heaven. 6) A mythical figure with positive attributes: The destroyer of illusion and bringer of enlightenment."
"Negative","Don't buy this program.: This program is the industry standard of what NOT TO DO. If you are not a web designer and just want to make a website there are better free programs out there than FrontPage and if you are planning on making websites for money I recomend Dreamweaver or the Dreamweaver Studio that comes with Fireworks also. FrontPage is to limiting and gave me nothing but trouble setting up sites. Run as far away from this product as you can and tell all your friends to do the same."
"Positive","Watch out! Here comes Beatrice!: I love trickster tales and this one, with a young girl in the starring role, is a treat. Set in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Beatrice decides she needs to help her mother by earning some money. There are only 2 options: lumbering and gambling with the giant who lives on the other side of the woods. Beatrice heads for the giant. Fortunately, she's a clever little girl; equally fortunately, the giant is not clever at all. She makes bets that she can pound on his front door harder than he can, that she can carry more water from the well than he can, that she can throw an iron bar farther than he can. And she wins! This story is going to get lots of reading in my Michigan school."
"Negative","Not great: I watched this with 4 year old who is in to Tom and Jerry right now. This had a hard time hold either of our attention..not the classic Tom and Jerry."
"Negative","Won't work with IPhone: I bought this thinking it would allow me to make ringtones for my iPhone. Based on the description, I thought this would work. What I received is an old version of the software (v 3.5) and it isn't compatable with iPhones. Fortunately it was only $10, but still a waste of money for what I thought I was buying."
"Positive","Great Fun: This is a favorite movie. Lots of fun. From the opening gun battle on. If you like old fashion westerns, you will like this. The Blue Ray version is well done and shows the scenary very well. The sound also benefits."
"Negative","Forgettable & disappointing & dumb: Young queer skyrocketing out of the closet develops an infatuation for a stupid loser/druggie/boy-whore, with predictable and stupid consequences. Both boys receive serious rue from the clue canoe.Sugar's not half as titillating or erotic as you might suppose based on their flesh comingling on the bed in the cover art. Instead it's a journey through the dark, dank caves of El Depresso.The boys are cute, and act competently; they might have been presented a better script, written by a sober writer. I don't want to see anymore movies about gays on drugs having lousy sex and sad lives."
"Positive","Davenport Does It Again!!: I like John Sanford, and I like his character Lucas Davenport. Davenport is definitely a womanizer, but he is also a ruthless sleuth. And, he will do anything to save a threatened victim. This novel follows the usual format, but with its own twists and turns, circumstances, etc. I like it. I have trouble putting the book down so that I can go to work (how dare work interfere?). I highly recommend John Sandford and his work."
"Positive","William Diehl-One of the best for Mystery and Suspense: Primal Fear. A believable story. It could happen.Aaron Stampler, accused of murdering a church Bishop plays to the reader's compassion with his stutter and country charisma. We think that Aaron is truly innocent, as we subconsciously help his defense attorney, Martin Vail, to get his client acquitted. But Aaron is not your typical country bumpkin. He is equipped with a clever psychotic mind that manipulates his attorney and the reader's mind and leads them on a trail of doubt of his guilt.The story is suspenseful and well written with great character development and a look into the mind of a person with multiple personality disorder. Diehl cleverly masks the truth through Primal Fear and keeps the reader turning pages until the real truth of the murder is revealed in an unsuspected ending."
"Positive","Tommy Hilfiger reversible watch: ....I am so happy with this buy....I found the blue red reversible awesome....and it goes either with casual or dressy outfits!...I would highly recommend this watch.."
"Negative","What Would Jesus Say?: In Luke 16 a rich man in hell asked Jesus if he could come back to life and warn his family. Jesus said, ""No, it won't make a difference."" Evidently Jesus was wrong. That is why He has allowed Bill Wiese to bring a warning from hell. It's your choice reader. Will you listen to Jesus or Bill, they can't both be right."
"Negative","Piece of JUNK: I thought this was a cool gadget, and it's exactly that. Just a cheaply made gadget!The performance is very poor. It drags across the fabric. During normal use, it dribbles water out the front drain spout. Even worse, if you turn off the iron and leave it horizontal, it drips out of the soleplate! I have come back to my ironing board to discover it standing in a puddle of water!As if the above problems weren't enough to hate it, after about 20 uses, the raising mechanism completely stopped working. As far as how it irons, I prefer my $30 iron over this one! It performs a lot better and works reliably."
"Negative","Ugly Projects: I respectfully disagree with the other reviewers. I found nothing in this book that I would knit. The emphasis is on home decorating items, such as pillows. I sent it back the same day it came. Blessings to Amazon.com for a great return policy."
"Negative","Not worth the money: I had ordered this to consolidate a couple of my watch winders. It was broken within a few weeks. At this point, it is only a dust collector that holds 2 non automatic watches. I guess you get what you pay for."
"Positive","One of the most incredible musical journeys in history!: The lost opera of the Amazon was found some years ago in the Bolivian Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos. Like in the film Mission, the history of the opera depicts the incredible history of the work done by the missionaires and the people of the Amazon. The opera shows the classic combat between good and evil among angels, demons and the jesuits. The most incredible part of all this is that it is likely that most of the opera and some extra songs recorded in this cd had been composed and executed by the Chiquitanos and Moxos Indians after the Jesuit Expulsion from the Americas in 1767. Most incredibly, the paperwork which contained thousands of musical works, were copied during 200 hundred years by the Bolivians, to whom belong now this treasure."
"Negative","Complete Disappointment: I bought this to replace the faithful Wearever Popcorn Pumper that I took to college in 1982, that finally died last week. The new popper is a complete waste of money. It pops maybe half the kernels, blowing the rest out unpopped along with the popped ones. The butter melter is inconvenient, and the components get very hot.I'm sure there's a better popper out there - I know 25 years ago there was! I'm going shopping again. Don't waste your time and money like I did!"
"Negative","Price is absolutely ridiculous!: I was not lucky enough to see this movie when it was on TV in 1980 and I suppose I never will because I can't afford $59.95-$115.36 for a VHS tape! This is absolutely ridiculous! I wouldn't be able to sleep at night taking advantage of people like this!"
"Positive","Makes lubricating chores a snap: Quite the useful tool if you have farm or construction equipment that needs frequent lubrication. Dual batteries lessen the chance that you will run out of power in the middle of a job. Drop-in cartridges make quick work of refilling the gun. Somewhat heavy but well-balanced. About the only shortfall is that the grease connector, as provided, is a straight-on style and may not be able to reach some deeply buried fittings such as on my backhoe. Angled connectors are available as an after-market item."
"Negative","Disappionted: I bought this movie thinking I would see lesbian sex (because I like that) but I was disappointed-there were a few pretty women, but I saw NO good sex senes and a stupid story. I think this movie was a waste of my money."
"Negative","Entertaining trash: Produced by Roger Corman STRIPPED TO KILL is a stylishly filmed, trashily entertaining thriller. The story is pretty basic: Cop Officer Cody Sheehan (Kay Lenz) goes undercover as a stripper to catch the killer behind the deaths of several of its dancers; and soon finds she enjoys stripping. There is one creepy spectator in particular who is singled out as the suspect, could it be him? The strippers all use the usual creative names like Dazzle, Brandy, Cinnamon, Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail who go about their biz while Lenz waits for the killer to stand up and pull his peter on her. Anyhow there are far worse movies out there. Like ZIPPERFACE."
"Negative","rehash of secondary ideas from original series stories, poor script, clunking, a kitchen sink, a mess: strong fan here while the series was on, at least till season 5 or 6. even own a lot of the dvds, and haul them out once or twice a year and rewatch with much enjoyment and appreciation. this film was a worst episode stretched to film length time limit. rehash plot themes (organs, experiments, visions), poor script, clunking, an unusual religious/clerical abuse/same sex relationship/russian psychopaths angle. kind of a mess. can't anyone say no to chris carter? or at least lock him in a room till he comes up with a resolution of the fundamental themes/arcs of the show that has the insight, substance, and flair of years 1 to 3? if not, enough is enough. long live californication and bleak house!"
"Negative","Love the Book, Hate the Shipping: The book took FOREVER to get here. I mean like, weeks. It was in good condition though."
"Negative","Cicero: A Shallow Summarization: I bought this book after devouring the ""Masters of Rome"" series by Colleen McCullough. I had hope for a more in depth, factual, biography of a figure that lived through many of the same events as McCullough covered. What I got instead was a cliff notes summary of the events of the man's life, with ridiculously few of biographical details, and far less information than the historical novels of McCullough. In fact, with a few exceptions, ""Cicero"" could have been written using McCullough's books as the SOLE SOURCE. I am not implying any plagiarism or anything of the kind, merely noting that a set of books marketed as historical fiction contain just as much useful information as a purportedly more serious and in depth work. I've yet to read other bios of Cicero yet, but skip this one."
"Positive","Father Ted collection: It will be the perfect gift for my husband. We were introduced to Father Ted while on a recent trip to Ireland and will enjoy watching the collection. Thank you for having it available!"
"Negative","Big Ol' Letdown: I started this book thinking it was gonna be good, campy Southern fun. Instead I got a lame, predictable plot that wasn't even up to snuff for a Lifetime movie script. Stay away from this book if you have even a scintilla of intelligience and/or a fondness for Southern fiction."
"Negative","Soundkase iPod clip: Don't waste your $$. The iPod slips right out of this case. The lip it sits on is not even level, but slanted, and unless you have your iPod packed in a fat cover, you'll lose it."
"Negative","Poorly Engineered: Simply put, the screen which is held in place by a snap in feature did not stay in place. I could not even try the shaver to see if it was any good."
"Negative","Do Not Recommend: I was a little worried about purchasing this set because I had read the reviews from previous buyers saying there were problems with the disks. These reviews, however, were from around 2006. I was thinking that it didn't make sense that a product would still be sold to customers, 6 years later, knowing that it was faulty. Well I did not get through the entire series, but still came across two faulty disks from two separate seasons. The one episode would not play and all and just returned to the menu. The other, skipped and froze so much that it was not worth watching. It is very unfortunate that this problem has been known for so long, but yet the product is still being sold."
"Positive","Amazing book!!: Once again, Eric Victorino's artistic talent is put into this great free-verse poetry book. I couldn't put it down and I finished it the day I received it in the mail. All of the poems are awesome but the one I found the most interesting was ""It's A People Business."" All of the experiences in his life, personally and with his band, come to life in this book. Please check it out! It's worth every penny!!"
"Negative","Ridiculous: is the conductor being paid like a taxi driver? The qucker he reaches the end of the journey the more he gets? If the orchestra played this any faster you would'nt even know what it was. And I thought Solti rushed things along !! There are much better small orchestra performances than this one, let alone full scale orchestra performances. This is ridiculous."
"Negative","Doesn't get as hot as it should: At first I thought this was a great product. If you only make cheese fondue it is great. The pot is very easy to clean although it could be easier if it were dishwasher safe.The problem I've had with mine is that it doesn't get beyond about 320 degrees. The dial goes up to 400 but even after waiting for 30 minutes for it to heat up, it only got up to 323 degrees and wouldn't go any further. So if you want to use this for oil for a steak fondue it won't do the job well.I know these kinds of appliances have to have a short cord and also a break-away cord but this is ridiculous. Touch the darn thing and the cord falls free. Very frustrating if you have a lot of people trying to use it for fondue. People kept telling me that the cheese was getting ""hard"" because the cord had fallen off, again. Next time I'd get a pot that had a thermometer built in, don't rely on the heat setting dial."
"Positive","Great multitool: It has most of the tools needed when out riding. I carry one my Giant mountain bike and I've needed it twice already. Very good quality solid build and compact."
"Positive","replacement: Needed to replace my original...this is a bit lighter, a bit narrower than the original. Seems to work just fine."
"Negative","Contradictory and insulting: I got this book after multiple people said it was invaluable. I found the tone to be sarcastic and judgmental. I was also confused by some of the contradictory advice: she says she's appalled by how many people let their toddlers dominate the home and call the shots. Then, when apparently asked how to deal with a kid who throws food, she replies, ""He's not hungry, Luv. Let him play for a half hour and then try again."" What are you doing tonight? Clearly, I'm supposed to be catering dinner every 30 minutes until my 2-yr old feels like eating."
"Negative","Great Idea.: This Squirrel feeder has a great idea behind it but it doesn't take into consideration one thing and that's the squirrels will eat the wood to get to the peanuts. I've had it for a couple of months and its destroyed. I went out to Petsmart and bought the same Idea in Metal,it will last longer."
"Positive","Best small clock ever: I've had this in black for about 15 years and only changed the battery one...I kid you not....it's become a running joke between my husband and me because he's had a half dozen clocks poop out on him in the same time frame. When I went back to Walgreen's a few years ago to get another for another room they no longer had them. Now it's my grandson's favorite toy, and he keeps taking it off the nightstand so I'm here to pick up a couple more...hope they're as good as the original!"
"Positive","Great ride on toy: For a child that is between the ages of 3-5 and less than 60lbs this is a great toy. A child younger than 3 may have trouble understanding how to steer using the ""bulldozer"" style controls but my 3 year old figured it out very quickly and loves it. It has 3 different buttons for making different firing noises with flashing lights which the kids love.Great toy."
"Positive","Not as good as first, but still good: Nicholis Cage is back for a sequal to National Treasure. This time he's trying to prove that his great grandfather wasn't involved with the assasination of our president Abraham Lincoln. They also discover along the way that there is a treasure involved. That (of course this has to happen) makes someone else want the same treasure. With his dad, Riley, and his girlfriend, who will come out on top?I enjoyed the sequal to National Treasure. It's full of action again and has a good plot to it. However, the first one (as always) is clearly a better movie. The ""bad guys"" in the second movie don't appear to be ""on the chase"" as bad as Eon and his gang in the first movie. Sure they want the treasure pretty bad, but it doesn't seem that they want it as much as Eon did.Overall, though this is a great sequal to the first National Treasure. If you enjoyed watching the first one, then I recommend getting the sequal."
"Negative","Good for knives other than from ""fine cutlery"" lines.: Sabatier 10-slot Wood Knife Block is not for you if you own a quality French-made collection of fine Sabatier knives from their Provence or Grand Chef series. First of all the block is not compatible with high-end lines of knives because the slots for knives are not wide (thick) enough for blades to fit in. Secondly, there is no way this block could ever be sold for anything close to its list price. The [price] price is more like the correct &#65533;regular&#65533; price for this item. The quality of this block made out of mismatched by color and grain &#65533;two-by-four&#65533; pieces of pine does not justify a list price higher than ten dollars. I will be returning this item back to Amazon because block&#65533;s quality is not up to par for Sabatier name it carries. My new out of the box block has dents and scratches on its surface; even Sabatier logo on the front is crooked."
"Positive","she loses a star for the slow beginning.: Aside from that, it was a rip-roaring read. I literally could not put it down - I was reading while I got dressed in the morning.My problems with this book were that it took so very long to get started, in fact I was 100pp in before I felt the hero and heroine made any real connection. (It was at least 45 pages before they even met) Once they did though, things didn't slow down until I turned the last page.Ms. Wilson created very real characters in the midst of out-of-this-world drama. She got into the head of a single mother with all of her contradictions and worries admirably. The kids were great (and I don't even really like kids in romances). Our hero was wonderful in how he related to women.I just wish the book hadn't taken so long to get into the meat of the story."
"Negative","disappointing: Disappointing in overall quality. The watch looks ok,but is basically an overpriced cheap watch."
"Positive","A Legend of Santa and His Brother Fred: A VERY GOOD BOOK FOR CHILDREN OF ALL AGES. THIS STORY IS A GOOD START OF THE LEGEND OF A TRUE STORYI LIKE IT AND YOU WILL TOO. GIVE IT A CHANCE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED. WILLIAM WILLIAMSON JR. LUPTON MI."
"Positive","Works pretty good: This gizmo works pretty good for simple hole drilling in round stock. It is a bit flimzy and not for precise holes."
"Positive","Teachers NEED to read this book... So do LD kids.: As a smart kid with ADD, I BEG for all you teachers out there to read this book. I was always one of those exuberant, curious, confident kids when I was little... Until I entered kindergarten. Then I became one of the ""dumb kids."" I was eventually diagnosed with ADD and put on Ritalin, which did absolutely nothing for my self esteem. (""Oh great. I'm so stupid that I need DRUGS to do well in school?"") To be concise, the school system ate me alive because it simply wasn't set up very well for kids with different learning styles. It wasn't until I hit high school and took an IQ test (and scored 147, mind you) that I actually believed I was an intelligent human being. See? Your LD students aren't necessarily stupid. They're probably just gravely misunderstood. This book lets you see things through their eyes. Trust me. It helps."
"Negative","Better options out there: While the case functions well and the blue color is nice, there are a few drawbacks. First, (and this is my fault for not noticing this) is that the connection on the case is not micro or mini USB. It has a special cable (included) that uses a standard A type plug on both ends. So I can't use on of the dozens existing cables that I use for all other USB drives.The second thing I don't like is how the drive sits in the case. There is no way to secure the drive or have it rest on something int the case. It just plugs into the connector and then slides in the drive. It's not a tight fit so the can wiggle back and forth in the housing. I wouldn't trust it to transport regularly.So it gets the job done but there are better options.Plus it didn't help that it took well over a month for delivery."
"Positive","the spiriti catches youy and you fall down: it was recommended to me by a medical student at harvard, where they teach a freshman class in patient /doctor relations. i found the book fascinating in its exposing the cullture of the hmongs. i had never heard of this group of people but found it it hard to put down after i started the book. it is an eye opening experience in dealing with foreign cultures and i see why it is a required 1st year course at harvard. i highly recoomend it."
"Positive","The Best Books I've Ever Read: These books are inspirational as well as life-changing. I recommend them to anyone and everyone"
"Positive","A thoughtful gift for the Titanic buff on your list: Twenty-four nice, glossy Titanic-related photos on heavy card stock. Some concise, accurate text to accompany them. A thoughtful and inexpensive gift for the Titanic buff on your list."
"Positive","wonderful stuff: What a great product! It's true overnight relief for dipaer rash. But I only recommend that you use Desitin the original, not the creamy one, since it's far more effective."
"Negative","strong chemical odor/ sizes not consistent: Softspots Women's Trinidad Slip-OnLast year I ordered a size 9 in this shoe. It was a too big but I used a sole insert and a heel pad which solved the problem. The shoes wear well and are comfortable. This year I ordered the same shoe style in size 8 1/2 thinking it would fit perfectly. It was so tight I could not get it on. I returned the shoes and reordered a size 9 which fit but are very snug. These shoes have a strong chemical odor. I have aired them for a week with no improvement. The entire closet literally fills with this odor and I now air them in the garage. I may have to return these shoes too."
"Positive","A Great Place To Begin: This book contains lots of information for the beginner, but I have found myself returning to it time and time again. Most people say that its a great place to begin, but I think its also a great place to return too."
"Positive","Different than the Original, yet the same...: Your typical Remake of modern times...Not as good as the Original...A contemporary version of the the Original that the world could have done without... it was however nice to see Julianne Hough dance her ass off!"
"Negative","So what!: Any book discouraging uninformed voters to vote against Hillary is worthy of ink.Although, I believe it is mostly speculative.So what!It is about time the left gets a taste of their own medicine.Two things in the book that I agree with:1. Hillary is power hungry.2. Hillary is transforming herself into a centrist.If the reader believes nothing else but these two points it was worth the speculative ink.I gave it one star so the lefties will read it! Kiss Kiss! Liberals."
"Positive","A brilliant debut: I was never really much of a fan of Creed, although i did like some of their music. After seeing a commercial for this album i decided to give it a try. I was totally blown away by what i heard. New singer Myles Kennedy puts so much conviction and passion into his singing. His vocal range is unbelievable. And the remaining Creed members sound really tight playing their respective parts. Mark Tremonti really shines on this album, both by his playing and writing. If you're a fan of rock, buy this album. You won't be disappointed."
"Positive","Great Fantasy Read: i highly recommend it. I ""bought"" the free first book and plan to purchase the rest of the series. It has magic, monsters, knights, elves, ogres, and so much more. Fast paced read. I love it."
"Negative","unimaginably hard to listen to: I don't even know where to begin, but this was without a doubt the worst CD I ever bought. I own over 100 blues CD's of various artists A to Z, and this one is the only one I wanted to throw in the trash before I even got through with it. You can not even get to hear the guitar because this mans voice is just absolutely aggravating. I can't even describe it. Is it screaming? But to tell you how I feel, I would rather listen to a jackhammer, or fog horn, going off repeatedly in my living room before I would ever play this CD again. I have to admit, I am no authority here, and I could be quite wrong about this CD, but take my advice for what its worth. And definitely buy something else."
"Positive","Stong Fathers, Strong Daughters: My husband and I label this book as a ""must read"" for any daddy raising a daugther! We never realized the impact a father has on setting the course for his daughter's life until reading this book. It heightens the motivation to be that special man in your daughter's eyes. The author had a wonderful way of touching our hearts and opening our eyes to the role played by the father."
"Positive","Good product despite deceptive verbiage on box: I got the iMic as a higher-quality alternative to the cheap sound card on my XP laptop. For this purpose, it has worked great for me for the price. It has improved sound quality for both output (PC audio to stereo speakers) and input (I record voice from a cheap microphone for my work). To boot, since it's USB, I hooked it up to a USB 2.0 hub, so now I only need one wire to connect my laptop to all its peripherals.However, I agree with other reviewers that it's not quite a ""pro"" product -- it doesn't have the controls and connectors pro sound people are likely to want. And I also agree that the box's promise that it ""easily turns old records and tapes into mp3s or CDs"" is exaggeration. Of course, you need a sound card, such as the iMic, for that job, but in any circumstance creating those digital files will be a big labor.I'd recommend this if your basic goals don't go beyond just getting better sound."
"Positive","Fast!: Great printer, fast, low maint, large paper tray, rarely jams. Only drawback is there's no LCD screen so when there is a problem you have to translate blinking light messages to figure out what's wrong."
"Positive","Could be better, but a good book about a despot: Gives a very unbiased account of Pinochets life and times. The author talks about the state terrorism of the DNIA(Chilean Intelligence) against foes at home and abroad. Probably the best unbiased literary acccount of Pinochet and his despotic military Junta."
"Negative","nonsense renewed: This book is not about ""a revolutionary psychotherapeutic treatment"" as advertised. It's a throwback to the nonsense beliefs of the Dark Ages. Demon possession??? Give me a break! A past life affecting present behavior?? Impossible, unless you have a memory of your previous beliefs and values! This is a book of fiction for the gullible, and/or religious fundamentalists."
"Negative","Worst design and execution I have seen: This was the first gas can I have bought in years. The salesman demonstrated briefly how the system works. I got home and neither I nor my son can make the can work correctly without gas seeping out and running all over our hands and the equipment. We tried several times and then went to their website (as referenced on the can) only to find out that the videos there don't match the products they sell. Our mechanism for pouring was for more difficult to use and far less stable than what their video showed. Bottom line, both cans go back tomorrow. Horrid product. Run away!!"
"Positive","This is EXCELLENT!: I'd like to say, that at first, I thought this would be a ""B"" album that had been shelved. WRONG! This ia a first class, ""A"" collection of recordings. Diana Ross sounds great...the vocals are perfect. The whole production made me want to play this very loud; and I do. I've played this about 7 times now in my car....and it just gets better and better. Great album!"
"Negative","No more confusion: I bought this book thinking it was Brandon Boyd of Incubus. partly because the book is being sold with Incubus CD's but after receving the book and reading it I was not too sure. not to say its not a good book its okay, just a little mushy. Than after going to the book signing on May 12th some girls brought this book for Brandon to sign and he did not even know this book existed. so I just wanted to let everyone know as to not be confused this is NOT a Brandon Boyd of Incubus book.And thank you to Brandon for clearing things up!!!"
"Negative","Coleman 70 quart ice chest.: The coleman 70 quart Ice Chest does a good job. But like Igloo and others the hinges break very easily, poor vinyl or plastic material. In Texas Academy Stores usually have parts but Coleman parts are a low priority because Igloo is King. You will find plenty of Igloo parts even in other stores Hardware Stores, Target Stores, Walmart, but no Coleman parts. So forget buying a Coleman Cooler once the hinges break it is over. Go to Coleman's web site they don't even show a 70 quart cooler. Try and phone them and they don't even know what you are talking about and I provided the product number. I just gave up."
"Positive","Great: This CD is very good, if you are a Olsenfan. Some songs aren't sang by them but the cd is almost great."
"Negative","Did get what I purchased: The book I received is not the one I ordered. Though it has the same name as the one I ordered it was an older version (10 years old) most of the coding examples used in the book is out of date.This will be the last time I buy a book from you."
"Negative","Beware!: This CD is missing 7+ minutes of the program as listed, i.e., the final two movements of the ""Crown of India Suite"". What a bummer!"
"Negative","I've should readed the reviews before...: in 4 years this has been the worst election that I've made. I love John Williams music, and like everybody thoughed that I will received all the original soundtrack from 3 films; not chabby and terrible versions from electronic music, seriously STAY AWAY FROM THIS! if you don't wanna loose some bucks!, this is outrageous!"
"Positive","I've used it before and I'll keep using it!: I've used this product in Caracas, Venezuela and I found it to be a very good product that says exactly what it promises. i got a chance to buy it on e-bay in Miami and I'll use it as long as I can get it."
"Negative","Lovely in prose, but dull in content: I was anxious to read this book. It had been given rave reviews when it debuted and I was postitive that I would like it. Wrong, I will admit I was wrong! I found it dull and tedious. It seemed to repeat itself and the twists in the story appeared calculated by the author. I could almost hear her saying ""Let's make it go this way now."" The book is a quick read and the author's use of language at times is lovely, but those are the only positive comments I can make concerning this boring book."
"Negative","Worthless: Pretty much my dog just shoves this thing off the couch and lays there anyway. There is no rubber or anything on the bottom to help prevent it moving."
"Positive","Impactful on every level: This film has an impact on me on every level: story, characters, visuals, action, cinematography, atmosphere.I cared about Theo and his ex-wife, the girl and her child, Jasper and his wife. I cared what happened to them. As far as film-making goes, this movie is a powerhouse. It's got some of the most intense action scenes I've ever seen filmed, and several of the best ones done in one continuous shot, which has the effect of making them seem all the more brutal and immediate."
"Negative","Will never order again: I have bought several things from amazon and have never been so disappointed. I have to this day not received the memory card. I will never order another thin.g from your site"
"Positive","welcome addition to my mini lathe: First off, the extension bed is great. From time of delivery to time of putting the bed extension to use was about 30 minutes. Took a little tweeking to get the two pieces aligned but went relatively smooth. Second issue, the packaging for transit sucks. Inside the box they designed the padding poorly (expanded styrofoam). One end had a large block of foam surrounding it the other had little padding at all and in turn one of the plastic foot pads was broken. I was able to make the repair in short order but this should never have happened. A full block of foam padding at both ends would have prevented this."
"Negative","Worst movie to date!!!!: I just love a good interracial movie. This movie played the race card, which any good IR movie will do... but the also played the Teens-gotta-have-sex-all-of-the-time card. It also played the Gotta-get-high-&-drunk and outcasts-are-the-coolest-people card. I would rather get one pap smear per hour for the rest of my life than watch this movie one more time!!! The only thing the main character did was act like a freaking baby and the male lead, to say he was so smart, was so stupid. He felt he had to clean up all of her messes and in effect almost screwed up his own future. Her father repeatedly tells him that she will (but he won't listen). I waited throughout this entire movie for it to get good..... and it did... in the last 10 seconds. Don't waste your time or money on this one, unless you just loved the movie When a Man loves a Woman (which I also hate)!"
"Negative","Never ending: I acutally spoke to Robert Jordan at a book signing at the time this book came out. At that point I asked him:""how many books there were going to be in the series?"" 7 to 9 he says, not quite sure yet.""about the plot - do you have it worked out?"" Making it up as I go.My heart sank when I got these answers and it probably explains why the series has got so bad from this point onwards. I stopped reading this series when I heard these answers, because I knew it wasn't going to end up well plotted out and was just drifting on and on.This may explain a few mysteries as to why this series has declined in quality so badly. He's got 2 stars because the books were still readable at this time - but there was/is no end in sight still."
"Positive","Catch Bull at Four: Yusuf or Cat Stevens he is the greatest ever. I've been listening to him for 35 years and am very excited he's back."
"Positive","16.5 - INCH DRILL PRESS: For it's price, this is a good heavy duty drill press with features only found on much more expensive equipment. Assembly was fairly easy except that I had to use my tap and die set to clean out several threaded holes and the machine screws to assemble the table and related components. Casting on the table is poor with edges rough enough to cut me and metal under grooves in table with voids. I'm very surprised that Delta does not have better quality control on this."
"Positive","Love the feel of this bowl: This bowl is the first bowl that I have ever used in my life that fits so well in my hands and is a pleasure to use because of that fact. I love the way it feels and I would recommend this bowl because it feels so good and fits so nicely into your hands which makes using it a pleasure. I am so glad that I decided to purchase this bowl. I highly recommend it."
"Negative","MX 310: The mice broke just under 12month of using it. As many said the left click is the most part where people use and easy to break."
"Positive","The Magic School Bus Makes a Rainbow: My granddaughter loves this book also, she loves talking and reading about rainbows and stars"
"Negative","cleans but breaks: Cleans well, but after several uses, with tender loving care and following all directions, small parts started to fall off or crack. Then it was repaired improperly at the repair shop that the warranty required. Just not built to last very long. Used 8 times, and went to the repair shop 4 times."
"Negative","So disappointed: I ordered this book over one year ago because of the rave reviews. I tried two recipes in it. The lemon pound cake was dense, too lemony and just all around not to my or my boyfriend's liking. The vanilla cupcakes were so, so. I make exceptional desserts from recipes in other books and articles and people have raved about them. I also follow instructions precisely. However, in this case I know that the recipes are not good (at least to me) and the baker is not the problem. I guess I just don't have a taste for the recipes in this book. I am almost afraid to try another recipe because the two others have been so disappointing.Perhaps this book is for someone who has different tastes from the norm. However, I like decadent desserts. So far I'm thoroughly disappointed and wished I hadn't purchased the book."
"Positive","Charming book about a charming (if a bit noisy) subject: This is one of the finest pet books ever written; it doesn't sound ""canned,"" as so many books on pet care do. The author's enthusiasm for these most enthusiastic of pets comes through. He gives enough anecdotal information to hold the reader's interest but backs it up with solid facts and how-to's on the care, taming, training and breeding of halfmoon conures. For instance, he is very honest about the noise factor: dwarf parrots of all species can be raucous! The chapter on other popular dwarf parrots is necessarily abbreviated but informative enough to ""do"" until the reader could find a book on his particular pet. (Bates and Busenbark's PARROTS AND RELATED BIRDS, recommended in this book, would be an excellent choice for that reader). All in all, a delightful read."
"Negative","WHeww! It's OVER!: This book has about 186 pages. At page 156 I started counting down .. 30 pages left, 29 pages left, 28 pages left ...Story about homeless white kid making friends w/ black kids in the ghetto, and the racist white kids who taunt them.Reminds me of the 70's.Yawn."
"Negative","She's come undone was much better.: It is slow to get into. Feel She's come undone was much more interesting. Almost gave up on it 2 or 3 times but did manage to finish it"
"Positive","I'm buying another one!: I bought this pad by accident. Boy, am I glad I did! This pad is so soft and cushiony that it made it easier to transition my daughter from the ""family bed"" to her crib (in only two nights)! When it was time to wash it, I used one of my other pads (the one I was originally trying to buy) for one night. She absolutely hated it! I had to put it back on the crib before she would go to sleep (yes, it was clean by then)! The bottom is plastic (or vinyl?), so make sure you dry it on low. Anyway, now I'm buying another one, just in case..."
"Positive","Killing fields: stretching and easily to read readingJack Reachers adventures are just as good as this from James Bond I look forward already to the next book"
"Positive","Why I rated this book with 4 stars...: If you're looking for more serious information and training for SAR dogs these is a GREAT book. It's clear, well written with serious information on what a SAR dog AND handler must be like. It takes you from step 1 (choosing a puppy) to having a full operational SAR dog (radio communication, handler's, training step by step, etc).So, why 4 stars and not 5? This book isn't very open to different techniques, methods, dogs or info from around the world. For wood search it's very good. If you want info on avalanche or disaster search it's not very complete."
"Negative","These mustaches tried to kill me!: These mustaches were enchanted with evil magic. They tried to kill me. Literally. The also attacked my friends and family. I couldn't get rid of these for days.The magic also probably lowered their quality- the fake hair fell out and got all over everything.The one really good thing about these mustaches was that they were REALLY REALLY REALLY big; your giant friends can use these."
"Positive","Intro to cyberpunk: This short story collection is a good introduction to Gibson and the cyberpunk genre which deals with technology and those using it in the near future. The book is inexpensive, the stories are short, what do you have to lose?"
"Negative","Scary as the Hell that is called Mars: The music on Mythodea was interesting at first. Then in the midst of the ""aria"" type-movement, it began scaring me greatly. In fact it scared me like the Hell - and i do not believe in Hell, because in fact, ""Mars aint t he kind of place to raise your kid, in fact it's cold as Hell: well that's what Elton/Bernie sings. Although, i was kinda kewl with this sort of thing. I was at once startled and chilled to the spine, when my Mother busted down the down and found me lying on the floor wearing headphones, with the amp cranked up ! This album is the worst and at yet leaps the kind of faith, the kind that only Evangelos Pappathannisou, could dream people might enjoy ! Whatever he's on, I would love to have that in pill form. Love, Douglas :)"
"Positive","Love It, Love It, Love It !!!: Purchased this in Jan 2011. Am currently in my 4th week of the program and very impresseed thus far. I did read the reviews before purchasing and confirmed I could pass the fitness test (great look by the other reviewers). Already seeing and feeling changes visibly and on the scale. I chose to start with the lean program and will likely go doubles the second time around and classic the third. Definitely recommend!!!"
"Positive","Mancini at His Best: This is a great CD. Excellent sound quality and the difficult to find Audrey Hepburn version of ""Moon River""."
"Negative","Waste of Money: My children were not able to wear this costume for Halloween. The costume said that it was for sizes 0-6 months. However, the costumes were gigantic! There is no way that any baby who is under 6 months old would fit into this costume. It looked like it was sized for a toddler. This ended up being a huge waste of money since I had to get other Halloween costumes for my children to wear."
"Positive","Greenies are OK if your dog does not gobble them down: I have done a ton of research on the Greenie problem. After all the research and speaking with my holistic vet regarding the matter - I have come to the conclusion that if the dog is not properly chewing up the bone, then there's problems. My lab takes her time with them and chews each bite completely. My vet recommended ""Flossies"" for an alternative if a dog is not chewing the greenies well enough. I tried ""Flossies"", but they are expensive and gave my lab the nasty poops - sorry to be so graphic. In the end - I am back to greenies and they now make a new, more digestible version.Always be present when giving any dog a bone - I have the instructions for the doggie Heimlich Maneuver on my frig just in case!!!!!!!!"
"Negative","Dreadful: Just dreadful. didn't even make it home and I was dissapointed. I ended up playing my Clay CD instead."
"Positive","GREAT BEGINNER GUITAR: This we bought for our oldest son 3 years ago. It really has a nice sound to it and the combination of the amp and guitar for the price is perfect!! It has really held up from daily playing."
"Positive","Great Product: I have been using Zone Alarm since last October and it has performed brilliantly. I have only owned a computer for about 4 years and went with Norton Initially, I guess because it was the most popular. I was infected at least three times with spyware, viruses, etc... Of the three infections Norton only detected one, the other two I used a free internet scanner to detect. Not too mention Norton used huge amounts of computer resources to operate. Since buying Zone Alarm, my computer has ran much, much better. I have had no infections(granted I am a little more computer savvy), and Zone Alarm is constantly blocking access to my computer. It is highly customizable and easy to use. There are far more features available and I dont even use half of whats available. I would highly recommend Zone Alarm, no matter what your level of computer experience!!!"
"Negative","pump failed to soon!!: Pump failed in less than 2 years, 20 months to be more accurate. My basement got flooded"
"Positive","darn good: while not as good as the first (a hard level to match) dual matrix is a great addition to anyone's anime library.Armitage and the big guy are married and have a daughter, and live with aliases. throw in some political intrigue some ""what does it mean to be human"" mumbo jumbo and some oh-so-tight leather strap clothing/BDSM outfits and that is the movie for you. i would tell you more, but then i would really be giving everything away.btw, the english voice actors are different."
"Negative","Not PG anymore since they put all the profanity back in: The Netflix ""Romancing the Stone"" had 10+ G*damms in the first 50 minutes before we gave up. Why is this DVD rated PG when they put back all the profanity they took out to get a PG rating for the movie theaters? There is no warning in the product description that it is no longer PG."
"Positive","Excellent and Balanced Study of Wartime Incarceration: Lane Ryo Hirabayashi has done a great service to the Asian American Studies community with his study of the life of Tamie Tsuchiyama. Through her own words, Hirabayashi captures her struggles as a researcher coping with the daily exigencies of life in an American concentration camp. Central to his work is the relationship that Tsuchiyama shared with then JERS (Japanese Evacuation Resttlement Study) head, Dorothy Thomas. Not only is this meticulously researched, but poignantly recounted through Hirabayashi's deft analysis. I can't wait to assign this book to my own students."
"Negative","Drops 15% of all calls: Horrible phone - drops at least 15% of all calls, doesn't ring all the time, software glitchy and crashes. I have had two separate v220s with the same problems. Don't get motorola. I miss my old grayscale denon candybar from sprint..."
"Positive","A must read for student's of U.S. foreign policy: Full of important historical information and interesting tidbits of trivia, The Barbary Wars provides an excellent overview of the foreign policy challenges faced by a young and idealistic United States in exporting its revolutionary (and necessary) economic ideas. It also explores the often difficult job of making good foreign policy decisions in the face of seemingly unrelated, but nonetheless complicating, domestic politics. Lambert offers a work that should be viewed as important by historians and contemporary political scientists."
"Positive","The Housing Bubble Has Burst, But This Book Is Still Relevant: I am in the process of obtaining my Real Estate License so I made this purchase, it is an interesting book. The book is ""copyright 2006"" a time when Las Vegas, NV and Phoenix, AZ could do no wrong so they seem to put a lot of emphasis on these two markets. We all know these were two of the most hard hit areas when it came to foreclosures. Never the less, this book is a good investment, particularly on Amazon where I purchased it for a penny. Kendra is a woman of faith and principle and I intend to follow her formula to ""risk and grow rich."""
"Positive","This book is excellent, but its pace is to fast.: This books pace is way to fast, and the explantions are to hurried. The author starts on one subject and the quickley proceeds to another with little segway in between. Besides this week point it is an excellent book. It forces the reader to think, really think about what our goverment is hiding from its citizens. What dark forces are behind this project and does it affect us and our freedom in this country. A must have for anyone who wants to learn more and develope his own opinion."
"Negative","Not acceptable: I was quite surprised to learn that the filter is not designed to be water sealed. While the installation direction clearedly says that it is required to apply Teflon tape, it still feels like a 19th centry technolodgy. On the bright side, a small scroll of the said tape is included in the package.The installation is easy and simple. Unfortunately, when we attached our shower head back and tested it for the first time, the filter could not sustain the water pressure and broke into two pieces. Luckily the only casualty was our light bulb.Item returned without much of discussion. I hope this company's got a good return policy."
"Negative","REBA NEEDED TO WAIT A WHILE LONGER....: If this is what a new CD from Reba sounds like then I can tell you it aint no different than any of her last 4 releases. Its all the same. Only the lyrics are different!! She should have waited a little longer and come back with something that had a little more substance to it. None of the songs on this are even worth mentioning."
"Positive","I love them all.: Sigh. For the longest time I was drifting in the quagmire that is R.L. Stine. Then came the light. I have read all the books Miss Lisa J. Smith has written (except her first 2, and the Vampire Diaries) and the Night World series has just topped off all the good things I already knew. Her writing is excellent, nicely paced, and you NEVER 1)get bored 2) get disgusted by all the mushy stuff, because it is not 'mushy' it is beautifully written and not overly flowery.I have only one grudge.......WHATEVER HAPPENED TO STRANGE FATE? IT'S AS IF IT NEVER EVEN EXISTED! AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT NOTICED? ........................"
"Positive","Helping Us Understand the Obvious--Once He Makes it Obvious: Every once in a while someone explains something so well that you can't figure out why you didn't see it before. Gladwell does this. I've read and studied decision making quite a bit, and most of it made a lot of sense and was based on good research. None of it--with the exception of one author--however, explained for me the reason of why people seem to ""jump"" to decisions, without following the ""rules."" This is a great book! (The other author who explains things this well is Gary Klein (Sources of Power, Intuition at Work), whom Gladwell discusses)."
"Negative","Sharp digital camcorder: The first time I ordered it, it was defective and a pain to try and return, then the replacement took too long."
"Positive","gomez only shine on this debut: ""bring it on"" is uncomparable to ""liquid skin"",i'm afraid gomez's talent has used up.in this suprising good debut,the mix of vocals between a young & old sound is cool & i think it's better than beta band's""three eps"""
"Positive","Nice surprise.: The book is very well written, concise and not not becoming destructed by theoretical excursions. The fact that philosophy ala BHL is not ex cathedra discurse but field research gives freshness and sharp observations to the reader. Avoiding to polarize between ""uncivilized americans"" and civilized europeans credits BHL with objectivity and wide spectrum of participation from every day life up to intellectuals, politicians and even Hollywood opinions. Good contribution to bridge the gaps of recent years between USA and Europe away from chronical antiamericanism syndrom"
"Negative","same old driver issue: Like many others have already posted, the driver is not available online. I purchased it and wanted to install driver on the airport as Albuquerque airport has free internet. Well, driver was not available on the net. I do have the cd but my laptop does not have a cd-drive (its one of those compact 12 inch laptops with no cd-drive). So, I am out of town not having access to my extrenal cd-rom drive and as the software is not installed I cannot use the device's wireless capabilities. I am already thinking of returning it to compusa once I get back home."
"Negative","Wind Speed and Rain Gauge are Inaccurate: I have owned the product for about 6 months. While the remote transmissions work very well, the wind speed and rain gauge are very inaccurate. They are often off by a factor of 3. This product is a nice try, but it doesn't work."
"Negative","PRODUCT NEVER SHOWED UP: My items ordered did not show up. I had to request refund. I would have rather had the CD I ordered not the money."
"Negative","don't buy this version, you'll feel jipped!: I bought this version thinking that it was going to be an improvement on the original DVD version...I was wrong. I have what I would consider a pretty sooped-up home theater and I could tell no difference in picture quality between this and the regular version DVD. Furthermore, the only audio track you get is the Mandarin version. If you want to understand what is going on and you don't understand Mandarin, you're forced to turn on the subtitles...I HATE SUBTITLES!!!While I see what ""Superbit"" is trying to accomplish, I don't think there are many folks who will be able to tell a difference. Buy the regular DVD. You'll thank me later."
"Negative","Fine, but high defect rate.: The Saitek Eclipse II is a fine keyboard... it has the traditional layout for the cursor keys, which is critical to me, and controllable backlighting with a bit of sidelighting. That's all good. The feel is a smidge mushy but works well for fast typing.But... they aren't manufactured reliably. The biggest problem is half the spacebar not working. To fix this, you have to disassemble the keyboard, readjust the rubber membrane under, reassemble and readjust the spacebar springs. Do an internet search on the words ""fix saitek eclipse"" to get a sense of how common this is. Fixing it takes about 10 minutes, not a killer but kind-of annoying. I've had this problem with all three Saitek Eclipse IIs I've had.My only other gripe is that there's no power key (for putting the computer to sleep) on the keyboard."
"Negative","biased and unfair: this book is asymmetrical warfare: a ludicrous spinfest that rewrites history by simply omitting all inconvenient facts.for shame."
"Negative","terrible re-design of a great classic: Handle is cheap plastic; handle doesn't attach firmly to pot, so you have to tighten frequently; pressure seal is unreliable. Generally not good quality"
"Positive","Pulls You In: I was given this book and have found it comfortably engaging, gently surprising and satisfying complete--like a bowl of gourmet soup. A stunning display of the writers craft, an eye that dotes on nature's details and a mind that deftly connects reader to subject. A joy."
"Negative","Much smaller than the box pictures: I bought this at the Toys R Us store. The box pictures large children playing in the pool area. The size of the pool is very deceiving. It is a small rectangular pool and the slide takes up half of the space in the pool. I have two preschoolers (ages 2 and 4) and this pool is just the right size for them. This pool is MUCH smaller than it looks on the box."
"Positive","Hellhounds: Dog gone good movie times 3. I highly recommend for anyone who is looking for a title that will really grab them."
"Positive","Works perfect for me!: Hey, what can I say, it's a cart. However I was looking for a small cart that would handle a Hobart 140, tank and fit under a cabinet. Does exactly all of the above for me and wheels around the garage, so 5 stars it gets!"
"Positive","A doll is a doll: What is the matter with you muppets, a doll is a doll. Whether myscene or bratz, they are still lumps of plastic! They are both cool, but Barbie is the original! So what if myscene copied bratz! they both have dodgy heads and big feet I like them both!Dolls are things which should be enjoyed, not used as a subject of war, If you only like myscene, then like myscene. Same with the bratz, cuz to be honest, they is quite useless anyway!"
"Positive","Surprised my husband with this one: My husband loved this group when they were popular in the 90's I guess. He listens to it all the time. Brings back such good memories."
"Negative","Sun Zapper is too small to do any zapping.: The sun zapper is too narrow to be of any help. When attached to the visor appropriately, it is too high to be of help unless you are very tall. I am average height and it doesn't block the sun at all unless its nearly noon."
"Positive","Mesmerizing Flights of Prose: One thing that Chua does exceedingly well is stylizing. Nevermind the story (if it were a bit more connected, I'd give him 5 stars). He is brassy, he is vulnerable. He is vulgar, he is tender. This is the sort of book that requires much of its readers. Those who take it at face value will hate it (as some of the reviewers above have). The narrator may not be likeable, but then again there is a reason why the author made him that way. Those who prefer to be spoonfed should turn to Stephen King or Higgins or Danielle Steel.I like this book because it has guts. It'll make you wince and gag and chew your lips to shred. Chua has the power of a very keen poet. Highly recommended to writers or those with a deep appreciation for prose."
"Positive","Good If You're Just Starting Out: This is a good mixer, but not great. The beaters can slip a bit and it each other. It hasn't died, so my only complaint is with the beaters slip, but for the price, it is a minimal annoyance."
"Negative","I've had better.: The pros about this cam is that the pictures.. were decent. And the software was pretty cool.But the cons? You could not keep enough batteries around to keep it goin.. and the flash is way too bright.. it even actually effected the pictures."
"Positive","A must have for the future beauticians of all ages: Among many other things, my daughter loves to style hair. This is the perfect ""toy"" for her. She styles Sasha's hair differently everyday. It's durable and can even be shampooed! What a great find and well worth the price!"
"Negative","Worst movie I have seen this year!: There is nothing like wasting your money on a rental. Thank the Lord I did not purchase this DVD because it was horrible. I just finished watching Stomp the Yard II. Unfortunately, I can only rate this movie with 1-star, if I could give it a lower rating, I would. The dancing was pathetic, the acting was weak.... I could not connect with any of the characters it was just blah! I loved seeing Stephen Boss - Twitch (so you think you can dance) and Columbus Short, however it was not enough to make this movie good! Without a doubt the first movie was so much better. In the first movie the acting, dancing and story-line was really good. I like to support black movies and I am not sure who the writer, director and producer was on this movie. But clearly they need to go back to the drawing board. Huge flop!"
"Negative","Adjustable arm shower head: I tried to use with diverter valve, but unbalanced torque created havoc with sealing gaskets.That's why helicopters have two rotors."
"Negative","No fit on ZR85: Purchased this battery for our ZR85 and the mounting slide does not fit tight enough to recharge it. Now we are having to pay shipping charges on its return. The Canon BP535 says it fits all ZR style cameras. What's up?????"
"Positive","I learned a lot from this album: The movie as well as the album are great lessons in life. I learned so much and I keep going back to Graffitti Bridge because I can't get enough of the songs. ""Joy In Repetition"" tells the story of my own life, ""Elephants and Flowers"" has fantastic lyrics, ""Tick Tick Bang"" is funky and typical O(+> work. I adore this album and I think that you must see the movie be4 purchasing the cd. Open mind, open heart, changing lives......"
"Negative","this book is a mess: typos everywhere. really needs an editor. way too many characters. too many plots. it's like 3 books in one. munchausen, nuclear waste, peodophilia, stalkers, relationship break ups and typo typo typo."
"Negative","It does not work as advertise. It blurs the screen: I had high hope for this unit, but it turns out to be a disappointment. The documentation says it does not blur the screen. This is not true. I can see black diagonal lines on my screen, and this is sitting directly in front of the monitor. It's bad enough to make it unbearable.As for privacy protection, it doesn't help much. It just makes your screen a little darker. I can still be seen and get caught surfing while at work. I also had my colleagues tested it with the same opinion."
"Negative","the dance lessons are boring.: i was disappointed in this dance lesson dvd. i was expecting more from this two dancers. well i made a mistake. john is just a starting student in ballroom dancing so it is pretty obvious he cannot teach well. john depended all his cues from his partner who is a seasoned dancer but the dvd fell short. they cramped several dances in this one dvd so they only teach one or two steps per ballroom dance and it is not enough even for a beginner. it is not advisable to buy a dance lesson dvd with all the dances in one dvd because the teachers in it will just teach a few steps so as to fit it in one dvd for a limited one hour of running time. i suggest you buy one dance for one dvd so the lessons would be comprehensive. don't buy 10 dances in 1 dvd for one hour running time, that is ridiculous, that is not enough to learn anything from it."
"Negative","Sooooo junk, and over priced: Developed blade play in 1 minute, adjutment does not last. P.O.S . Like the aluminum handles though. Not a good buy, get mtech instead."
"Negative","Higdon Disappoints: After learning that Jennifer Higdon was the most performed of our current crop of American composers I bought this recording of her work in great anticipation. I must admit that I was greatly disappointed by both the Concerto for Orchestra and City Scape. Higdon clearly thinks that her music must break new ground of ""challenges"" to the listener rather than providing a pleasant musical experience, which I'm sure she is capable of producing. Her music is the type that excites academics and some musicians with irs inventiveness, but fails to captivate a concert audience."
"Positive","the perfect combination: i do not have the cd in front of me so i won't get into the attributes of each and every track but i can tell you 3 things:1)buy this cd2)you'll love it3)i guarantee it (of ocurse, this is not legally binding).i think the secret of this cd's success lise in the perfect mixture of old fashioned oriental tunes and beats together with up-to-date technology and thoughts. i liked the way the tracks took me from the stuffy vibrand inside of a bedouin tent on a cold starry mid-sahara night into the throbbing and sexy lounge of that favorite night club i always want to go back to.great for background listening and great to get yourself, and your guests into the mood for more!"
"Positive","Amazing!!: I love this item.... You can keep drinks cold for a long extended period of time. I started using it for my sandwiches too in my lunch box."
"Positive","Creative art, moving prose: Between the pages of this book Elisabeth Wilson bares her soul as artist and writer. Beautiful artwork combined with deeply moving prose creates a wonderful work that strikes a resonant chord in the reader. The final part of the book includes the materials and techniques that she used to create the artworks in the book. Wonderfully touching, a highly recommended read for when you want to turn your mind from the troubles of the day to a deeper, peaceful place."
"Positive","Unbelievable Talent!: I can not believe how beautiful this CD is!!! Syleena has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard. After listening to this CD I can honestly say that she is now one of my favorites of all time. She sounds like no one else, perhaps she can be compared to the old soul singers like Millie Jackson with a newer-hipper sound. Her voice has a yearning, passionate quality that forces you to take notice. Every single song on this CD has it's own personality. I am a lover of Hip-hop and R&B but I am dissappointed by a lot of the singers today because most don't have the talent, just the right look. But, Syleena Johnson clearly has both. She is also a wonderul songwriter--the lyrics are true poetry. I have never been this moved by a CD-- EVER."
"Negative","what in the hell was pitchfork thinking?!: This album, quite simply, is crap. It's boring and, at best, mediocre. I tried and tried to get into this, not wanting to miss out on what was hailed as such a great disc. But I just don't get it."
"Positive","Excellent to Watch WITH Your Kids!: The time, 1957, was a Simpler time, when the only worries most young boys had were schoolwork and girls. One young boy though has more interesting ideas ~ he daydreams of alien invasions and doing battle with Communist agents. When a local legend about a giant iron man proves to be real, the real threat is not from the Communists or aliens but the government. A story which pits a young boy against his feelings (good and bad), his friendship with a 50 foot iron giant, and the government he thinks he should believe. This is an excellent story for kids with mild violence. In the end the iron giant gives his life to save the young boy's town."
"Positive","Let's fight!: Track 2 is excellent, The Sailor-Song. It's so funny. Also, Best Friend and Eenie, Meenie, Miney, Mo."
"Positive","Michael Myers Lives!: Not the best although much more enjoyable than HALLOWEEN 2. This installment lacked the action of part 4, but it was still good. Michaels mask in this looked a bit pathetic and the way he killed people in this is like the style of Jason from FRIDAY THE 13TH movies. I liked the bit where he takes his mask off and sheds a tear, in a moment of thought. The ending is mysterious and there is also the appearence of a man dressed head to toe in black. Overall a good film which is better than part 2 & 6."
"Negative","Buggy Software: I tried to use this software in a school setting and it simply would not work for long. I got the same error message as others have gotten. If it was reliable it would probably be an excellent educational reaource. Too bad."
"Positive","Very satisfied with purchase!: I was very pleased when I received my order, it was in pristine condition and the scent was just perfect! This fragrance was discontinued years ago, so I was certain the fragrance would have spoiled during the time it had been sitting in some warehouse. On a day I wore the fragrance my niece commented that smelled Gucci Rush. Imagine her surprise when I told her I was wearing it! We were very disappointed when the scent was discontinued, it's good to know that it's still available somewhere."
"Positive","Great product for price: Product works great for the price. We use it for backup vocals at our church and the sound quality through our system is fine. It didn't come with the clip-on mics as advertised but I called the customer service number and they sent them out right away. Customer service was very good. All in all a fine product for this price range and you will not be disappointed"
"Negative","Cliched characters and a dragged out plot: Like many other reviewers, I loved ""Daisy"" and expected better from this book. It's hard to warm up to a main character who refuses to enjoy the many advantages in her life (beauty, talent, success, wealth, popularity).""Baby Girl"" is the type of person we'd all want to shake in real life. In this book however, people can't stop falling all over themselves to do things for her (unappreciated I might add). I didn't find it especially funny, but the nostalgic sections did appeal and were very well done. Maybe it's a reflection of the author's southern heritage, but did she really have to supply ""Baby Girl"" with a thinly disguised ""mammy""? Would it have hurt the book if her psychiatrist had been tall, thin, Black and beautiful instead of an overweight Black woman who goes way beyond a professional attachment to her patient?"
"Negative","verbal diarrhoea: the content was fascinating and definately worth reading in hard copy form, but the audio c/d was a nightmare. The narrator must have been hiring the recording studio by the minute because he read at a breakneck pace. At first it was acceptable , but soon became difficult to follow then tedious and annoying. The speed of the reading allowed for no digestion or comprehension of points , and soon was down right frustrating. As a consequence the second and third c/d's were almost a waste of time, I doubt if i could force myself to listen to it again, unless there was a way of play back at half speed."
"Positive","My favorite of the trilogy: After the 97 re-releases, Empire became my fave. of the 3. Loved it! What more can you say."
"Positive","A must see!!: Me and my kids loved this one. It was better than the first one to us. I like the way they brought the boot cat into the scene. We laugh and laugh at that cat. We love everything about the film. If you have a child take the kid to see it."
"Negative","This movie is a mess, but the ladies make it a bit easier to get through it: When will casting directors learn that Hayden Christensen can't act? I've never seen him turn in a decent performance. The Virgin Territory plays for laughs most of the time, the only problem is, it's not really funny. Tim Roth seemed to be having a good time as the villian, but even he couldn't twist the lazy writing and make it appealing.The only saving grace are some beautiful women that don't seem to be too shy when it comes to showing skin. There isn't even enough of that to make this film worth watching. I've seen plenty of worse flicks, but I can't imagine anyone really liking this one."
"Negative","Fine until it breaks :(: I purchased this product based on the Cooks Illustrated review and on ratings here, but we have only had it ~6 months and the rivet that keeps the thing together broke apart last week (clearly it should be something stronger than a rivet)! We only use our garlic press once or twice a week, so it really didn't get much use before it broke! We had our old Zyliss way over a decade before it gave up the ghost! I think we only paid ~ $12 for that Zyliss. This was nearly $40! I'm pretty appalled that something so expensive for what it is could be of such shoddy workmanship :( !Someone else referred to the design of this as ""over-engineered"", but I would say that some engineer really blow it when they chose how the thing would be held together - clearly not enough engineering went into that!!!"
"Negative","Just what you would expect from Michael Moore: Michael Moore tells a good story, if you don't mind a liberal fairy tale. Anything Moore puts out needs to be taken with the understanding that he aims his stories for the uninformed masses. The thing that scares him the most is someone who thinks for themselves."
"Positive","A new holy decree, check it out!: Hey there, Patriarch with another holy decree. Yours truly has seen a lot of hot women wearing these big hoop earrings and that has truly shown him the light. Hoop earrings are the world's sexiest earrings. Now the one inchers are ok, but if you really want to impress you gotta go with the 2"". So as you may have inferred, my latest decree is that all women must now wear big hoop earrings all the time. There I said it. Oh yeah, you can take them off when necessary of course. I just mean as part of your standard dress. Anyway, if you are a women reading this, which you probably are, I will let you get going because you have to buy hoop earrings now. OR, if you already own them you have to go put them on. Ok Patriarch signing off."
"Positive","Nice headphone for the right price.: These headphones are very comfortable, have great sound, and are pretty good with the noise cancelling feature. I especially like the wrap around feature."
"Negative","Warning - read product details and go for the upgraded model!: I ordered this as a gift for my daughter, thinking it was like the one I have had for 10 years. I didn't realize that the bowl does not have a handle, plus the low wattage leaves a lot to be desired for mixing basic things like thick cookie dough. With the handled bowl being so expensive as a separate order item, - and you WILL want the handle -it's worth it to just get the 450 watt model with the handled bowl and pouring shield."
"Negative","order cancelled: this is the second time i have placed an order for this item from shoplet, gotten a cofirmation and then later an email saying the order was cancelled but that i could go back on amazon to reorder. both times the price was much higher when i linked back to amazon than the original posted price when i ordered and which had been confirmed."
"Positive","The Atonement Chapter: This volume concludes the Atonement chapter as well as the first season, and in my honest opinion the best one of the six. In this chapter the English voice actors/actresses really shined, especially Rena, whose English voice used to be like sharp nails grinding across a chalkboard. You can really feel the emotions in this last chapter that tells that the friend will trust each other and help each other when they're in a dire situation. I wish I could give this item a six-star rating instead. Ni~pah!"
"Positive","My favorite KV video!: This is my fourth and favorite KV video! Both the AM and PM workouts are wonderful! The AM workout is ultra energizing and leaves you feeling refreshed and ready for the day. The reps are tough but Karen really inspires you to keep going and to feel the burn! The PM video is really my favorite. I sit all day at the office and this video has some truly wonderful stretches that leave my aching body feeling relaxed as well as strong! I recommed this video for anyone - probably intermediate level and above - who needs something quick and effective in the morning and something effective yet relaxing in the evening. I also liked the PM yoga moves a lot more than the straight up yoga videos (I don't have enough balance for those). The PM yoga stretches are a nice intro to yoga, so you might also consider this video, if you are thinking about trying yoga."
"Negative","Great pictures but terrible text.: This book torments my husband and I. We can't help but look at it every week because of the pictures of the developing fetus, but we inevitably start reading the text, which we find irritating due to its condescending oversimplistic tone. The content itself is not great either; each week there is an ailment or problem discussed which is either frightening or not applicable, such as cancer during pregnancy, which I believe is filed under week 30. Is that the week I'm likely to get cancer?I know you can find pictures of growing fetuses online. I would do that, and avoid buying this book."
"Positive","Excellent quality: Excellent quality both in workmanship and sound quality.Recommend to anyone having hearing issues weather it be organic or from being in a noisy environment.Pro. Ease of implementation."
"Positive","best measuring cups ever: I asked for these for Christmas as soon as I read about them. I love having the different sizes. If you obsess (like I do) about getting the measure exactly right, these are unbeatable. They are obviously best for liquids but work for dry ingredients as well. They're dishwasher safe, but easy to clean by hand. My only gripe is that the ridge on the inside makes them a little trickier to scrape when you have a thick liquid like oil or buttermilk and you want to get all of it down to the last drop. But, since this feature is what makes the cups what they are, it's hard to consider that a fault."
"Positive","HD595 headphones: Great pair of headphones, excellent sound quality. If planning on using for mobile listening the connector is large and often gets in the way."
"Negative","Dissapointing: While the mountain is a nice centerpiece to a train layout. It is a little impractical since it is hard to layout track going through the middle level that doesnt interfere with track going in the bottom level. Also the middle level uses these little plastic tabs to support the track which have very quickly gotten bent/stretched so that the middle level supports dont work well anymore. This makes track connected to the middle level a little too low and results in trains getting stuck while going through the lower level. I am dissapointed in the quality of this item from learning curve. It needed to be a little taller so that trains could get through the bottom level without getting stuck and they should have had better support tabs for the middle level and you should be able to connect the two large sides together without the middle section. I would recommend looking around for the hill and mountain expansion set instead of this if you want mountains in your layout."
"Negative","Lasted less than a week...: Not worth it. After only using it less than a week, it burned up. All it was used for was grinding up boiled potatoes and carrots for the baby and then it just quit with a strong burning smell. Would not buy another one."
"Negative","What the heck did they do to Spyro?: ...those people who said it glitches up and is jerky are right. We only played one hour and it froze. And, please, how do you get to the other levels? It makes no sense compared to the other Spyros. If you like Spyro, I suggest you get Spyro 3. (Return of the Dragon?) This clunker belongs in the discount rack. Don't pay top dollar for it. You will be kicking yourself if you do."
"Negative","Html for dummies: This book leaves out the basics of how to use the code. It uses code with no explanation. The explanations add no value. The index is incomplete in most cases. It was very poorly done. I am not a dummy. I was looking for a book that explained how to write html pages and use the language. This book dwells too much on how to write a pretty web page. It leaves out how to use the html code. It has no value for me. Don't buy this book.. You will be sorry and won't learn anything from it."
"Negative","Awful...Makes Cliffhanger look like a Best Picture candidate: This movie was terrible, and the special effects are about as advanced as 1980 or 1981. The acting, well it was worse than the story or the special effects. This was clearly the real Bill Paxton, and Chris O'Donnell has been lousy in anything I've seen him in. In fact, these guys make Lithgow and Stallone look like Best Supporting Actor and Best Lead Actor candidates for their work in Cliffhanger (and Cliffhanger as Best Picture). On top of all else I didn't like about this movie, it was absurd to think about the rescue team running around at 25,000 feet without even breathing heavy (yet the guys taking it easy waiting for them were wasting away of edema). If you want a mountain movie, go with K-2, or just rent Everest (Imax). At least they're based on real-life (the Imax version IS real-life), and provide a certain amount of inspiration to the viewing experience. Gosh, this one, was BAD!"
"Negative","darkest setting hardly browns: The toaster needs a minumun of 2 toasting cycles. Am I the only one having this problem? When I put it at the darkest setting, the bread/bagel is still white! I'll put up with it because of the price."
"Negative","confusing beginner's book: The book has very few species, a terrible index, discusses plants it has no photos of, and seems to jump all over. If one of my past college students had given me this book as a report, i'd have given them a C-. Poor organization, repeats itself, constant references to peat filtration, but no advice on the proper way to do it... really a disappointing conglomeration that leaves the user wondering what in the world is the best way to set up a planted aquarium. Don't buy."
"Positive","Post war Europe revisited: Tony Judt's well researched and well written book is an incisive and enlightened read. Detailed and sometimes trenchant analysis of the aftermath of WW II in Europe describes the forces which shaped the politcal and national boundaries of the subsequent Cold War and which continue to haunt the emerging democratic states in the 21st Century."
"Negative","Dunno...: The recipes in this book are harder, more time consuming, etc... than standard bread making and more so than those in his ""everyday"" book. It has a really, very good buttermilk pancake recipe, but the rest that I've tried turned out difficult and didn't come out very nice. Maybe my fault, and I'm not giving up, but it's certainly not one for the faint of heart."
"Negative","Dissapointed: Compared to the other prima guides especially comparing the World of Warcraft guides, I was expecting more from this guide. More class details and information about trade skills. The maps that are given in the book are almost useless since the game itself shows you most of the info already by adjusting you are looking for with the in game map.The game itself is great though. Guide isnt worth the money."
"Positive","Acne and wrinkles are better...: This stuff leaves your face feeling smooth and clean. I have been using it for about 2 months and I can definitely see and feel the difference. I have less acne, fading acne scars and less fine wrinkles. When I ran out I stopped for 2 weeks and noticed I had some outbreaks starting and my skin looked tired. I ordered it right away and viola....fresh clean skin again."
"Positive","Excellent book for a more realistic approach towards savings and retirement.: In some ways this book is like the other books out there: work hard, save money, let it compound. However, he does preach something that no other book I have read teaches. Most people say you save all your life and then you retire, and that is where they end their story. They focus on all the ways to save up enough money to retire and live off the interest. However, for most people that is impractical, and impossible for some. This book on the other hand gives you a good way to think about how to deal with your money in stages, and realize that retirement is not the end of your investing. Easy read, lots of good info, not too many stats to bog you down. Overall, very glad I read it."
"Negative","its ok. a little thin: i just got it, its alright, its a bit thin, so i put some padding under it. but hey, its cheap right?"
"Positive","Long time...worth the wait: Third Eye Blind released their third CD today and it is brilliant. This is the first of their three releases that newest member Tony Fredianelli plays/sings on and the quality of 3EB's sound jumps up a notch with his contributions. The songs are true 3EB...original and honest.As a reference, their debut album (1997) is still played daily in my car. It is rare that I play anything else (although their second album, BLUE is mixed in every once in awhile). I get the distinct feeling that the first album will now have some competition for the rotation on my CD player. The music on this latest release does not seem manufactured...It is quality from beginning to end.The limited edition DVD is great too...You get a bit of a behind-the-scenes look at the band as well as a song that is not on the CD."
"Negative","Shiny but hollow: Undeniably beautiful, the artistry cannot be faulted. These are visually stunning movies with exquisitely (and sometimes grotesquely) rendered images. However, as dazzling as the artwork is, the story leaves much to be desired. At all times purposely obscure, it is more than just a little difficult to follow. What begins as simply bewildering soon becomes annoying, a mindless tease for reasons unknown. What made this even worse was when the story was finally revealed it was so simplistic in nature that a mere sentence could sum it up: making this much ado about absolutely nothing. This is storytelling at its worse; barely above mindless rambling.The story: in a city where demons are forgotten by humans, a battle ensues to teach the humans a lesson and to bring an oppressor to power over all. Yeah, that's pretty much it, good against evil. No surprise who wins.Top marks for looks, zero for being incomprehensible. Won't put myself through another sitting, not a keeper."
"Negative","Black Stone Cherry: Black Stone Cherry's CD is the best album that I have ever bought! Every single song on the CD is awesome! I love it! I clicked on five stars but for some reason it is showing 2...THIS CD IS a 5 all the way!!!"
"Positive","Good Filter: Works exactly as promised! Easily screws on and tightens with the twist of your hand. I purchased this with a number of maintenance items from Briggs & Stratton brand and all worked well and performed as advertised."
"Positive","Great book: I received this book as a gift, and subsequently purchased for a friend. The advice is practical, and the book isn't preachy. My 15mo old routinely uses 10 basic signs (milk, eat, pain, sleep, etc.), and I think our lives are much better for it. Instead of crying or shouting, she can ask for what she wants. I can't compare to other books, because I haven't read any, but sign language has been a very positive thing for our family, and we were successful using the advice in this book."
"Positive","The Seer and the Sword: More like a movie than a book!: With quick ""scene changes"" within the chapters, The Seer and the Sword reads like a film script rather than a novel. This trait adds much imagination to this book.I, with a forgetful mind, do not usually like novels with a lot of characters to remember the names of. Yet, in The Seer, it added a bit more enjoyment.You could call it a fantasy, but that would be an understatement. With different kingdoms, magic, and huge wars being fought all over the land combines the elements of a fantasy so sweetly it needs a cherry on top.Anybody who neglects to read this book is missing the chance of a lifetime, a bright color in the mind's eye of books."
"Negative","Do Not Buy From This Seller: I bought a macbook from this seller for Christmas and we received the product in time for christmas. At first she liked the computer but after a few month she noticed the computer having problem with freezing when running different programs. We took it into a shop and found out that one of the RAM ports was not functioning and the tech told us that it appeared to not have been working for a while. When I contacted the company they told me that their stuff is only covered for 60 days but they'd love for us to send them the computer so we could pay them even more to fix the problem it came with! What a rip off. The computer isn't a year old and it's already dead and the company's response is pay us more to fix it! Save you money and buy one new or at least from someone else because these guys are complete crooks."
"Negative","Threw it away: By the time he started talking about how much this guy's prostrate burned when he urinated and about a black girl getting raped, I decided to throw this one away..."
"Negative","Bias book about serbian history - from pro albanian independence lobbyist: Apparently Mr. Malcome did a good job as lobbyist and a rather poor job as historian; i would recommend everyone who read that book or who intends to read it to visit www.kosovo.com; several Serbian academics analysed his remarks about the history of Kosovo presented in his book; their analysis is scientific, precise and revealing; in any case, it shows that Mr. Malcome should stick rather to popular literature than to History; check simply (...)"
"Negative","It literally stinks: This hose is, unfortunately, very smelly. It works OK, though sometimes the lock while pulling out the hose doesn't engage, which can be frustrating. But the smell is very rough. I left it unwound in my shop for 3 months, hoping the smell would dissipate, but it has not. The hose still reeks.I will probably throw it away and buy something else."
"Positive","Not a rehearsal but the real thing!: Saw this made for TV movies for the first time in 1982 and have been waiting ever since for a DVD. Great plot and stars and not really dated. Recommend highly.JBF"
"Positive","Wisdom of Teams a valuable reference for all organizations: A must read for organizations, both business and government wishing to utilize the strength of teams to further performance and accountability."
"Negative","OMG his voice changed!: I was desperate to add some Fats Waller to my collection of backing tracks, so I didn't do as much research as usual...WHY IS A FEMALE VOICE USED FOR THE SAMPLE TRACKS? One never knows, do one?"
"Negative","HORRIBLE UNSAFE INGREDIENTS: Buyer beware...It contains petroleum, mineral oil, a very cheap filler, SLS which is toxic to the body, and more bad chemicals including Methylparaben. I hope the professionals buying these products will take time to educate themselves and become more AWARE of these toxic and unsafe ingredients. If you don't believe me go look them up. I am a massage therapist and the last thing I would use is this product!"
"Positive","Great way to show off the 3D television.: While I agree that this would serve very well as the intro video prior to an Airbus or Boeing factory tour, the 3D flight scenes are fantastic. There is clearly a blend, seamless, between true IMAX video and CGI. I have issues with parralax and the only time there was a problem was during the intro credits and a few scenes shot of a boardroom with the manufacturing facility reflecting on the glass between the meeting and the camera. I tend to close one eye during these shots since a focus for me is out of the question. The shot of the glider soaring through the mountains sold me, and it's only one of many shots that make the production an experience over just being a 3D gimmick."
"Positive","The perfect extension cord, IMHO: Forget the name Coleman -- a standard of quality and reliability for decades. Forget the fact that this made of super-rugged, high-capacity 14-gauge wire. Forget that this is a grounded 15-foot extension cord. Wait a second -- I think we've forgotten too much.What I mean to say is, when you put all these factors together -- the safety, toughness, dependability, and convenience of this extension cord, you might think it would cost $50. Wrong. $35? Wrong! It's a steal at only (insert actual price here).Seriously, folk -- you can never have enough high-quality extension cords, so do stock up!"
"Negative","Terrible movie, very dark!: I purchased this movie for my three children over the weekend. Even my 11 year old thought this movie was sad and scary, let alone my 2 other younger children. Avoid at all costs! Wish I could return it!"
"Negative","flippant, nihilistic, turgid, self-important: All of Pynchon's books are hard to read because of his twisted syntax, and this is no different.The story is about uninteresting, uninvolving people.The story seems to exhibit a fair amount of misogyny, since there is a climatic scene where the herione is shown to have undergone a number of horrible body modifications due to her greed and promiscuity. Futhermore, she is shown to be attacked, robbed, and fatally wounded by a group of street urchins while the hero looks on without acting to come to her aid. I found this to be very sickening.The rest of the book is very smug and arrogant too, in my opinion. I've put a lot of effort into trying to read Pynchon over the years, and I feel it has been entirely wasted. I am very bitter about this, I freely admit."
"Negative","Unhelpful Card Order: I found that this product was way more hassle than it was worth. I am studying Hebrew using BBH and thought these cards would be keyed to that grammer since the author's names are on it. However, best I can tell the cards are placed in word frequency order NOT the order of the vocabulary by chapters. Thus, I have hundreds of cards I have to rifle through and sort by chapter myself. Then in the end there are not cards for every vocabulary word in the grammer itself.Do yourself a favor- save time and money by writing out your own flashcards on notecards or paper. This is NOT WORTH IT!"
"Negative","Please, spare me the reptile.: I am disturbed greatly by this film. Glenn Close is entirely unbelievable as a prisoner of war... more, a bourgeois / socialite / horror. The only thing that made me smile throughout the film was the lesbian subtext of Cate Blanchett and Frances (uber-german stoic) McDormand's relationship."
"Positive","Good product, easy to use: Good product. Good size. Easy to use. Only complaint so far is batteries only last about 24hrs.-bd"
"Negative","Not as useful as I expected: Time and place matter in Medieval Latin. I thought this dictionary would help with words introduced to Classical Latin by the rise of Christianity and with the altered sense of other words but I rarely found what I needed. Googling worked better than this volume."
"Negative","High-minded gobbledegook: After reading the reviews here, I could not wait to see Rushmore. I tried to place the hype out of my mind while watching. I was thoroughly disappointed. Yes, Jason and Bill acted their parts well. But that isn't saying much considering their roles were those of completely unlikable people. The plot was lame lame lame and without merit. What troubles me even more is the number of people who would rate this film as a ""Classic"". Hogwash. The extras are interesting, but it is difficult to be interested in extras when the film is completely uninteresting to begin with. Rushmore was a dud. Watch it once. But be most entertained by reading the reviews here."
"Positive","These Shoes are made for walking.: In the Merrill way these are great shoes. As my daughter says, ""Merrills are a hug for the feet."" Even though there are minimal straps they are in the right places and adjustable. These go everywhere! I love them."
"Negative","Bad Product!!!: I couldn't use it for a single day. It totally didn't work from the first day.Never suggest anyone to buy it."
"Positive","Amazing TV!: This is my first foray into the world of HD, and am I impressed! I have spent the last 1-2 years drooling over the technologies of Plasma vs. LCD, and right up until the end, I was leaning LCD. In the end I chose plasma due to my watching predominantly sports.Most reviews I read raved about the quality of the Panasonics, so I went with them, and I can say without a doubt, it was the right choice. The HD picture is flawless, and I like that there is a custom setting that I can use. Sound quality is also very good for TV speakers. And I definitely recommend using HDMI; if you can't tell the difference in quality from component, you'll at least appreciate having fewer cables to deal with. My only complaint is the usual: screen glare (this is the model without the anti-glare coating); but I knew that going in, so...not a big deal.Overall, I highly recommend this TV. It was a bargain at $999 with quality matching sets costing twice that."
"Negative","But, really:: OK, so it makes a pint of mixed review ice cream and it's allegedly fun to use, but really, $35 ?????. I don't think so."
"Negative","What a disappointment: As a big fan of Faye Kellerman I was really looking forward tothis book being published. I bought it the day it came out. I washugely disappointed in it. It wasn't interesting, it wasn't well plotted and I was saddened by her choice to denigrate the Mormon faith. I have really loved reading her Rina Lazarus books and learning about the Jewish faith. I have respected the character of Rina Lazarus and her devotion. So I was quite surprised that Faye Kellerman could show such a lack of respect to another faith. It was also factually incorrect, in one scene she describes a Mormon girl at her first communion wearing a cross necklace. Mormons do not celebrate first communion, and they never use the symbol of the cross. Did she not do her research? How difficult would it have been to find out? It makes me wonder about the rest of her facts. How sad."
"Positive","One of the coolest techno songs ever: If you are looking for a cool techno/trance song then this is definitely one of them. I didn't care too much for the last two mixes but the rest (especially the second track) are great. The first time I heard this song was in the movie Formula 51 during the club sequence. I spent forever trying to find this song but finally found it here on Amazon. Get this cd if not only to get a good song but to burn music from this disk to make your own trance collection (which I did). Buy this, you won't regret it.Also, I recommend to anyone else who likes this music get The Thrillseekers cd Synathaesia. It has the mix used in Formula 51 as well."
"Positive","Fresh take on a rotten subject.: Max Brooks has to be considered the ultimate modern-day writer when it comes to zombies. Between 'World War Z' and his 'Zombie Survival Guide' a zombie fan like myself is in flesh-eating heaven. 'Z' is a true masterpiece of the form though, and should be required reading for any horror/zombie fan. The research into geography, history, weapons and language are first-rate in this novel. Mr. Brooks has come up with so many new and terrifying scenarios that would undoubtedly play out in a zombie infestation that he leaves the reader feeling as if this were a work of non-fiction. A perfect piece of literature (zombie or otherwise)."
"Negative","Not worth your money: Of the many books I bought on soap making this was the worst. It had no real information in it. It skimmed on all the topics but never really explained how or why. The books written in the early 1900 on soap were more helpful than this one."
"Negative","Worst book I ever read: I have lived in Savannah for a number of years, and as I read Mr. Porter's book, I could not help but ask if he'd ever been there, or to Georgia for that matter, at all. His geography is atrocious. Does he really think you go south from Darien to get to Savannah? All it takes is to look at a map! He also plagiarizes---basing his characters on other authors' creations, grabbing descriptions of famous entertainment personalities and libertines, etc. straight from the pages of biographies of them. This book is an insult to the city and people of Savannah, to the wonderful book written by Mr. John Berendt, and to anyone who makes the mistake of buying it, or even merely borrowing it from a library! It's a piece of trash!"
"Negative","Falls apart and tips over too easily: This is a terrible toy for a child who is learning to pullup and walk! It is too light in the front, so when they try to pull up using the handle, it tips over on top of them. Also, the two little mail doors are the pop-in-the-hole type, so when my child leans on them trying to look behind them to see where the mail went or pull up on them, they fall off and she ends up falling and busting her head! Also, the three plastic ""mail"" cards are not attached and are always lost. After a week of watching it fall apart and taking care of numerous boo-boo's from her falling so much, I put the toy away for good."
"Negative","great but broken: The product is a great learning tool for infants. It is also fine entertainment for little ones who cannot keep their eyes off it. The only problem is that this DVD came in broken. Since it was purchased as a gift and had to be replace in a timely fashion it became a total loss since returning would have taken too long."
"Positive","movie: good movie. if only all the homeless had a happy ending . but real life isnt so kinda. still very good movie.."
"Positive","This Story Is Good For Halloween! Yohannes: This story is outstanding because it has a lot of interesting details and Lizzie is funny when she calls her brother Booger. My favorite part was at the end of the story, but I'm not telling you what happens! The main characters in the story are Lizzie and Booger and Brian or ""Mr. Electricity"". The problem in this story is that Lizzie won't take Booger trick -or- treating with her. Lizzie really wants to go trick-or-treating with her friends, but her parents say she has to take Booger, or she can't go at all. The story is great, I think you should buy it!"
"Positive","Worth every penny!: I get so much more use out of my Zen:Vision M player now because I can just plug it in to my television and play my music or the movies that I have loaded on it. The picture generated from the AVI files is very good; indistinguishable from a dvd on a standard television. I haven't tried it on an HD tv yet, but I suspect that it would not be as good. Nevertheless, it's great if you want to bring a library of movies/tv shows with you without the hassle of keeping up with them. I highly recommend this purchase. You won't regret it!"
"Negative","Another broken adapter: I had this adapter for about a year before it broke on me. Its a shame, because it was so small and easily packable.."
"Negative","Winkler was the good part: If you must watch this film, watch it for Winkler, who gives an interesting preview of his future role in ""Arrested Development"". Watching this movie for ""Prinz"" and ""Stiles"" is counterproductive. Not only have the actors ""failed to make the best"" of the script, the script was written from the viewpoint of the super-rich Hollywood elite who live lives with zero financial consequences. Thus, we watch as young adults walk out on culinary school, muse about becoming ""singer-songwriters"", and ""stop paying attention"" to their college plans. Much like the ""Friends"" genre that this movie shamelessly imitates, this is a ""time porn"" piece, where the characters have little else to do besides ""mature romantically"" and ""find themselves"". A movie for history's circular file."
"Positive","ITS GREAT BUT NOT MUCH GORE!: I dont see why so many people are putting this movie down. I guess it is because they were expecting more gore then was actually in the movie, and that may be because the critics and previews made it seem that way. Dont get me wrong, this movie does have its bloody parts, but its not that bad and its not nonstop violence. Now for the positives i would definatly say this is very original plot and you'll never guess who the killer actually is at the very end. The story is very good and there's lots of suspense(i dont know how you could fall asleep watching it because it at least has a good story, even if it's not that gory). It is quite entertaining and demented, and James Wan(the director)did a good job on his first movie. See it and watch it with an open mind and dont put it down because its not that gory, because i've seen pleanty of gory movies that suck and thats because it didn't have a good plot(example:Candyman)Thank you and enjoy the movie!"
"Negative","NOT the STUDENT EDITION!!!: Even after searching through Google for the student edition, as well as on Amazon, this is the first option that pops up and even says Student Edition in the product description- very misleading!!"
"Positive","Warm towels anyone?: Found that the rack does just what the info said it would do.We have had no problems- we turn it on and off when we plan to use it."
"Negative","Only for the Looks: I bought this product to play on Rock Band 3. Now, I'm not a real drummer, so I don't use this for my full potential. However, after about 30 minutes of playing on Expert, one of the legs bent and I fell over. I attempted to force the bent leg into place, and continued playing. After about 15 minutes of playing, it bent again. This is not a quality product."
"Positive","Lots of Web-specific Detail for the Advanced Programmer: >>Layout: good and easy to follow >>Content Relavence: I found the material to be very well put together and relavent to the topic of web related database design >>Examples: While not as detailed as a beginner would have liked, the examples were sufficient enough for an intermediate to advanced programmer to follow (hence the book's ""Accomplished to Expert"" User Level rating. >>Accompanying CD-ROM: Good examples with lots of source to see just how it's done.. This went a long way in assisting me in understanding other (larger) databases in Perl and Rexx. >>Price/Value: A bit pricey (but then again every technical book in Canada is). I found it close to the worth the money that I paid!"
"Negative","Very much like Edgar Rice Burroughs: If you enjoyed the John Carter of Mars series, I think you'll enjoy this colletion of books. It's a bit darker than ERB as I remember them, but very much in the same genre."
"Positive","Awesome: I LOVE this pan! I have five children and cook often. Stews and soups..it is great. It is heavy..but isn't that what a dutch oven should be? I love the color. It washes up beautifully..no staining. A great alternative to the more expensive brands. I recommend it!"
"Negative","there is nothing deluxe about this shaver: I saw this at the drugstore for only $10 and thought I would give it a try. When I opened the the bulky plastic carrying case which is included with the item, the glass mirror which is attached to it fell off. Luckily it did not break. A cheap glue had been used to secure it. It included a personal groomer for ear and nose hair with an additional attachment for shaving other body hairs. But the personal groomer is so cheaply made that it cuts off if you move it quickly, and it barely cuts. The shaver itself is advertised as a ""pleasure of a gentle shave that leaves your skin amazingly smooth and soft to touch"". But you can run this thing all over your face all day and you will still have a five o'clock shadow. After using it a couple of times (why I tried it a second time I do not know), it is very apparent that this is, as another reviewer put it, a ""hunk of junk"". Paying ten cents for this item would be too much."
"Negative","For the die hard science lover: Great to learn more about pioneers of science, but really tough reading. Great bedtime reading unless ones interest lies with some of the scientists."
"Positive","saludos: La camisa es 100% original y demaciado comoda la recomiendo a los hombres de buen gusto, llego en el tiempo estimado"
"Negative","Descriptive & poetic but boring and not kid friendly: I'm going to have to agree with the person who said they don't understand why this book got a Newberry award. I get that it's poetic. Every sentence is loaded with poetic adjectives, but as far as the story goes I'm not really following it. Half the book is in italics, and it's Dullsville. I don't think kids would enjoy this book. It's more of a Kidlit book for adults."
"Positive","Great product: To answer a few questions...It's a 6"" utility knife, a 3 qt. pot, and the book is called ""The Cooking Club Cookbook."" I think these products are great, this set sells for [$$$] at other stores and would be worth every penny. I've owned it for a month now and it is the best pot and knife I've ever owned. Be aware that there are at least two different versions of this set available, the other contains an 8"" square tray instead of the knife, and an additional utensil."
"Positive","Delta Mortising Manchie 14-651: I purchased this through Amazon and it came well packed and undamaged, unlike some other reviews I read. Perhaps they changed the packing system. Assembly wasn't too bad however putting the piston on was rather awkward as you have to compress it a little to make it fit. Fence was square to the table which is a must with one of these. I cut 16 3/8"" mortises into Oak with relative ease as the large handle gives you plenty of leverage. So far I'm pleased with the tool and like it's rugged construction and large Cast iron table."
"Positive","real cranberries: I just can say i love this album for the simple reason it is the first one and never equaled in sound, elegance, quality, essence, delicate sadness and youth. It is incomparable and it deserves to be listen by good and pacient tastes in post XX century pop music.I do recomended.(...)"
"Positive","THIS IS A GREAT WORKOUT: This is a very old workout, but it still works better than the more popular ones today. I don't admire Jane, but I do like this workout."
"Positive","For beginers: If you're just getting started and you don't have a lot of money then this is a good strap to start with. It doesn't cost a lot cause it's nothing special. Just something to get you by and it will do a good job at that."
"Negative","Hideously boring: This may be an interesting historical story, but, it needs to be condensed to about 20 min. No dramatic tension, pacing that would make Russian directors happy. Basically, a very long high school history class movie that, while perhaps historically acurate, makes you long for the buzzer."
"Positive","A good read from Bob: An interesting take on life from the mind of Mr. Newhart. He has a dry comedic mind that I wish more people would had. By George he wrote a history of his own life through his eyes. A funny bookfrom a funny man in a funny world.."
"Negative","Is anyone else tired of Eminem?: I dont know what this guys deal is but every year he gets worse and worse. What is he rapping about? What is he rebelling against? Why is always angry? Whatever it is hes almost got me convinced that platinum selling rich white boys have it rough. But now Eminem has a whole new crew full of guys that dont really do anything but try to look thugged out in his videos. Hopefully Eminem can drop his own White Album and stay out of the game just like Jay-z for the rest of his life and make the hip hop world happier."
"Negative","This Album Sucks: Listen people, don't buy this album. This album is garbage. This album is less than nothing. The maximum amount of starts I would give it would be -5. But the lowest is a 1 of course. Fifty is garbage and this album should have never been released. The dumbest thing he could do is kick the Game out of G-Unit. Please people, DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!! Save your money and go buy Untold Story or The Documentary from the Game. Once again, THIS ALBUM IS GARBAGE, YOU SUCK FIFTY!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Negative","Semi-watchable, but no triumph: I have to agree fully with Alexiel's fine review of this film; there's no point in repeating what's been said so eloquently already. It's worth finding and reading. I will add, however, that after seeing this as well as her earlier stuff,it's beyond painfully obvious that Breillat has an agenda and it doesn't include liking men. Her female character's sweeping statements about all men in general are insulting and unintelligent, and having a gay man speak for all men about how they view women is naturally, a bit skewed from the git-go. The sex isn't erotic in the least, and the shock value is so obviously there to shock, it just ends up as cinematic sludge.This is simply not an artistic film, but a dry and fairly pointless one. The ending in particular borders on inane."
"Negative","NO...This Isn't Great At All!: The Cheetah Girls are...ok. I love the movies, and the first and second soundtracks to their movies are really good.But, with their studio debut album, TCG, the spark isn't their. The only songs on the album that are good, are ""All In Me,"" and ""Homesick.""I'm glad Raven left the group, because he 2008 self-titled album was way better than this album.Also, I could really care regardless whether people disagree with me."
"Negative","Monster Dogs tries so hard but accomplishes so little: Like a movie whose trailer is much more satisfying than the actual film, Monster Dogs entices with the superb cover art and interesting premise but leaves the reader disappointed. In a futile attempt at providing enlightening commentary on such aspects of the human condition as celebrity, belonging, and friendship, Monster Dogs ultimately can't get out of its own way. In her efforts to be profound the author ignores any attempt at telling an interesting story. One example is the scattering of dream sequences throughout the story which serve only to be cryptic abstract excursions that reveal nothing of value or interset about the narrator. In the beginning, Monster Dogs promising to be a fun and enjoyable read, but in the end fails miserably to deliver."
"Positive","A Wonderful, Suspenseful Mystery Worth Reading!!!: Out of all of Duncan's books this is my favorite. I was home sick one day and I could not put this book down. The thrill and suspense in the novel was phenomonal. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone!"
"Positive","A triumph of the imagination: Francois Schuiten is one of the most accomplished artists working in the field.This handsome trade paperback reunites three graphic novels that comprise the Hollow Grounds cycle.Worth mention is the excellent arguments by his brother Luc.CARAPACES - Actually a collection of six stories that displays Schuiten's versatility, experimenting with a series of techniques.ZARA - Zara is a vertical planet inhabited entirely by woman that never experimented ""conventional"" sex with men.After the arrivalof invaders with ""vines"" below their waists, things take a bizarre and often amusing turn.Zara is a marvelous blend of satire, adventure and science fiction that should appeal for fans of trippy european comics.NOGEGON - Another baroque, amazing and wild adventure.This time a character from Zara goes in search of a missing friend andbecomes embroiled in a plot involving symmetry and murder."
"Positive","I would give it 10 STARS if I could...: My only critism of this CD, is that it did not include the original version of 'Go away'. Then again, maybe that one should have been include on the 12"" CD release. The recording quality is second to none. They used the original cover of the first released vynil, so none of the bonus tracks are on the back cover track listings. This is made up by the pull out bilingual sleeve and includes lyrics too! These songs are just as fresh today as they were in 1985. A testiment to the timelessness of the quality of Rose McDowall and Jill Bryson's superb musical skill and insights. Most would catagorize this ""PopGothic"", but it is more than just an inane label. It's ART and it sould be comtemplated and pondered upon as such. My favorite tracks? All of them and the album should be listened to as one set piece and judged as such."
"Positive","Put a Quarter in the Juke and Boogy 'till You Puke: I read the first section of ""Hannibal."" All I can say is, WOW! I came away envious of Harris' writing ability. . .It's not diminished one bit since ""Silence.""I saw the movie version of ""Silence,"" then read the book. The book was better, which is saying a lot since the movie blew my mind.I hope Hopkins and Foster reunite to do this movie. Sir Anthony Hopkins has said that he's retiring from acting, though. We'll see."
"Negative","Supplement facts have changed: I first bought this Krill oil based on 1.5 mg of Astaxanthin contained in the softgel. I bought this about 7 months ago and was pleased. I re-ordered, what I thought was the same product only to find out that this very important ingredient was reduced to .480 mg. I wish that I had known about this change prior to my purchase. I contacted the distributor and all they could do was apologize."
"Negative","we must feel bad that this was our Poet Laureate: Pinsky is in love with being a poet, but his poems don't mean anything to the rest of us. This book is a perfect example of this. We are supposed to admire him, not read him, and I find it a shame that this lousy work got him a Luareateship."
"Positive","This book put Holistic Women's Health Care on the map!: As a holistic OB/GYN medical doctor, I have found Dr. Northrup's excellent and unique book very useful professionally, and often recommend it to my patients. It can help women heal deeply, not just mask symptoms. Her newsletter, Health Wisdom for Women, is also very practical and useful, although unfortunately it has been corrupted at times by monetary and commercial interest. The new edition of the classic Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom, as well as her many tapes, are highly recommended to any woman interested in taking charge of her own health."
"Negative","worse of all: This shaver is the worse one yet for me to try on my legs.. Leaves me cuts and rashes even when i try and shave slow and steady.. But thats what u get when its you buy something cheap"
"Negative","Where are the brownies?: I must admit that this is the only time I can say I am disappointed with Amazon. I ordered this item for Christmas, it is now the 24th and has not yet arrived despite being told it was shipped awhile ago. It looks like a great product, my 18 year old son wanted it. Something fun for when friends are over. Hope it arrives some day so we can see"
"Negative","Dated and linear: Dated and linear but with a good McGuffin. I had to finish it but after it went straight in the bin. I couldn't think of anyone else who might want to read it"
"Positive","Powerful helpf for children and adults: This little book explains a very important issue for children and adults-you are allowed to have feelings. It shows a charmingly drawn little guy who progressively covered up more and more of his feelings when they became inconvenient for his parents and others. But, one day he made a friend who told him ""I'm not really like you...My tough and anger are only patches to hide my fear and lonely."" Very powerful."
"Positive","Perfect for Middle School Math & ""Read Across America"": As a teacher, I've used this book for several years as a ""read-aloud"" in my sixth grade math classroom. I time it with my geometry units. It's a hit every time. The kids truly love it, and ask great follow-up questions. The book explains the math involved in finding the circumference of the earth 2000 years ago. The language and great illustrations make the math easy to understand. Since the students also read mythology in reading class, it's a perfect cross-curricululm connection. In the past two years, I've timed it to coincide with the ""Read Across America"" movement on March 2."
"Positive","They do the job: I was trying out different breastpads, this among them. It came with a trial pair of the nighttime pads, they're thicker and worked great. The daytime version works very well, they're soft and cushy with a nice contour. They'd be perfect if there was a second sticky pad. As they are, they travel all over my bra or nursing tank and get flipped down when I go to nurse. It's a trial to get it back in place when I'm trying to 'zip up' after nursing, with a curious 4 month old looking and squirming around I'm fumbling with a bunched up nursing pad. In a pinch I'd definitely pick up a package but my primary will be lansinoh's disposables."
"Negative","Not exactly one of her best: I was disappointed with the maturity level of Henrietta. Granted she was 16, but she was a spoiled little girl from the beginning to the end. The moral of the story shouldn't be ""it's alright to do things for people as long as you believe it's right."" Henrietta demonstrated a distinct selffishness that disappointed me in the end."
"Positive","pleased: Was delighted with construction of Spindle Rocking Chair. Solid and a beautiful finish. The seat is alittle slim and the back a bit straight, but my 2 and 3 year old grandchildren do not seem to mind. Was a great choice and dad had no problems puting it together. All the pieces and tools were included."
"Positive","Mystery Walk rocks!: This is a marvelous book. I was hooked within the first few pages of the book. I couldn't put it down until I reached the end. It's a wild roller-coaster ride of emotions. I found it to be one of those books that when I finished reading it, I still wanted to read more about the characters and continue the adventure of the Mystery Walk. Robert McCammon's writing and storytelling are amazing. You can read his work and never have to realize that you are reading. You can just totally lose yourself in the fiction. I also very much enjoyed Robert McCammon's Swan Song and Boy's Life and I will surely be reading more of his work."
"Positive","no sap love story: a shocker.: some books/flics deserve our stars because they offer glimpses--a brief moment of participation-- in an ""other"" way of living in this world. i read the scribblings of Charles Bukowski for this very reason.Butterfly Kiss is a serious movie about love. at times frightening, it is a tally of sordid plot, extremely believable characters, and offers a serious chance to view a relationship and things most folks would never care to experience in person. both powerful and disturbing, but very well done. At the close of the movie i remember wanting to see Butterfly Kiss again, tho at the same time unsure that my spirit could handle/endure a"
"Negative","No description?????: I have wasted money and time by purchasing pre-order items in the past. If you really want to see the very few interviews Michael Jackson agreed to doing (Oprah, Walters & Bashir) simply log onto You Tube. You'll save your money and it's not a waste of time."
"Positive","Sleeping Stranger: This is one of the best books I have read in years. I was hooked from the first page. It is obvious that Mary Blue did her research not only into the many pantheons of mythology but also into the subtle nuances of the dieties. She played upon them brilliantly. When one reads the acknowledgements it becomes clear that the suffering endured by the heroine Hope has been Ms. Blue's suffering as well. The adventures are authentic and fun. I've never been to Sturgis but I can really imagine what it must be like. The book begins in another realm but comes to earth and covers the country from east to west with gorgeous detail all the way. The characters are people I am sure I know! Her artistry at exposing the fractured mundane aspects of the seemingly deified and then shining a light on the divinty in all of us is touching. I hope she is planning a sequel."
"Positive","Excellent excellent book: I have enjoyed this book enormously throughout. While there are a fairly large number of radar books available, this is the first that I have read that lays out the signal processing aspects of radar in such a coherent, pedagogically sound, and self-contained way, generally from first principles. For example, the exposition of slow and fast time processing throughout the book was very illuminating, as was the connection drawn between the Neyman-Pearson receiver and the matched filter. The only other text I have seen that combines such clarity of vision, readability, and rigor is the book by Peebles, which unfortunately has little material on digital radar signal processing."
"Positive","Love this video!: Really fun and energizing! I love doing this. Love the exercises, especially the floor work. I've been doing this ~2x a week from weeks 13 to 25 and think it has really contributed to me feeling great!"
"Positive","Addictive Rock - Incredible Band: I was picking up U2's new one in Virgin and I found the Upwelling album next to ""Veritgo"". I gave them a whirl on the sound station and the sound just grabbed me. It didn't cost much and about the 7th time through this EP - I was addicted. It's melodic, explosive rock, makes me think of an alternative Peter Gabriel hanging out with Pink Floyd with a twist of U2 edge. The vocals are a little in background and it took me a few more listens to catch all the words but everything just blends together so smoothly!This is an exciting band, I actually caught them live and they rocked the house. It will be interesting to see what their next release will be like as they had a number crowd pumping songs. It's great to catch a young band with so much talent right before they explode into the mainstream."
"Negative","Not Knots for beginners: This book has some examples of macrame jewelry with beads and small cord. The illustrations are poorly drawn. The directions are not clear. The book would be better for more experienced macrame enthusiasts or people who know the knots. It would work well for persons giving a class in macrame, but it is not for the beginner.I tried the simple plant hanger, but the instructions about the ""wrap"" were vague. The illustrations were not clear. There were no reccomended distances between knots to get any particutlar result."
"Positive","good product, 1 fault: I purchased this for my Toyota FJ Cruiser. It was super easy to change the combo, and install.The only down side i have with it, is that its not flush with my hitch. there is about a 3/4 inch gap between my hitch and the back of the drawer. BUT that might just be a Toyota thing, if the pin-holes on my hitch were back further there would be NO problem.It hasn't rained enough to see how it does to keep the water out.I'm keeping my key in a plastic bag, just for extra coverage.I like it so far."
"Positive","Very Good: A page-turner that invokes history, which I love, like Craig Furrnas' novel THE SHAPE, and such books, so if you're inclined toward thrillers with some ""throw back"" plotting, you'll love THE DA VINCI CODE."
"Positive","It is a classic epic, a complete story from beginning to end: Costner has created a real hero. As with many real life heroes, this one is created mostly by accident. The Postman begins as a humble traveling storyteller and ends up being the story. The common people are looking for someone (as we always are) to lead them out from the post war chaos. While the antagonist wants to impose a dictatorship on the people, the Postman becomes, by accident, their hope to restore the United States of America. In the end, it is the people who make the Postman a hero, and in that one critical moment, he answers the call. It is a truism that our heroes are usually not all the bad things they did but their glorious moment in the sun."
"Positive","The bond between mother & child truly captured: While this film is dated now, in black & white with quite loud & slapped-on background music, the essence of the story of a mother separated from her small child during the 2nd world war, then the journey that their search for each other takes them through, is absolutely captivating. The performances of the actors are quite stilted excpet for the small boy who is natural & believable. His is simply brilliant. Definitely a film I could watch more than once."
"Negative","Junk: This broke before I had even finished installing it. It will not last (didn't even last five minutes with me). You're much better off with a more expensive alternative."
"Positive","Its a good game: Well 1st off I expected it to have more levels. In frontline it had 19 levels. In rising sun it only has 10 levels. Though they are levels are longer, rising sun is not worth $50. I would say more like $40. I would strongly recommend renting it 1st"
"Positive","Ordered Two!: This is the best wine opener on the market! I have one already and have used it for over a year. It is easy to use, is portable, and the parts last. I spent alot of money on other openers, only to have them break or fall apart after minimal use. I ordered two more Oster Electric Wine Openers for gifts to friends that wanted to know where to get one like mine."
"Positive","Super cute: This item arrived on time and as expected.It is super plush and perfect for little girl play. Better price than department store."
"Negative","wasted portrayal: I was staying up late one night and happend to catch this movie late on the T.V.It starded off great, and looked like it was going to be really good. Then about 15 minutes(or somewere around that) the movie took a downward spiral toward being a cheap, and not as ambitious as it looked like it was going to be.First of all the acting was bad, and a movie like this one proves how important good acting is to a very much talked about subject matter like this one.2nd of all the movie is not that realistic. I realize the things that Ed Gein really did were far out, but this film just lacks an imortant realisitic aspect to it. For example. In one sceen Ed Gein shoots a female baretender, then while she is still alive, Ed drags her accross the floor and puts her into his truck, and takes her home. She kinda acts angery at Ed rather than fighting for her life.Bottom Line: If your want to no more about the subject, look elase where. If you must see it. Rent it. Don't spend to much on it."
"Positive","Tasty!: I liked this bar. It had a good balance of flavor and wasn't overly sweet. I would have preferred that there was a bit more protein in it, but it works as a ""snack"" bar."
"Positive","This book helps if you've some experience.: If you've built your own PCs at home and have a couple of years of experience using Windows, this book is enough to help you pass the A+.The Hardware part is great and very detailed.The OS part is adequate but doesn't really hit the marks on the exam. I had to rely on my pc experience to pass the OS exam.Overall, any person with a decent amount of PC knowledge will pass the A+ exams with no problem using only this book."
"Positive","Burn Notice / Season 2: Season 2 Better than Season 1, Funny,Fast good story lines looking farward to season 3 and more"
"Positive","beautiful: she was beautiful. this is a fascinating collection of her songs and unique voice. buy it."
"Negative","Five stars, not two.: I wrote a review a while back stating that this album bored me, etc. Shame shame shame. After listening to it more over time, I realized that in order for this album to be properly enjoyed, it has to be listened to in the right context. By that, I mean it's best enjoyed on a lazy, sunny afternoon or evening, when you're feeling chill and haven't a care in the world. By that merit, I love this album, but it really takes a lot of getting used to, more so than any other album I've owned. That is probably because this is easily the most unique album I've owned. Five stars for this album, Amazon wouldn't let me change my rating!"
"Negative","smears everywhere: Be careful with these, because the ink will NOT stay on! It smears very easily, and is definitely NOT waterproof! It washes off right away. I even tried coating it with water-resistant spray, and it still didn't work. Such a disappointment."
"Negative","Tripe: Lazy, childish, a complete waste of my time. While it's easy to say Althalus is not as good as Belgarian etc, Eddings has almost lost me as a fan - The next book will have to deliver the goods. Enough of the cute/naughty/pouting Gods and kiddy humour. If I hear 'yes dear' or 'yes pet' one more time I'll scream. Stay away from this book. Rubbish, how could his editors let this one through?"
"Negative","Wasting your $$$$: I thought this book would do as it title suggests......didn't happen...still tears....no pictures to ""show"" you, it's like reading a really boring book. And the ""stories"" are to help you knit sweaters.........which still didn't help. I have only been knitting for a couple of years, but thought this book would give me some helpful advise. I would reccommend (one of my most favorite books) ""Teach yourself Visually Knitting"" by Sharon Turner...lots of pictures with easy to understand intructions.."
"Negative","Major Disappointment: I've been a ""connoisseur"" of dark-chocolate-dipped apricots for years and this is the first time I've ordered them from Amazon.This brand, Old Naples, was a real disappointment.The apricots have an artificial flavor, a strong aftertaste, and a stale, jelly-like texture. It was not at all the melt-in-your mouth, sticky-sweetness that I have experienced from other brands.The chocolate layer is thin but more importantly, it's cheap chocolate. It's a waxy, flavorless, too-sweet chocolate that barely even looks like dark rather than milk chocolate.On the positive side, each one was individually sealed in cellophane so they weren't as messy as I expected, and the simple gold box was attractive.I would not order these again."
"Negative","don't buy: BEWARE~~~~My Western Digital ""My Book"" started randomly shutting itself down. Emails to the Western Digital ""technical support"" have gone unanswered, and you can't call them to ask a question unless you sign up for the $14 a year ""service plan"".I'm switching to another brand hard drive. hopefully I can transfer all the information off this defective drive before it crashes for good."
"Positive","Man this takes me back: After 7's debut disc was released at time when almost every R&B record released was A-1.Two-thirds of the trio are the brothers of producer Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds, and the other third is the cousin of Antonio ""L.A."" Reid; the two produced the majority of the album, which features three smash hits and a host of other likable tracks. The singles released were Heat Of The Moment, Can't Stop and Ready Or Not. Can't Stop & Heat Of The Moment were both up-tempo dance numbers while Ready Or Not is one of the best slow jams released in 1989. However the one song to me that makes the CD a classic is ""One Night,"" an urban adult contemporary composition that was never released; it showcases Melvin and Kevon in an impressive vocal exchange over a mid-tempo rhythm."
"Negative","Silly, Obnoxious Cartoon: This cartoon is one of my worst enemies. Honestly it is. The dialogue and animation is so bad, it is sickening. To say nothing of the obnoxiousness. Stay away from this TERRIBLE cartoon, because it is not worth your while."
"Negative","If you have Vista this product is worthless: Amazon.com and Texas Instruments fail to inform the consumer that the connectivity kit fot any of their TI calculators are not compatible with Windows Vista.Thanks for nothing."
"Negative","Hmmm...: I guess I'll be the dark horse among all of these five-star reviews. I hate to even take the time, however I wanted to try to forwarn anyone else purchasing this (as I did) based on the reviews alone -- and the radio song Babylon. Or maybe simply I just don't get it. I honestly still want to like this CD, but my sheer frustration with it always wins over as it is removed from my player after only 5-6 songs. Or maybe I'll have to give the second 1/2 an honest listen before carrying forth with my plans to exchange it. Track after track, it just all sounds the same. Simply, listening to it just brings me down - and angry at myself for once again buying an entire CD for one song."
"Positive","Excellent academic work: This work is an excellent study of the first African-American governor in the United States. Professor Jeffries does a competent job of explaining the pieces of the puzzle that needed to fall into place in order for Douglas Wilder to be elected governor of Virginia. He then goes on to discuss the policies of the Wilder administration. This discussion is very thorough and well-researched. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the field of political science."
"Positive","so educational and yet fun: the crusin world game is so fun because you get 2 c different places while your still sitting on the floor playing a video game.u get 2 c places and like monuments and the kind of terrean they have in that country or city or continent.i think it is better than the other crusisn usa because it has many different choices of cars. and you can choose the place you want to play in."
"Negative","Battery Never Charges: I have a BS in Electrical Engineering, and I can't get the things to charge, either. I am very disappointed with this product. I was unable to take even a single photograph on my Pentax PZ-70 camera using the Juice rechargeable battery, even after charging the battery for more than two days."
"Positive","Excellent Starter Digital SLR Kit: Nikon has put together this excellent kit especially for those who want to move up from the Point & Shoot digital to a reliable and easy to use SLR. The Nikon D40 is a basic model that provides quick shooting qualities using a standard short zoom auto focusing lenses. You'll automatically get great outdoor pictures and in-home short range pictures using the pop up flash. Unfortunately, you'll need a higher power attached flash to capture indoor pictures out beyond fifteen feet that the zoom lense will pull in. Learning the manual options will take a little time and effort and some knowledge of ISO ranges and lighting techniques are required. But for us amateurs the auto setting will do 9 times out of 10. The other draw back for us amateurs is that the Nikon D40 is limited to AF-S (self auto focus) lenses unless you want to manually focus each shot every time. Bottom line is this is an excellent buy for the money spent."
"Positive","Another Great Album: I bought this cd at their concert in Pomona. They are an awesome live band and this new cd reflects how great they really are musically. I don't think it's quite as good as ""Full Circle"", but then it's hard to top the best album ever. They haven't strayed from their roots like so many punk bands today. Thanks for another great album!!!"
"Negative","very depressing....: This book was my book club's selection for the month. It was one month I wished I would have skipped. Where the book is well-written, the story itself is very sad. There is a saying....""don't judge a book by its cover""...The cover is very misleading. The lives of the elderly women are far from quaint lunches and a wild joy ride. For someone with an elderly relative with declining health and who knows the toll that it has on caregivers, this was too much realism."
"Negative","you wouldn't want to use this: The cards go into a very tight compartment, and must be pushed in. My cards are standard size.The cards come out in poor condition. The edge on my cards look like a scissors tried to trim them.I found this (see link below) at Staples, although it's sold here at Amazon, I didn't see this on my original search - perhaps I filtered only for Amazon Prime eligible:This is much better for my purposes - thicker - but the cards come out fine.http://www.amazon.com/Rolodex-76657-Profile-Personal-Card/dp/B001PMG8MQ"
"Positive","very valuable information: This is my work background:1) I've spent almost 10 years as a counselor in a psychiatric setting.2) For over a year, I was as a counselor for a Domestic Violence Shelter.3) Currently, I'm in Law Enforcement.I thought that this book would have nothing to offer me; I was wrong. Becker has written an easy to read, fascinating, all too important book that could potentially save your life.I have recommended this book to court service personel, who work exclusively with victims of violent crime. I have personally proffered the information, contained within this book, to numerous victims - especially, those people who are being stalked."" The Gift of Fear"" is invaluable.It's worth your time. Quite literally, this book could save your life.I'm not exagerating."
"Positive","Great clips: Terrific for adding a special touch to letters! There's something for everyone. A little slow to print on my outdated system though."
"Positive","Not As Bad As Alot Complain It To Be: While most people agree that Fight For The Rock is NOT Savatage's most well recieved album and is only for die-hard fans, I myself am not a die-hard fan but do like their music as well as this album. Fight For The Rock DOES have some great moments with song's such as Fight For The Rock, their version of the Badfinger Classic Day After Day, as well as Free's Wishing Well, Hyde and She's Only Rock 'N Roll. I remember buying this on Cassette (way way) back in 1986 at the ripe 'ol age of 19 (now 39). Ahhh those were the day's."
"Positive","excellent car mag: The big 4 car mags are all about the same. That being said, I love them all. This one is no exception. Great pictures, great articles, and reasonable reviews."
"Positive","One of the best documentaries you will ever see !: You may see thousants of documnetaries but this the one that you will say yes. I promise you an amazing time !!"
"Positive","Just a great little gadget: I think this is a fine product. Although the instructions are a bit complex for my liking, I was able to download music and make it work great within 30 minutes. I would prefer the buttons to be recessed and the interface a bit easier to migrate from menu option to menu option, but I would buy another unit like this in a flash. The sound is great (get larger earphones) and the AA battery was a good decision on my part and on the design."
"Positive","British ZomCom? Yes PLEASE!: Knocking a star off for DVD features ONLY (lack of playable extras due to region encoding as others have mentioned); the movie itself is hilarious, a perfect blend of Shaun of the Dead and The Hangover (heavier on the former than the later, obviously). Interesting creatures and zombie ""rules"" for this one; the highest praise I can give it is that I watched this streaming first, and it was so good I had to have a copy myself."
"Negative","officejet 5610: i love this item, but the first one i bought did not work, so i sent it back and in 2 days i got the same product that works great. thank you. i love the fact that i can print,copy,scan and fax all in one. thank you so much, dave"
"Positive","Interesting and overlooked film.: More than likely if you have seen this film you are a fan of Hitchcock. I doubt this film is seen by the more casual film viewer. While by no means Hitchcocks greatest film it is a very good one. The light humor and budding relationships between Forsythe & Maclaine and Gwynn & Natwick work well in this murder mystery. The scenery is beautiful. I agree with one of the previous viewers, the theatrical trailer is cheesy. I guess the producers of this DVD could not locate the orginal 1955 trailer. The scenery in this film is, also as stated by others, beautiful. This film should be viewed by any Hitchcock or mystery fan."
"Positive","I laughed out loud!!: I think to totally enjoy this movie, you need to be 60 or close to it!! It has so much of life little problems that crop up when you suddenly realize you are turning 60!.... and it is good to laugh at life and yourself. My husband and I totally enjoyed it.... and .... That's Life!!"
"Positive","VERY VERY FUNNY: this man is so talented. not only can he write the funniest songs ever heard. he can also sing and play equally great. he writes the craziest songs. If you do not think this is funny u cant have a sense of humor. its just not possible to not pee your pants listening to this. best songs are hermaphrodite, hair, bitch, oh f*ck it...theyre all great. if you wanna laugh your @$$ off. then buy this album, you wont regret it."
"Negative","Old Product: Purchased these Lifetmaster remotes and found out they were from 2004, where the new ones you can push two remotes together and they will program the other Lifetmaster to be exactly like the other ones but when the garage company came out he said oh where did you find these old things and even though we still used them I was disappointed to find out they were old technology and have come much farther with this product and had to pay for a longer hourly rate to have it programed due to them being old :("
"Negative","Misleading photo: It's a good size and hefty material, but it does not have the gold plated look of the photo. It's a dull plastic color and looks very fake. You get what you pay for."
"Positive","Touch for health - new edition: It is a very complete edition compared to the last ones which i felt were sub standard. The only thing i would have found useful were - if the colour of the tabs represented the colours of the 5 elements. its a small detail perhaps but important to a practitioner. otherwise excellently laid out."
"Positive","Led Zeppelin, it's better than sex: magic, no band will ever come close to the long guitar solos by jimmy page, of the gut busting bass solos by none other than John Paul Jones. i mean if you don't like them you can go to mexico or something. rid us of your stupidness. all in all, zeppelin kicks ass, end of story."
"Negative","This isn't the best remake.: Nothing beats an original. This is one of the worst remakes i've seen. The actors are horrible. The only thing cool are the death and how detailed it gets in. But anyways, its a lame remake.Nothing does beat an original.""Just keep telling yourslef Its Only A Movie."". I kinda wish it wasnt"
"Negative","Has to be one of the most highly overrated authors EVER!: I just couldn't see the point of this book. The prose is turgid and overwrought. Dunnett seems to think that throwing around meaningless similies (so many I started counting them per page) and quotes in foreign languages counts for style. I read ""Queen's Play"" because someone gave it to me and found it was just as horrific."
"Positive","Variety for your kids, fun recipes for you: What I love about this book is the array of foods the author uses. I love Anabel Karmel's cookbooks, but she suggests making the same boring foods for our kids. Baby Bistro is fun, flavorful, and the recipes are so easy! I wasn't having much luck getting my son to eat different flavors and textures after eating baby food and pureed foods. Now I make a fun recipe from this cookbook each day and he eats it. Not only does he eat the recipes, he hums while eating them. That's a good thing!Enjoy!"
"Negative","ABOMINABLE: I nearly bought this thing on DVD looking at the reviews given.I rented the video and believe this mess is way below 'Street Trash'. The recommendation for its 'black humor' is not true. There is no 'black humor'.There is only 'sick' exploitation.If you have to see this thing rent it.Don't waste your money on a purchase."
"Negative","Disappointing: I heard Nora Ephron - may she rest in peace - talk about this book on the radio and couldn't wait to jump in. Getting started I thought that the early segments must be leading up to the real meat and potatoes of Beckerman's story. Unfortunately, this never came to pass. For me, the writing was thin and shallow. I kept waiting for the poignant recollections and nothing materialized. Each passage was so brief and dry - more like a sketchbook with jotted notes, just not what I was expecting. I also didn't care for the hand drawn pictures but that could be due to the resolution on my Kindle.Too bad!"
"Positive","Does what it is supposed to: Hose gives decent pressure for watering plants and coils back for storage nicely.The hose burst in two a little over a year after it went into use. Plastair customer support was quick to reply to my warranty inquiry and told me to contact Amazon for a replacement. The Amazon representative sent out a new hose (although she said it was not std. policy to do so)."
"Positive","Understanding General Semantics: General Semantics isn't a difficult cluster of concepts to understand; but to those who might have some difficulty with it, Kenneth Keyes Jr makes everything entertainingly crystal clear. Because of the constraints of their culture and language, people tend to develop unscientific and illogical patterns of thought and behavior. Learning the basic principles of General Semantics as presented by this author is the first step in addressing those problems. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in scientific and logical thinking."
"Negative","awful book, idea of fermentation is great but this book too political: This book is too political at some points, vulgar at otherpoints, and bizarre points about death towards the end of the book. I am all for fermentation but this book goes way beyond to the absurd and rediculous and strange."
"Positive","Mahler: Symphony Number 7: Accoustically great. Never heard it before so I can't compare but I could still tell that it was out of the ordinary."
"Negative","Great idea, weak book: This could have been a classic. It suffers from a number of faults which prevent it reaching that peak. It's too long (cut out 100 pages or so in the paperback to reduce to around 150) for the point which he seems to have aimed to make. According to other reviewers here, its badly edited, which may explain the sense I felt that it was a little disjointed. The idea underlying the book is that those generally identified as being on the Left are motivated in large measure by a need to feel they have a morally pure insight into, and solution for, any problem faced by a society, a trait exposed by Hollander in ""Political Pilgrims"". The idea was a good one, the book didnt, to me, live up to its promise. The reader will get better value and a far more enjoyable read, from Hayek, von Mises, James Bovard or Hollander."
"Positive","good and funny: I enjoyed this movie . Really liked Scott Caan part.He did a good job. The movie is sad and very funny."
"Negative","Definitely Shop Around: I did extensive research on the best headsets before I decided to spend my money... From Motorola, to Plantronics and finally to Jawbone. While it did have noise guard it was not to great for ear comfort nor sound quality... I even returned my 1st Jawbone because it was having some sound issues (very bad interference). They did send me another one (after a $100 hold was placed on my credit card until the return of the defective headset). When I received the new Jawbone, same problems different headset. The ear comfort was the biggest issue for me because it hurt. Sound was to low with the volume turned all the way up...I returned this headset and got the Motorola H12 and have been happy ever since..."
"Positive","Great Movie: I saw the Sneak Preview ...and the movie was great. Frankie Muniz and Hilary Duff did great jobs and portrayed their roles well. Good kids movie (James Bond for Kids and Teens). Frankie and Hilarys character both very much differ from the characters on their TV Series."
"Negative","It's ok: The tray is good, but I am trying to find a liner at home depot and the size of this tray doesn't have anything to fit it. So I just painted from the tray and throw it out after i'm done. The roller sucks so much. After using it for 3 mins, I just throw the whole thing out. Next time I will just go for better quality stuff."
"Positive","Recovery journey for those with unresolved pain inside - must read: It's difficult to list all questions Rich Buhler raises and addresses in this one book. Here are a few just to touch the base. They can be important for you or for somebody you know/love/care of. Have you ever overreacted to something and later were surprised why people were shocked with your behavior ? Why some people are so closed emotionally ? Why it's so difficult to build relations or growing relations always got stuck at some point ? Why what happens outside is usually very different of what happens inside ? Why some of us tend to avoid any risk at all or are ready to put at stake everything without any wisdom applied ? What are the important questions to ask yourself even if you think you had perfect parents and perfect childhood ? Reading and applying truths from this book can be a great journey towards recovery and resolving the most complicated challenges of person's life."
"Negative","not historically correct: do not buy this book!: Charles Reasoner is a good example of an ignorant American that knows little or nothing about Korea. His book, ""The Magic Amber"" is a legend alright, a legend in his own mind. The book is not only historically IN-correct, the illustrations contained are of Chinese with Japanese Kimonos. Come on Charles, you could have asked at least one Korean before going through the trouble of publishing a book that has nothing to do with Koreans."
"Positive","Choppy, original, and, hilarious.: Choppy and broken plot line reads like broken English (as intended). Hilarity ensues on every page. Page-turner start to finish. Russian debutantes never make appearance."
"Negative","flash in the pan: I purchased this company's first book light and had many of the same problems that others have reported -- fast bulb burn up, shoddy connections and very high bulb replacement costs. This latest version suffers from the same."
"Negative","Mammoth Book of Women's Fantasies: I got this book based on a review I read that many of the selections are lesbian themed. I was disappointed to find a lot of foot fetish fantasies. It seemed that most all of the lesbian fantasies were foot fetish fantasies. Most of the selections were not sexy to me at all, but then again I don't really care for straight erotica. I'm not sure when I think about it why I got this book. I would only recommend this book for a straight woman or a straight leaning bisexual woman, especially if she has a foot fetish. For a lesbian without a foot fetish the selections are just plain not hot."
"Positive","Interesting Historical Accounts of Interactions between Europeans and Native Americans.: This book contains many accounts of interactions between Native American tribes and Europeans. The accounts are all based on narratives written from the first arrival of Europeans until approximately The French and Indian War. It clarifies that Europeans and natives interacted in a vareity of ways and at different times were friendly or unfriendly towards each other. The French and English also brought their conflicts into the mix as the natives may have brought their conflicts too. A main concern is religion for the Europeans - The French want Catholic Indians and the English protestant ones. Alcohol was a drug easily promoted for trading purposes. When natives became hooked, the price went up. Captives with the natives were often viewed with suspicion and many English chose to live with the natives or with the French after awhile. A very interesting book."
"Negative","Someone stuffed up: This cd is advertised as ""Spencer Davis Group"". Wrong. Sung by Davis only and, believe me, without the group backing, he is not the best.Not recommended.CheersBoris"
"Positive","a modern fairy tale come true: They are from two different worlds, but some how find a need for each other. I thought Jessica, the heroine in the book was so awesome, as she helps turns this man's world around.Kamlin, the prince in the story, he really is a prince charming of sorts. I loved it. The author did a great job of bringing out the best in both characters, and I couldn't help but fall in love with them."
"Positive","Not yer mama's lesbian fiction...: Lesbian fiction was a category that we read because it was, well, lesbian. Not because it was good. Most of it was downright awful, and if approached mediocre it was like the clouds parted and the angels sang. But we kept reading and buying.The fact that this book is lesbian themed is no reason to buy it. Buy it because it is a great book. It weaves an epic story with prose that helps you visualize, smell, hear, and breath 19th century London and the life of working people, the love of families, the struggles of unconventional young women. Think Dickens, think Austen. Mostly, read this book."
"Positive","Inspitational...especially when read with a Scottish accent!: What started out as a crazy high school joke, led me to read this Scottish tale, a highlight of my friend's childhood. What I found was a great story about compromise, team work and love....the original black and white illustrations add to the overall quaintness and make this a definite must! My friends and I enjoyed it so much, that we named our team ""Wee Gillis"" in honor of Gillis' determination."
"Positive","Aquamarine Ring: I ordered the Aquamarine ring for my daughter for Christmas. It is beautiful. She wears this ring every day and treasures it. I plan on ordering another Aquamarine ring in a different style for her birthday."
"Positive","Great story: Morison was an old salt, and a very smart one. He also had a terrific store of knowledge, and it comes thru in this book."
"Positive","Good product, but pricey: I like these brush heads quite a bit - my teeth always feel very clean after use. My only complaint is that they are quite expensive. The subscribe-and-save option helps, but they're still pricey - on amazon or elsewhere."
"Negative","dear god this is horrible!!!: This is probably one of the worst grunge albums of all time, oops i mean punk."
"Positive","More than Likely: Unlikely is the second Jeffrey Brown book I have devoured (Clumsy being the first), or perhaps nibbled upon relentlessly is more apt. Like Clumsy, Unlikely is a collection of little episodes, slices of life. Brown has an unerring eye for the little inanities that make up real life... the tiny little moments that real relationships are made up of: when she looked at you from across the room the first time, when she went out to have a toke with your friends instead of staying to watch the end of the video with you, when she didn't pick up the phone because she was sleeping instead of showing up for your date... . There are no huge plot turns here, just the unrelenting incremental buildup and later crumbling of an unlikely love affair. Reading the dialogue (there is really no narrative) and body language drawn in his innocent scratchy childlike lines, we nod our heads in understanding. We have all been there. I love reading Jeffrey Brown. Try it."
"Positive","great product - TX User: I was up and running with this little device in less than 10 minutes using my iPAQ. The ability to access my home server via Terminal Server from my favorite coffee shop hangout is priceless. Highly recommended!"
"Negative","waterpik flosser: Not what I was expecting...it doesn't work at all for its intended purpose. I thought the inserts would be little brushes that would really do the job instead they are smooth and don't do much of anything."
"Negative","Not her best book: I love Anne Rice's books. I own most of them. I am a huge fan, so when I purchased this book I had high expectations. The book is about Christ's childhood, him growning up. Now it's not about his entire childhood, just a section of it. It is written beautifully, just the plot is a bit of a dissapointment. There really is no plot. It's christ and his family traveling. It can be a teadious read if you have read her other books. This is not as slow as ""feast of all saints"", but it does take a couple of chapters to pick up speed. If you are wanting a great read of Anne Rice's work the ""witching Hour"" Series is wonderful, as well as the vampire books she has published. This is a book for more determined readers, it does take a bit to plow through it. Over all it is an ok read."
"Positive","Love them, just wish they would fold for carrying: I ordered these for my SanDisc because the reviews were better than for the foldable version, and they ARE marvelous. The volume control on the cord is nice since I don't have to fiddle with the MP3 controls when I already have it on my belt. The downside is I want to carry the MP3 back and forth to work so that I have it there and at home, but carrying the headphones is a pain since they're so large. The MP3 fits in a pocket of my purse, but the headphones require that I carry a separate canvas bag which is a hassle. I'll probably break down and buy a second pair so I have one at work and one at home."
"Negative","Where's the love??: I started the series in the middle, with Dragonshadow, and absolutely loved it. It was dark and powerful, not a predictable fantasy tale where everything works out sickeningly (and unbelievably) perfect. I found Dragonsbane a little lacking, but still quite impressive. Knight of the Demon Queen, however, made me furious. At the dismal ending of this dismal novel, I got the feeling that something terrible happened to the author, and she was taking it out on her characters. Although I did enjoy the cyberpunk world at moments, overall, this novel should not have been written, unless Dragonstar is somehow able to make it all worth it... Good luck...!"
"Negative","Not FULL version!!!: I was recomended this book, and saw great reviews on it, so I decided to buy it, and hope I could get some really useful information out of it. yeah, not so much.... this is like an overview, I made the mistake of not noticing it is an abridged version. Bad on my part! I usually only buy childrens books and would've never expected this! Well, I know better now!! I'd just say, buy the full version.. this one doesn't seem to have that much useful info. I think my 4 yr old would like more than me..."
"Negative","The Old Typewriters Were Cool...: When you saw reviews for this movie, what did you think? Good movie? Predictable movie? Horrible movie? Whatever you though, you are probably right.I have spoken with lots of people who really loved this film. I thought it contrived, thinly written and not that great, to be honest. The story was nice and it left you with a warm feeling in your stomach, but it was a story we have seen a million times just put into a new setting. (Think Scent of a Woman meets Dead Poets Society.)But like I said, lots of people really liked it. I tend to think it would be more worth a cheap seat viewing or rental price, but if you thought the previews looked good, see this film. I guess."
"Negative","FROM 5 STARS TO ONE STAR: THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF THIS BOOK WAS WORTH 5 STARS, THE LAST QUARTER WAS A ONE STAR. THE LAST 100 PAGES WERE PREDICTABLE AND BORING. I FELT THE AUTHOR JUST WANTED TO GET THE BOOK OVER WITH. TOO BAD."
"Positive","Works great: I received the product a month ago and put it on our wood floor by the back door where our kids constantly go in and out to play. I immediately seen a remarkable improvement over what the floor looked like before. Now it's a month later and that test area still looks great."
"Positive","Great, low-budget mayhem!!!: If you've seen some of director Eric Stanze's more recent work like ICE FROM THE SUN or SCRAPBOOK, you might want to take a look at this fun, gory, low-budget flick.It's got a fairly complex storyline, decent acting, and above-average special make-up effects (considering the low-budget).Yeah, it's a little rough around the edges, but the moviemaker's enthusiasm for the project definitely helps push SAVAGE HARVEST beyond its budgetary restrictions.If you're a fan of indie horror, check it out!"
"Positive","Hunger Games: Loved the movie. Very good character representations, though Gale was a bit stiff. Loved the book even more, but that's normal. Can't wait til the next movie hits the theaters."
"Positive","Fast Delivery: I was pleased with the fast delivery, I ordered the black frame which i think complimented it well, it seems sturdy enough and everyone loves it...love he fact how they combined smaller pics to make up this pic"
"Positive","Good ideas: Great recipes but wish she would've omitted corn or given corn free or more soy free alternatives."
"Positive","Wonderful service: To start off, I was very pleased with the price of this product. It was very reasonable considering that I had paid much more when buying from the actual vendor. The shipping was just as excellent. I was told it would take more than a week to receive my order, but it came the very next day (although I do live quite close to where they were shipping from). All in all, I am very pleased with this seller. Perfect service."
"Negative","Not much to look forward to.: After first 5 minutes, there are not much interesting to watch. Good thing it is free when I got it, but can I return this anyway?"
"Positive","Crais rocks: Robert Crais just gets better and better. Each book adds character development and complex plots that keep you reading faster and faster."
"Negative","only charger is usefull: Charger is OK.Head phone and the cover are very poor. Not usable at all.Dont go for this. Instead go for just the charger which costs 40% less than this one."
"Positive","F'ing Hysterical!!: This book is a frickin' riot!! What I wouldn't give to hang out with Chelsea Handler for a night!! Some stories had me laughing to the point of exhaustion!"
"Negative","I only put 1 star so people would read this :-): Tolkien wrote an undescrible book and it cannot be done in any way and i think , that how his son tried to finish the whole series, is bad and he shouldn't have touched it because it's J.R.R.'s not Christopher's and he should have not killed the Dark Lord [Sauron] because evil must stay in the land of Middle-Earth because thats what gave the book meaning"
"Positive","great product: The product was shipped very quickly, especially for being around Christmas. It smells great too! Its the only scent I like my wife to wear."
"Positive","This movie is an unbelievable delight - although dark: First, let me say that no review should include the surprise shock of this movie. Beyond that, a film that has such depth and sadness, yet such perversity and humor that it evokes every emotion - if one is open to it. PLEASE see this for Hugh Grant's amazing performance, as well as Rickman, of course. This is what Grant should be doing with his time, not Nothing Hill (oh, Notting)."
"Positive","My Opinion Only: What is there not to like about Cheryl Lynn. This is a bargain deal. You won't be disappointed. Good pair.Lawrence"
"Positive","Was remastering really needed?: We all know that this was (and still is) one of rock's greatest records and a touchstone for much of the punk and indie-rock that followed over the next three decades. But,was remastering necessary? Did Stanley Clarke have a hand in this or what? The bass absolutely overwhelms Johnny's guitar on nearly all the tracks. Sure the sound is less muddy, but stick with the original release for ""The Real Ramones""."
"Negative","Love the movie, but hated the DVD: I bought this DVD solely for HONDO AND THE APACHES. I was a fan of the series around 1994 when TNT was airing it regularly. When they pulled it I missed it until this DVD came out. Boy was I sorry I bought it.The DVD looks like it was mastered from an old film print, maybe even an old VHS tape due to some of the print damage that looks like video-tape ""snow"" rather than damage to an old film print. On top of that, it should be 85 minutes long, and is only a mere 72 minutes. The quality of the other film, THE MAN CALLED NOON, is no better. I'm used to cheap budget DVDs, but when parts of the movie are missing, I have to complain."
"Negative","king of ny: Video doe not work i will be returning this product.i was ready to watch this weekn but i could the disc was no good"
"Positive","Worth reading: I read Tracy's ""Number Seventeen"" and now ""The Stowmarket Mystery,"" and I look forward to reading others by this author. Tracy should appeal to modern readers for his direct, generally unadorned style and quick-moving plots. Interestingly, despite a prose that is mostly utilitarian, you get a sometimes vivid sense of aspects of late Victorian England. If (for instance) you think that London streets were safer before the automobile was introduced, read this book.The investigator Brett is a lawyer, a professional in the mold of Freeman's Dr Thorndyke, who discovers clues and makes connections that others miss. His relationship with the police in the form of Inspector Winter is adversarial, but not without a certain amount of mutual respect (somewhat like the Furneaux/White relationship in Tracy's ""Number Seventeen"").Though I've only read 2 novels by Louis Tracy, I think he's held up better than other half-forgotten mystery writers of the period."
"Negative","meh: In some ways an interesting plot, but overall I thought the acting was average at best. The movie is fairly dark and gruesome, though it does have somewhat of a redeeming message mixed in. Also some fairly explicit sex scenes (to the line of being what some would likely consider to be pornographic). If you're mainly looking for a movie with very graphic violence then I think you will probably enjoy this to some degree. If not, then I probably wouldn't waste your time."
"Positive","Unbelievalbe: This dart board is better than I could ever have imagined. I have a real electronic dart board and with the exception of automatic scoring this is an exceptional dart board. This is a great gift for younger kids. They love it."
"Negative","piece of cake should be a piece of c***: overworked script, underworked, no name british actors, and an almost dream inducing (yawn) musical score combine to made a typically overrated brit film. about the run up and beginning of the battle of britain, this sleeper will have you taking leisurely strolls to the bathroom and the fridge. i mean, when the highlight of a five hour movie occurs in the first 2 minutes, well, you get the picture or rather..dont get the picture! YAWN !!"
"Negative","DO NOT BUY!!!!!: There is a reason this thing is SO cheap! Do not buy it! Ours failed after eight months. We had it set up as a RAID5 which we thought would be safe. Big mistake! iomega said they would replace the drive BUT WE HAD TO PAY FOR DATA RETRIEVAL!!!! Horrible service, horrible warranty! Do NOT trust your data on this machine. Check the iomega forums (which are heavily moderated for negative comments by the way, which they will admittedly remove) and you will see the problems people are having with this item."
"Negative","Beware, This Is Not For Beginners!: I like Bob Brozman and I have his ""Learn to Play Bottleneck Blues Guitar"" set but this one is really for advance players. Instead of GCEA, which is the tuning I'm starting to learn, the uke is tuned differently.My bad."
"Positive","A must-read!: This is one of my favorite books, and has been for years. If you live in the midwest you must read it! If you live elsewhere, you still must read it to find out what you're missing! There is passion on the prairie - not just corn."
"Negative","it is a good read. it's the only one for cheese lovers.: cheese is good and so is this lovely,lovely book"
"Positive","Perfect for the beginner studying the Tarot.: I absolutely adore Ms Morrison's writing and books, so I was very excited when I finally ordered this and got it in the mail. I was never very familiar with the Tarot before I read this, and after reading this, I feel that I have a much greater grasp of it. Her writing style is to the point and friendly without being too aggressively-friendly, which makes it easy to follow and charming to read. Her meditations with each card are treasured, and the spells are varied and simple to use. She also gives personal stories about her experiences with the Tarot, which help the reader (especially the beginner) to relieve any fears or doubts that they might have. Although it isn't the ""most definitive"" text on the Tarot out there, it is certainly one not to be missed."
"Negative","The king has no clothes!!: This disc just plain [stinks]. You'll listen to it once or twice and then not much after that. I give it 2 stars because it's somewhat interesting. You could use some of the material for background sounds for your video art class project, I guess. Certainly don't buy the expensive limited edition version. Wait a bit, there's gonna be tons of these at your local used record store."
"Positive","Facing abusive Christianity with tough-minded compassion: Therapists Harris and Milam seem to have their hands full dealing with cases of emotional abuse by legalistic, domineering Christian pastors, churches, or families. Speaking from long experience they share the dangers of an ""abusive"" version of Christianity, characterized by emphasis on conformity, authority, self-sacrifice, punishment, belief in an ultimate Armageddon, and ""emphasis upon the death of Christ over the life of Christ"".To deal with religion-related cases of emotional abuse, Harris and Milam attempt counseling with a spiritual dimension. Their therapy includes discussing other sides of the Bible's message, which call into question the authority of dominating individuals who claim to speak for God. It's a challenging and fascinating approach to a real mental health issue. And I think the authors tackle these issues with tough-minded compassion.--author of Correcting Jesus"
"Positive","Hard to find: I bought this set back in the eighties and have been looking for another copy for years. This was my lucky find. Hours in the car listening with my daughter or was it me listening to it with her? I never tired of it and you all know how hard that can be."
"Negative","not so good: it has no purpose.....its a hard to readboring book!?!?!? i dont find it that interesting...but i have to read it for school so what can you do?"
"Positive","Eddie at his best: This is a classic and we all know it. One of the few times where Eddie and Arsenio come together and make magic. It's got the laughs for the guys, the love story for the girls, and the kids can even watch it, with the occasional bleep. If you're a fan of Eddie, this is one of his funniest."
"Negative","Update of the old book: It was a rather frustrating book since it was just an update of the previous generation book for VC++ 6.0. It seems that SAMS wanted to be the first to sell in order to sell. This is rather bad for the company since it will lose many of its potential customers in the future. The only chapters worth reading, well at least a little bit, are chapters 19 and 21 and nothing more."
"Negative","to heavy: Why to heavy in the back end and we tried sharing the blade for hours I bought another brand it balances it self right amount of weight and shared it in about a half hour"
"Negative","Worst bags ever! I'm in tears!: I have froze over 200 ounces of BM in these bags and now that I have started thawing out milk for my son 9 out of 10 leak while thawing out. I have lost so much milk it is sickening! I spend countless hours pumping every day. I have not just wasted money. I have wasted TIME, emotion, and precious milk for my baby. DO NOT BUY."
"Positive","Great CD from Kanye: No matter how many CD's Kanye makes this will probably always be my favorite. Early Kanye, before all of the money and fame. The package came fast (I love that) and the product was in great shape, especially for a ""used"" product."
"Positive","The book that changed my life: This book was recommended to me by a therapist i was seeing for marital difficulties. When i read it, it gave me answers for 18 years of chaos in my marriage. It also gives me compassion for my husband, and resources for support groups for me. I HIGHLY recommend it for anyone feeling crazy in an interpersonal relationship, not able to understand the other person's behavior. It also helps you understand what borderline personality disorder is, since it's very complicated and each person has unique traits and different levels of each trait. What a relief to finally have some hope and some resources to help with the chaos."
"Positive","Scotchgard: Very quick delivery. Ordered on Saturday, arrived on Monday. It took two cans to cover an 8 by 10 area rug made of thistle but I don't know how well it works yet as it has been on a month with no spills or animal accidents. Maybe it is working by keeping the animals off of it."
"Negative","Gak. . .: I've been reading S.K. since 1980: I'm pretty well acquainted with his writing. Sooo. . .This book is really, really bad. The story is SO absurd (WHERE the creatures came from had to be the lowest and most perverse idea S.K. had ever had); I hated every character (wanted them ALL to die after the first few chapters)and the story itself was plodding (it took the characters about a thousand pages to travel from Point A to Point B).This was a book written just to get something new on the shelves.I was very disappointed. I can see the book on my shelf with the bookmark about fifty pages from the end; can't bring myself to finish it.I'm warning everyone away from this one."
"Positive","A truely stunning novel! -MUST READ: I couldn't put this book down! Novalee Nation goes through her new life in Oklahoma and it truley is one to read about...I found this book so in contact with my own life that it was just so much fun to read and I will never forget this one girl's story."
"Negative","It works, but not very well: The problem is that once the brewing starts, water escapes from the lid and misses the cup, and ends up on the counter. So there is some clean up involved. Keurig really needs to rethink this product."
"Negative","King kool lounge deceptive: This item is deceptive I thought I was getting two lounger but it's only one. I was not happy about that I could have gotten two for just a few dollars more!!"
"Negative","Poor: Product was marketed as new, but arrived with no packaging and a scratch across the back of the DVD. Very disappointed."
"Negative","IT WAS SO WARPED IT COULDN'T PLAYED: I had to return this DVD because it was so warped it couldn't be could not be played, and I TRYED THREE DIFFERENT DVD players!!"
"Negative","Blah: Big Jonah Hill fan but this movie is not good at all. It reminds me of the ""Adventures of Babysitting"" but far worse."
"Negative","Unrated?: I'm tired of all these movies claiming to be the Unrated Version and not offering a single thing that wouldn't be included without exception in a PG-13 movie. Add to that only seven or eight decent laughs in the whole movie and I'm pretty ticked-off. Explaining the spoofs would actually be funnier than the movie, so I won't do it.Tried and true spoof formula is not properly hashed out in cheap attempt to cash-in on quarter-of-a-century craze(Airplane 1980). Top Secret, Hot Shot, Hot Shot Part Deux and Not Another Teen Movie are much examples of this (art) form.Might have given it two stars if they left the Unrated off the box.A lot more of Josh Meyers might have helped."
"Positive","GREAT PRODUCT: I love these ....using them for hats, caps, and purses!thanks!!! received in record time! Cant wait to get them hung!"
"Positive","Great for scrapbooking!!: I just received this table, and I can already tell that it will be a great asset for my scrapbooking. The table is adjustable in height, so no matter where I am scrapbooking, I can adjust the height to fit the chair I am sitting in. The table is light enough for me to move by myself, and will fold up for easy storage. The table is also sturdy enough to use paper punches and eyelet setters. I'm thinking of purchasing another, so I can spread out even more!!"
"Positive","A Life Changer: I would recommend this to anyone I know. I'm just starting to employ the principles and ideas from the book and just starting the baby steps but I already feel better about my knowledge level and money situation. Read it, apply it, and you'll change your whole life. On my way to DEBT FREE!!!"
"Positive","Big smile!: As usual Pratchett is thought provoking AND funny.it was an easy read that belies the truth and depth of its message."
"Negative","waste of good wood: I ""played"" with this at a specialty toy store and was pretty disappointed with it. I thought I wanted this for my son after seeing it online but I'm so glad we got to try it at a store first. My toddler showed almost no interest in it. It looked hard to use and not at all fun. However, it looked like it was well made of good wood and with good stains/paint and finishes.We've had more fun with a plastic food container that I cut a square shape on the lid and my son fills it up with his wooden ABC blocks. BTW, you can do the same using matchbox cars, Peek-A-Blocks, etc. Just use a different plastic food container (yogurt, sour cream, powdered drinks, etc.) for each shape."
"Positive","my skin thanks me: I have very dry and sensitive skin and this is the only product that does just what it says it will do: moisturize all day. Amazingly lightweight, my skin just drinks it up. No other product that I've tried has made my skin feel so refreshed, including expensive lotions, which often make my skin break out."
"Negative","Incomplete, don't be fooled: Dr Yang knows his stuff and is intelligent. However this is NOT the full form, it is only 1/5 of the dvd series to fully explain the movements. This is not suitable for someone to learn the movements. It may be useful to someone that wishes to learn about tai chi, but NOT to know the movements. This is NOT A COMPLETE SERIES ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF IT. Fairly useless IMHO."
"Positive","Wonderful!: This was a gift for a family member, and they were very happy. It was the best price anywhere, very sturdy, and great visibility."
"Negative","It will be rusty before long: The size and function of this rack are great. The black finish started coming off after the first use even though it was used and cleaned pretty gently. I am concerned about getting black paint on my food and the prospect of it starting to rust very quickly."
"Negative","Don't waste your time: A pathetic ripoff of V. Sure, it's sci-fi, but it's horribly unrealistic, ie, the sheer stupidity of the characters which makes you wonder how they managed to survive in the first place. Then there's the corny dialog. The Spielberg connection should have been my first clue that this was going to blow chunks. Shame on me."
"Negative","Strong motor but poor quality.: I received an RTX-1 as a present. I was impressed by the powerful motor and cool looks. I finally had a reason to use it and found the tool vibrated almost as much as my palm sander and the cutting tool I had chucked up was not running true.Owners manual says if there is excessive vibration to rechuck tool 1/4 turn from start position until vibration goes away. The vibration did not go away no matter how or where cutter was positioned.In fact the RTX-1 vibrated with nothing chucked up and a perfectly good 1/8"" drill bit ran so out of round it was a total blur.I was able to exchange the RTX-1 for a 395 Dremel. It runs smoothly and cutters and drill bits run true. Granted it is not as powerful as the RTX-1 but what does the extra power matter if you can't control it?"
"Negative","disappointed in California: I received my sony walkman and their are no instructions that came with this product. My biggest gripe is that the stations are set to Mexicanstations and not to English stations. It's ok if you're Mexican I guess.Without instructions what the heck am I suppose to do? Send it back."
"Positive","good bag: I've used this a few times to take a suit to work. I walk about a mile each from my house to the train and train to work. I live in the south so it is often too hot and humid to walk that far in a suit. Bag works great, tri-fold design is nice as it doesn't take much more room than a briefcase. Shoulder strap is ok. Seems roomy enough for a couple of suits and shirts, etc. Would be fine for a weekend trip if you pack light."
"Negative","buyer beware: If you have the most recent version of WordPerfect, beware, this product will not install the WP8 language module on a Windows 98 platform. Apparently NT and 95 will do, but not 98. They couldn't mention this in the advertising? Duh?"
"Positive","a 5 star rating is not enough!: mariah is so great and sounds so wonderful in this album that i dun have enough of her, again she did it with pride and confidence, her voice is the big selling point, her music is heavenly and sure she is worthy the title for Queen of Pop Music, my persocal faves r : My All, When You Believe, Dreamlover, Love Takes Time, infact my faves r so many that i found it hard to choose!"
"Positive","Outstanding Teaching Tool: I teach Georgia Studies and have used this wonderful, historically accurate portrayal of my state's Civil War history. I highly recommend it to my fellow Georgia teachers and to all teachers who teach a unit on the Civil War."
"Negative","I hate this book: I really do hate this book. The plot makes no sense. How does a fish interact with ladybugs? Yeah, I get the point that it's supposed to teach counting, but the story itself is inane."
"Positive","great movie: this iz a really good movie. actings good. tha only flaw iz tha picture. itz watchable tho. this iz a classic. i highly reccomend this for anybody into old school monster flicks."
"Negative","Music to Put You to Sleep: I'm a children's librarian, so I listen to and review a lot of children's music as part of my job. Priscilla Herdman's voice is better than most children's singers' because she avoids that goofy cute sound so many children's singers have. Her voice has the same clear, high quality that her fellow folksinger Judy Collins has.However, in all honesty, I have to say this album is pretty dull. We have it in our library, but the children don't check it out. I think, this is because the song selection doesn't appeal to them. The songs just aren't ""catchy."" A parent might be able to use this album to put a child to sleep. Whether this is because the songs are soothing, or merely boring is the question."
"Positive","Glad to Have It: I went from a transfer bench to this. No more water on the floor and it fits fine in our tub. It's very solid and sturdy."
"Positive","Just my luck...: A week after ordering a refurbished 880 the price dropped $13. Oh well, I'm still love these remotes. I've actually bought three. Two new and the refurbished one previously mentioned. The latter replaced one I bought my folks 3 years ago that stopped transmitting its IR signals. But considering the almost constant use this remote is subjected to from a retired couple, I still think they are very good remotes for the price. The IR transmitter also when out on mine after 18 months of heavy use, but a call to Logitech support got me a new one in a few days at NO COST! NOT EVEN SHIPPING! And that was on a remote that was out of warranty! So, I don't understand the few reviews I've read claiming poor tech support; my experience has been anything but. I'd buy another in a heart beat! BUT, considering the IR transmitter does appear to be the weak link, an extended warranty may be a good idea even though Logitech seems to value their customers' satisfaction."
"Negative","disappointed: Normally I would love the toy for my son, but when I recieved it, it was BROKEN! The toy didn't read the letters correctly or some, not at all!"
"Negative","only warms you: I tried zestra..and honestly it just made me warm. and it smelled funny. I think ky intense works better. but to each his own."
"Negative","""NOT"" Even Better then the Real Thing: Well, I guess you can give a little credit to the ""Various Artists"" (I noticed no variations) for being brave enough to try and cover U2 songs(and no, I would not call this a tribute). However, I am not in a mood to be kind. U2 is a great band. Everything clicks with them. Nothing can change that and while the lyrics are still great, the songs are butchered. The singer does nothing but try and imitate Bono's wonderfully raspy voice and ends up sounding like a chainsaw. I can do a better job singing them in the shower. The music is loud and distracting. The Edge, Larry Mullen Jr and Adam Clayton, I imagine, would be horrified. A band that just started playing together a couple of weeks ago could do better. You get the idea. Given how dreadful it is, I am glad I borrowed a copy from a friend. I would highly recommend not throwing your money away on this. Go and buy the real deal, because nothing can compare."
"Positive","Captivating Espionage: ""Shadows and Secrets"" picks up where ""Cloaked Mode"" left off and continues to chronicle the espionage adventures of WEB Agents Attewelle and Terry. The book offers more action wrapped into more intriguing plots. The reader is in constant suspense as the cases unfold with surprises at every turn.The travels of the WEB Agents to far away and dangerous lands are eloquently depicted by Raetz's inclusion of native tongue and local customs that fully envelopes the reader. Raetz has also intricately woven the development of the characters as each story builds upon the previous stories, adding a glimpse into the lives of the WEB Agents outside the Bureau.""Shadows and Secrets"" is full of twists and turns with a bit of wit added into the mix."
"Positive","Played these before? This one is different: The only thing I can add to the other really great comments about this game is this....If you have played other online games and been frustrated, this game is different. The first thing that you will notice, no running back for your corpse! If you choose to, you can go back and pray at your tombstone to get back a bit of experience point, but it is not required. There are no item lossed, when you die, you retain all items and money you had when you died, cool, I hated 'corpse runs' for my gear.Some have said that solo playing is hard, well, I solo play and it is not hard, just takes a bit longer.The tradeskills in this game are among the best I have seen. You can take up skills such as tailoring, armourcrafting, weaponsmithing, alchemy, and more. The best part to the tradeskills is this,... there is actually demand for your products, no sitting in one spot for hours 'calling out' that you have wares for sale with no sales made."
"Negative","Lame, Don't waste your time!: Poorly written, characters that you couldn't care less about, weak plot that is so unbelievable it's not even entertaining--read anything but this book! Not worth the paper it's written on."
"Positive","LOVIN' IT!: I received this as a wedding gift from my wishlist and I absolutely LOVE IT! I've only been using it for a couple of months so I don't know how long it stays sharp, but it quickly makes perfect tomato slices. I have looked at my local Target to purchase some of these for gifts and was unable to find any so I'm back to Amazon, ordering these to give to people I know can use it, like my mom. I highly recommend this item! Even if you only slice tomatos when you're making burgers, you will love the ease and convenience this little gadget gives you."
"Negative","IT WAS A $399 GAMBLE.: One week after the warranty expired, so did the Kindle. This unit was not exposed to heat, moisture or rough handling. I turned it on one day and the entire screen was inked. I called customer service and they said they would not replace or repair it, but I could buy a refurbished one. So, I was out the $399 plus all of the books,magazines, etc. that I had purchased. It was an expensive year of reading. If they advertised this unit as prospectively a one-year-unit, they would not sell any. I would NEVER gamble again on a Kindle. I can buy a lot of books for the $ spent on a Kindle, and they won't up and vanish."
"Positive","A New Revelation: This book is awesome. I wish I would have had this book when I was going through some of my trials. The prayer at the end of every chapter is what I love the most. I often times don't know what to say in certain situations. And the prayers really helped me. I don't have to say exactly what the book says, but it supplies a lot of direction. I can't wait to read ""The Power of a Praying Parent."" My 12 year old son is driving me crazy."
"Negative","not very sturdy: The price is good but don't expect them to last long. They are comfortable but thin & I alread have a seam that is separating after about 5 weeks"
"Positive","ITS AWESOME: Big Kenny and John Rich have done made the most awesome album to date. When I first listened to it I was blown away. You will want to dance, sing and cry with this album.."
"Negative","Really awful: Poorly executed and all over the place.This game makes little sense at best. You're met with pointless missions, some new random characters, tedious tasks and a confusing power grid. When given the chance to play with other characters you're left unsatisfied and irritated.The game play isn't bad, but there is no direction at all and the plot is nearly nonexistent. The battles are very repetitive and by the end of the game you're only still playing because you want to see how it ends.It should be mentioned that in order to unlock new characters you'll need to beat the game multiple times. No way, once was enough! Another lousy Naruto game."
"Negative","Don't bother: Agree with most of the negative reviews. Baldacci's context is unbelievable and his word choices as contrived as they come. I can't believe this is the same guy who wrote Absolute Power. Moreover, I can't believe his editor still has a job. My recommendation is: don't bother."
"Negative","never trust coby again: After all the bad reviews I see for coby products, I thought _maybe_ they should have learned from their mistakes and finally make something that works. It's not a far fetched hope since this is their 2nd gen of this mp3+speaker system. But no, the unit froze on me by inserting an SD card. Turning the unit off and on again is of no help. It has a reset procedure, but only accessable from the menu, which of course is of no use since the unit is frozen. If they make crappy products, they should at least make the reset a hardware reset.."
"Negative","Thank God I rented it first.................: What a disappointment! Being a huge fan of the Gauntlet series (also by Midway) and fan of the King Arthur stories, I was stoked to play this game. Something told me to rent it before buying and I am so happy I did. The play is elementary - pure and simple - no fun. The graphics are okay but the characters you are using are so tiny you can hardly make them out (and I play on a 32"" TV)..."
"Positive","Great Camera!: Very easy to use, lightweight, perfect if you love photography. More of a starter camera, but a very good way to learn all about taking great pictures! If you are serious about photography, i would reccomend purchasing different lenses, and also lens filters (they can be relatively cheap) It enhances your pictures like you wouldn't believe!"
"Positive","Chellie's done it again!: I've been waiting for Chellie to come out with a new book since about five mintues after I finished her first one, The Wealthy Spirit. I love Chellie's positive and pragmatic approach to wealth, not to mention her sense of humor. I've turned many friends on to her earlier book, and am sure I'll do the same with Zillionaire.If you ask me, $16.95 is a small price to pay for Chellie's priceless life wisdom!"
"Positive","A Real Winner!: I bought this book for my son when he was 18 months old. He fell in love with the vibrant colors and pop-up creatures immediately! At 27 months he still asks for the ""parrot"" book regularly. We love this book so much we buy them for our friends' children and have completed our set of Snappy Pop-Up books with the other four."
"Positive","GE TL86597 InstaJack Wireless Phoneline: This item is simply the best. It replaced the first one I had used for over 15 years. Performance is consistently great! Easy to set up also."
"Positive","Well Worth the Ten Year Hiatus: I've been a fan of Ms. Anita Baker since her Songstress debut and it has just gotten better and better with each album. Her latest, 'My Everything,' is just a testament to this lady's impeccable knack for wrapping herself around a song and delivering it in the Anita way, no matter how long it has been since she recorded. 'My Everything' is like having warm peach cobbler topped with Vanilla Bean ice cream when you've had nothing but tofu bars for the last eighteen months. It is decadent and filling, without being overly rich, all at the same time. The music industry has far too long been inflated with Beyonce and Ashanti derivatives; I am glad that Ms. Baker felt obliged to grace us once again with her voice. If you like good music, this album is a must buy!"
"Negative","order never arrived: The book I ordered never arrived. I checked tracking and DHL passed it off to USPS who delivered it somewhere on 12/28/07. The end result is ""Sorry Charlie"""
"Positive","Very well written: I thought this book was okay! It needed more suspense! But if you love Mary-Kate and Ashley Olson a lot you should read this book! The plot was faboulous! Great Book! Read it!"
"Negative","Don't Waste Your Money: I don't usually write reviews, but I feel so strongly that this one is awful, that I feel obligated to warn future buyers to keep your credit card in your purse when it comes to this one! I am an avid yoga/fitness DVD athlete -- have been doing yoga for over a decade, have run two marathons: I know my stuff.You could make a case for the yoga routine being a good one, but I find that the production is so awful that I can't hear the instructors voice, so I constantly have to bend out of positions just to look at the TV screen to see what she's talking about. Not to mention the camera shots of her tush and close ups of her inner thighs are just disgusting. She's very fit and toned, but I just don't want to see anyone up that close.If you want a yoga routine that makes you think you might be learning from a strip-dancer, go ahead and spend the 50+ bucks on this one."
"Negative","Book should be in pulp fiction section: I bought the book because I was familiar with some of the people involved in the story. I also threw it away without finishing the book. It was poorly written, the story rambled, the author took many liberties in filling in his own version of details of people and events, and it seems like much of the facts were taken from court documents instead of interviewing the people involved.In short, don't waste your time."
"Positive","You Won't Even Care Who Done It!: I couldn't put this book down for one minute. I read it as I walked. In the end, I didn't even care who the killer was, it was the other characters that I wanted to read about. Hooper outdid herself with this one. All I can say is I can't wait until I can read more about Bishop and Randy and Bonnie. The love story was so intense, I never wanted it to end."
"Positive","You need this.: I've never bothered to write a review before, even with albums I really like. Although, this Big Star album has to be one of the best records I've ever heard....& I've heard quite a few! It is really incredible. Great songwriting, great guitar playing... a really fun, turn it up & have a good time record. It has some really good rocking tunes, & some mellow tunes, but they're ALL really, really, really good. Everyone should own a copy of this CD. That's it."
"Negative","Don't buy this item!!!!: I bought this item (Sony D-FJ041 CD Walkman portable CD Player with AM/FM Turner) because my original Sony finally stopped working after 8 years of no problem usaged.The first two times I used this new Sony player it worked ok the sound was a bit off but adequate. Then the third time I used it would not turn on at all I changed the betteries and put new ones in and nothing happened. It is piece of junk and past the 30 day point of no return.I don't understand why Amazon is carrying and selling such poor quality mechandise.I hope Amazon reads this and take it to heart.I'm not very young and not in turn with MP3 or IPOD players and I have nothing Portable to use to play all my CD's on when I go on walks.Would not reccomend this cd player to my worst enemy!!!Dissatisfied consumer."
"Positive","SWEET CD: This cd rocked. It cusses alot so I would get the edited version. My favorites are Nookie and N 2 gether now. They are 2 sweet songs. I would get this cd. If you liked the 1st cd, u will love this cd. Peace"
"Negative","The Princess Knight book review: This book is just okay. The knight is not even mentioned in the story. And there ain't no princess either. Now come on, who writes a book with no princess or a knight if it is in the title? I believe that what is in the title should be included in the story. Maybe I am wrong. When I read Dr. Seuss books, if the book was The Cat and the Hat, there was a cat and a hat mentioned in the story. This story is just ""different."" Most of the books that I have read, mention the words that appear in the title. The books that don't, I usually don't enjoy. If you want to read a book like this, go ahead. I still enjoyed this book. But, nothing can compare to some of Cornelia Funke's other books, such as the Theif Lord."
"Negative","Not a Navajo voice int the bunch: The story is generally carried along by short conversations. but the voices do not change. I had to see who said or replied to know who was speaking. In good writing each character carries their own voice through the novel - that is how we get to know them. This does not happen here. The only interesting part is the knowledge about medicine herbs. I guess if one has never read a novel about Native Americans, either modernists or traditionalists, or better yet gotten to know a few, this might be a good start. But every culture carries its own language and thought patterns and to capture that is the trick of good writers. Hillerman of course comes to mind (as does Faulkner with an entirely different kind of ""unbeknown"" culture) - we know who each character is just by the way they phrase things."
"Negative","What a bummer!: I am also a fan of Becky Kelly and have bought the calendars in the past with the beautiful ribbons. I was disappointed when I got this year's calendar. It didn't have any ribbon to tie and there were very noticeable glue spots that had stained not only the pictures themselves but the each of month pages as well."
"Positive","Faith Hill / Take Me as I Am: Classic Faith, one of her first Cd's, not her best, not her worst. I recommend this Cd."
"Positive","beautiful: This is a very inspirational book for stumpwork enthusiasts. I have made many projects from this book, and use it as a cross reference when using other patterns, as Jane's techniques are often easier and give better results. Hopefully for most embroidery enthusiasts it won't prove too difficult to understand as her instructions are very clear and precise. She has alternative lists of materials at the back of the book if you can't find the threads she recommends, and one of the nice things about her books is that she encourages people to take the initiative to be bold and use materials you might find hidden in your sewing box at home."
"Positive","Great Family Film - beautiful scenery: Fun movie for the whole family - if a little predictable, the gorgeous scenery makes it well worthwhile. I grew up watching these films and still enjoy them. When I was small, the wildlife and mountains thrilled me; now as an adult mom, I must admit watching Robert Logan holds a bit more than a passing interest!"
"Positive","HP 12C: This is my 3rd 12C. (The first one got crushed, the second had a bad keyboard.) It's a workhorse financial calculator, the Platinum edition is faster and more powerful. It should last the rest of my life (I'm 68). Unconditional recommendation."
"Positive","Life Changing: Although I never knew it by name, I was aware of the Gerson Therapy for many years and wouldshare what I remembered hearing about with anyone who would listen even though it was'nt untilI saw ""The Beautiful Truth"" that I finally got the whole story.The information enclosed in ""The Beautiful Truth"" can and should be life changing and makesperfect sense and confirms the adage ""You are what you eat.""Of course, changing a long developed lifestyle for the sake of one's health is'nt as easy as it soundsand long developed bad habits are'nt either. Rather, it should be construed as growing a plant froma single seed. The correct elements: water, sunlight, nutrition etc. will grow a full, healthy plant and product beautiful flowers and ripe delicious fruits.The DVD points out this scenario for the human body and provides enough legitimate informationfor the viewer to absorb and decide for themselves.I highly recommend it."
"Positive","Reasonably Priced Replacement: This is the exact same battery that Palm installs in the Treo when you purchase it. The cost is significantly less than purchasing from Palm. I have not had any problems with the battery since I installed it."
"Positive","night before chtistmas: great christmas book. just like the one i had as a child. my kids love it. given as shower gifts and new to be moms enjot the book"
"Negative","BEWARE!: This item is not returnable, even though the seller doesn't mention that in his description. This is not what I was anticipating and now I'm stuck with it.Very disappointed..."
"Positive","unbelievable: Unbelievable- if it wasn't bad enough I've been listening to her CD nonstop now I'm watching the DVD nonstop too. How does an 11 year old sing with this level if interpretation and emotion? A true gift from God. I hope she and her family will be able to avoid the pitfalls of fame and the music industry and she remains at heart a normal child. I have 3 daughters and listening to her just moves me to no end ans makes me appreciate my daughters even more."
"Positive","Cool Game for Non-Gamers!: I don't like playing games much, but my son does -- he is only 7, but I bought him this Pirates version of Life because I didn't want a ""baby"" version like SpongeBob (from Amazon reviews). I wasn't disappointed. This is a very cool game and all his older cousins loved it! He loved it, too, once all the rules were established and somebody just has to read the cards for him. Everything is in Pirate dialect and the graphics are done nicely.I was pleasantly surprised to find that I can tolerate playing this game because it has some fun surprises and direction changes along the way."
"Positive","A dark hard hitting drama: This gripping story about mixed up teenage basketball star Jim Carroll shows Leonardo Dicaprio at his cinematic best. With friends Mickey, Pedro and Neutron Jim swaggers around New York city like he owns the place. Their lives revolve around basketball and drugs and in the end it catches up with them all, leaving the penniless junkies battling to survive on New York's mean streets."
"Negative","This is the worst pocket pc hp has created.: I bought this back in October. I had thought it would be like the others. First of all, this thing has no memory whatsoever. I had to buy a memory card just to do stuff. Second, it doesn't have built in wifi so I can't go on the Internet without it saying 'Memory to low, click a task to terminate'. I wish that ipaq's would come with more games than just Solitaire and Jawbreaker. If this is priced at more than 50 bucks, don't buy it. I bought mine on ebay for $155, and now I'm just pissed!"
"Positive","Best cleaner ever!: This product is the only one that will remove oily stains from my family's clothes.There is nothing else quite like it!"
"Negative","Love your babies...: Tracy Hogg sound like a selfish person who only wants to get rid of her kids so she can write more books and make more money. You should pick up, hug, cuddle, and love those little ones and don't ignore them because if you do you will get spoild brats."
"Positive","One of my favorite movies: OK, I don't know why I love this movie so much but it touches me every time I watch it. It is the only movie I have ever actually purchased. Maybe because Georges is so uncool and so loveable I just want him to get the beautiful girl. This is really a ""feel good"" movie."
"Negative","Not very good: For the amount that these cost over regular wiper blades I was expecting something amazing. At first they worked quite well but the quality of the wipe deteriorated quickly. After carefully cleaning them using rubbing alcohol they start to work better but it doesn't last long. I'm sticking with cheaper wiper blades next time since they last just as long and do just as good of a job."
"Negative","not happy with the quality: I bought this seat cover to reduce the hardness of my original seat to my hybrid bicycle. After only two days of using this cover, the stitching began separating on the stretch material which goes around the perimeter of the seat. I returned the product for a credit ... not worth the price."
"Negative","Buyer Beware: These are not Ruth Draper recordings: This CD is by a contemporary actress doing her own version Draper."
"Negative","Not real wood: I would have given it 3 star if it's not misleading in product description. And I did not expect it come with a good workmanship at the price."
"Positive","nice light for commute: I bought this after going thru my 2nd Nite Rider set (bad wiring). It is plenty good for both seeing and being seen, as a matter of fact, it is a lot brighter than the $160 Nite Rider I replaced. I bike along an unlit 10' wide path that is oftentimes littered with fallen tree limbs, etc. It is great on even the darkest and rainiest rides. Battery life so far real good, I've used it for 5 hours so far, and it uses 4 AA's, so I will replace the alkaline AA's provided with it with 2600 MA NiMH rechargeables. This is a well built little light at a great price!"
"Negative","WRONG ADAPTER: The website said it fits my car but the Nissan Juke takes a large J-hook adapter and the blade comes with a small J-hook adapter."
"Positive","The Best and last B2K album: Well I'm one of the many die hard fans and so I speak the truth when i unfortunately inform you all that they have breakin up. As far as I know this is the last album they will do as a group. and it's amazing...The vocals are better and they take it up a notch by announcing their arrival as men with edgier and mature lyrics.All the songs are hit's but there is on that particulary stands out for me""Sprung"" =It's beautiful. This album deserves nothing less than 5 stars"
"Negative","EYES WANNA SHUT!: THIS MOVIE SUCKED IN MORE WAYS THEN ONE. FIRST OF ALL, TOM AND NICOLE ARE ENDLESSLY TRYING TO KEEP THE MEDIA OUT OF THEIR ""BUSINESS"" SO THEY DO WAHT---MAKE A HOME PORNO? I LOST RESPECT FOR THESE TWO TALENTED STARS. TOM HAS MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 TO BOUNCE BACK ON. NICOLE IT IS GOING TO TAKE AWHILE TO REGAIN ANY RESPECT YOU HAD IN THE INDUSTRY. YOU DIDN'T JUST PLAY A PART. YOU PLAYED A SLUT, WHO WAS MARRIED, AND INVOLVED A CHILD. THIS MOVIE HAD COMPLETLEY NO MORALS, AND WASN'T AT ALL SEXY. KIDMAN AND CRUISE HAD LITTLE SCREEN TIME TOGETHER, MOST OF KIDMAN'S SCENES ARE IN FLASHBACKS OF SEX WITH A SAILOR...GOT IT..LET'S MOVE ON...IT DIDN'T...SO I AM ASSUMING THAT WAS WHAT THE MOVIE WAS ALL ABOUT?"
"Negative","Items Did Not Come Yet: I am still waiting for my magazines, I have not even gotten the first one that was supposed to already have been shipped out"
"Positive","A good recording, but the best ever?: Maybe hearing all the superlatives before actually hearing this recording made me expect too much, but I just can't see what all the fuss is about. Granted, the singing is quite good, but I've heard better portrayals of all the roles on other sets. I'm a huge Sutherland fan, and on this set I even found her lacking. I suspect I'll be lambasted for my heretical views, but I just don't think this is the greatest recording of Don Giovanni I've heard."
"Positive","Kick butt mystery: My first read of Mariah Stewart's novels, Until dark held me in suspense throughout the book, page by page. From beginning til end, I had a suspicion who the 'baddie' was, but getting t the end was a wonderful experience.For those of you who hate the idea of reading a romance novel... take heed. I didn't realize this was classified as a romantic suspense until I was within 50 pages of the end when a co-worker pointed it out to me. As good as any of the main-stream suspense writers out there in my opinion. A great read!!!"
"Positive","Wonderful!!: I adored this movie.I thought it was funny, touching, and downright sexy.The love scene in this movie is so understated, but oh so sexy...and just adorable.You'll love it.I wouldn't steer you wrong."
"Negative","Parachutes: I was very disappointed with the purchase. The seller described the product to be in ""like new condition"". I anticipated receiving the disc in the original packaging (along with the cover)as though it were purchased brand new from a store. The disc itself was in fine condition. However, it came in a clear plastic case. I don't think the cd should have been advertised as being in ""like new condition."" The music by Coldplay is great and the disc is definitely worth purchasing, particularly if you like all of their other cd's but don't own this one."
"Positive","Darn great book: I have been riding for over 40 years. As most of us I have gotten lazy about the basics. This is a great book not only for a new rider but even the more experienced one.the short chapters and the antidotes point out that riding bikes is both fun and dangerous at the same time. It expands on the MSF guide book and would be a great addition to any one's library.Ed"
"Positive","Works pretty good: I used it in a steam cleaner and it worked pretty good. Had to go over the carpet area 2X though."
"Positive","Great strategy game: If you like games like Final Fantasy Tactics or Warcraft, then you should love this one. The main reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is that the game only stores stats and progress for a single player (ie. someone else can't start their own campaign without erasing yours), plus the game isn't terribly difficult or long to beat- although it has tons of variety, multiplayer maps, and characters to play as."
"Negative","Was ok for 6 months: This printer was fine until I changed cartridges and a contact was dirty. Now it won't quit printing alignment pages all the time. I have about a million now, and its cost me a fortune in ink. Every 3 or 4 print jobs and I get another one.I've spent hours with technical support, who keep leading me through the same old song and dance, disconnect the usb cable, hit some buttons, print another page I don't need, and scan. Voila it works! Case finished.NO IT IS NOT.The tech support people don't speak English and it shows in their grammar and inability to understand that my problem seems to be a variant on what they have in their knowlege base.HP would do better to hire native English speakers. I'll never buy another HP printer.Oh, they print fine, that is, if you want a million alignment pages."
"Positive","great: This movie was a one of a kind collerts item to get if you are a big angel fan. It comes with 6 full disks of great non-stop actont hat every one would love. I have just wached all the shows and it is great you would not belive how wonderful it is."
"Positive","Great Condition - Wonderful Book: Although the buying information indicated that this book was used, I believe that it was brand new! It is in absolutely wonderful condition. The book itself is great, too, but, being translated from French, there are definitely some interesting phrases to say the least"
"Negative","Not sturdy...lasted 2 days before breaking!: This highchair is adorable but it is a piece of crap! My two year old got it for christmas and its already break just a few days later. The tray ripped off from the highchair just from opening and closing it. While my husband can wood glue and clamp it, the quality is obviously not there. I would pick a different option, since this only lasted a few days. If it were better quality, it would have been a great choice because it fits her babies great and it was easy for a two year old to get her babies in and out."
"Negative","WHEEEERES THE BEAST??: Hero--tortured, yes. Beast, No--and for that, I was very disappointed. I guess ""beast"" was what the townspeople thought of this unknown, unseen ""dragon"". The heroine was quite spunky--that I liked; however, I never quite understood why she was the only one who could read or who had any semblance of intelligence in that town. This story was not what I would call a beauty and the beast type tale, although the reader is lead to think it is throughout most of the book. Shame, shame!!! Romantic interludes between the heroine and the hero happen very near the end of the book, and you MUST use your own imagination--nothing explicit here. What should have been a dramatic coupling for them was a real let down for me. For those who like this type of tepid, sweet, kisses type of romance, this will probably be a good book. For those who like their romances on the steamy side, forget this book. For those who want a true beauty and the beast story, skip this book. For me? Not my cup of tea."
"Positive","This unit is excellent!: I love this surge tap. It has a higher protection value than any other unit I have found in it's price range. Best of all, the plugs rotate to the side eliminating the ""bulge"" you usually have with six plugs and transformers. I put one of the legs of my computer table in front of this unit, pluggs turned to the side, and it almost has disappeared. I think it is a great product and a great design!"
"Positive","Impressive for the price: I bought the CA 4100 system for my second desktop PC. On my first I already have a set of Altec Lansing THX 120 watt speakers. Compared to those, the 4100 doesn't show much of a difference, except for high treble notes, which seem to be cut off, but hardly noticeable. These work best on a 4.1 channel sound card and above, on a 2.1 the left and right surround speakers are very weak and use the same channels as the left and right front. This can only be heard when the surround speakers are placed close to the ear. Overall, excellent fidelity and ambience, impressive bass, and true surround accompany this system, which is one, if not the, best in it's price range. Keep up the good work CA!"
"Negative","Boring: I borrowed this movie because it looked good, but when i saw it im like what is this, I didnt like this movie at all the first 10 min is good but then its got boring rite after."
"Negative","Totally ""Out Kold"" Before The Fight Was Over: I couldn't take the slowness of this film. I was really diggin' the script, but the actors (that's a whole different story). The characters lacked movement and expression. There's not much anyone can say after seeing this movie. ""Good intentions - bad outcome"", I reckon."
"Positive","I,TINA review: I like this book everytime I get a chance I read it again and again because I could not believe the thing's Ike put her through. I wanted to cry I had felt so sorry for her. anyone who does not have this book get it it will be worth your money. I am so happy Tina is away from Ike for good and being able to do what she love."
"Negative","Not a story: Beware!! This is not a novel!! If you want an engrossing read and you want the girls from sex and the city, do not let this fool you. This book is more of an essay. Paragraph after paragraph of what appears to be the newspaper column maybe. Not novel format at all. I was real disapointed because I enjoyed Lipstick Jungle and Trading Up and Four Blondes. This book is nothing like them."
"Positive","GORGEOUS ISLAM: Simply a spectacular book. The text is fascinating and the images are first rate. The art and architecture of Islam is elegant and beautiful, obviously when you think of Islamic Architecuture of this period you think of the Taj Mahal, which of course, is one of the most spectacular buildings in the world, but there are so many others. This book will make you really appreciate the Architectuere and Art of this wonderful religion. Highly recommended."
"Negative","I haven't read the book, but the author should investigate.: The OKC BOMBING was the result of extreme hatred created by a series of events. The murder of Randy Weaver's wife and son, WACO, and most important, the destruction of Iraqi by American smart bombs. Nichols and Mcveigh acquired the materials taking almost six months. John Doe 2 an Iraqi, built the bomb in an old white truck (later transferred to a Ryder) with the help of an Islamic Jihad terrorists cell from the Middle East and concealed by local jihad in OKC. Killing children was the plan for John Doe 2. His hatred was uncontrolable. I was a witness to the events surrounding the bombing. There were Americans that hated the Federal Government that wanted to destroy the Murrah Building. The Iraqi's actually did the job with a truck driven by Tim Mcveigh."
"Negative","Nice toy but too big for a small dog.: After reading the reviews I thought this would be a nice toy for my miniature dachshund who loves any plush toy that squeaks. She was very excited when I pulled it out of the box and squeaked it but once I gave it to her she had a really hard time getting her mouth around it and squeaking it herself. She picks it up once in a while but I can tell its not one of her favorites because it takes too much effort for her small mouth to squeak it. Probably better for a medium size dog."
"Positive","gotta have a little faith, eh?: This is a greatest hits collection, spread over two CDs, including hits from GM's Wham! days. It's great for listening when reading, or reflecting back on the days when we all had mousse or gel in our spiky hair. Careless Whisper is an old friend, as is Freedom 90, but a couple of songs are missing here (Somebody to Love, with Queen, and my guilty fave, I Want Your Sex). An enjoyable collection nonetheless."
"Negative","Major letdown: We absolutely loved ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" (I highly recommend it) but this is nowhere near as good. Most of the story is just rehashing the original book, with a little politically-correct ""let's ship the extra food to the hungry"" thrown in. Lame."
"Negative","Quite weak for Turtledove: I'm rather a fan of Turtledove's work, but this one left me mostly annoyed. The conceit is amusing, but the meticulous attention to detail that Turtledove uses so well in his alternate histories serves him poorly here. The inside jokes about LA, in particular the San Fernando Valley, are fun; and the mechanics of the world are well thought out -- but the result is somehow tedious; I found myself turning pages to get the punch line, rather than savoring each page as I did with (for example) his Civil War books.I'm disappointed. It sure won't stop me from scooping up other Turtledove books, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone either."
"Positive","2016 Movie: I found this movie to be very informing. You have to go with your ""gut"" feeling toward Obama. I did not vote for him the first time around. It was my gut feeling. I will not vote for him this time around. Not a Romney fan, but something has to change and not Obama's change. In my opinion, Obama does want this country to go down."
"Positive","Poetic revelation: This little book takes about 40 minutes to read. It is not what you might expect. It is not a minute by minute account of what happened during the bombing. It does not give statistics or even mention many things about the appearance of the city or many of the horrifying things that happened. It is a revelation of what it felt like to lose everything. And it is truly beautifully written. Few people can write poetically much less translate poetically."
"Negative","No ! Not for me ! Thanks.: I just wanted my wife to try it on her wrist in a drug-store...Rite Aid,Osco,Walgreen,Eckerd,don't remember,it was Christmas time.It smelled just OK but after one hour or so it was...gone.That usually happens with cheap fragrances."
"Negative","Arrogant political trash posing as an unbiased novel: Crichton writes in the book that everyone has and agenda except him. Please. If I could give this book a zero, I would just for that lie. He is pushing his obvious agenda on his readers. Funny, for a guy who has no agenda, he fails to mention any concerns at all about industrial pollution doing anything to the environment. Evidently it is only environmentalist and ecoterrorists who do damage to the environment. He even manages to toss in that silcone breast implants don't cause cancer, so keep sticking those fake boobs in girls. Crichton likes them. I used to like his novels, but this book reads like he is desperate to get back on top, so politically fanatic he couldn't control himself or vying for a lucrative paying job at Fox News."
"Positive","Dyson DC17 Animal: Great vacuum, but the attachments will not stay attached to the vacuum. Design flaw?"
"Positive","Southernplayalisticadillacmusik: Ill admit I was a little disappointed that there are only 3 new songs on this CD, but that all passed when I started spiinin it. The new songs are great, and the old tracks are classic - they picked the perfect mix of them to put on here, and showed everyone what Outkast is all about. If you have all the Outkast cds, dont bother getting it since it is almost completely old songs. If you dont have any or all of the Outkast albumd though, buy this for sure - what are you waiting for? Go get it!"
"Positive","The keeper of the bees by Gene Stratton Porter: This is a heartwarming story, well written, which helps to restore one's belief that people can be upright and supportive of one another, underpinned by a faith in God."
"Positive","Delightful: Smells wonderful, not too overpowering. I apply it behind my ears, or neck and wrists, smell lasts the entire day. Ships right away!"
"Positive","Teenage Confirmation: I purchased this book for my trendy 14-yr old daughter. She received the book on a Friday and read it over the weekend. It has been two weeks since she started following the instructions, and she insists that her hair feels healthier. It even feels stronger. If this book could captivate a technology-crazed teenager, it is worth the read."
"Positive","Awesome blu-ray: I could not be happier with this blu-ray. The price was very reasonable and the disc contains a lot of material."
"Negative","Syrupy and simple: Bono's vocals are troubling in this album. Some of the songs sound like they came right out of the 1960s! The songs are rambling and almost 'forced' and exasperated, and lack intensity and passion, two things Achtung Baby was loaded with.This is NOTHING like Joshua Tree, either."
"Positive","Great First Purse!: I bought this for my daughter (21 months at the time) for Christmas so she would stop trying to carry my purse around all the time, and it was a GREAT buy! It has lots of great goodies for kids to play with, and my daughter loves to carry it around. I only have 2 complaints: (1) the phone buttons cannot be pressed. I am fine without them having batteries or making noise, but it is irritating that they can't even be pressed. My daughter got frustrated pretty quick with that. (2) The little wallet is hard for kid fingers to open, so it is pretty much worthless. My daughter stopped playing with it almost immediately.Aside from those two things, I think this purse is great - the pieces are durable and fun and it is just the right size for my toddler."
"Positive","Norah Jones - Come Away with Me: Good Album for a long, rainy night when you cant sleep & want to relax & wind down from a hard day. No, I'm not saying it'll put you to sleep! Just relax you enough when you need it most."
"Negative","it just does not work: I am still puzzled how they got the photo on the product packaging that shows bright colored beams of light covering the room. That's NOT what you see. The effect is nothing that spectacular. The refraction patterns are barely visible. Piece of junk."
"Negative","Boring, tedious and oh so many words: Why write a 716 pages ""thriller"", which does not start ""thrilling"" until page 148 and even then is just one cliche after the other. The author being American the story is mainly about English people and the chararcters are all paper thin (Englishmen go to Eton and say ""old chap"", they dine in the Ritz, bla, bla). Who are reading these books? Housewives in Idaho who never had a chance to cross the state border? I gave up halfthrough and I will never know who the traitor was! Oh, gosh. Yawn, yawn. How about no stars at all.............."
"Positive","Space opera with depth: Most space opera only covers big guns and bigger ships. This series does that and more with aplomb. Definitely recommended."
"Negative","Great until the seams fall out/Big Safety concern: Got this product three months ago and had fun until the seams came out of it. The manufacture will not fix the problem and recommended a seamtress in the area to get it fixed. Wow this must mean they get this issue a lot. The seams came out below the ladder and created a big hole and let the air out. Thank god my three and two year old were not at the top when this happened. Do not buy this product the seams will come out and someone will probably get hurt sooner or later."
"Positive","Good movie.: This is one movie that,if you really look at it,isn't hilarious...but,it's funny in its own way! It's about a college fresham,Clark (Matthew Broderick) going to film college for the first time. When he is looking for the subway,he trips over a homeless man and gets helped up by some guy. The guy offers to drive him to the college and Clark finally agrees after some time. When they reach their destination,Clark gets out and goes to the trunk to wait for the guy to open it...as soon as Clark is around,the guy drives away with all the stuff in the trunk. A while after he sees that same guy walking down the street and he chases,catches,and tells him to give his stuff back. The guy didn't have his money but MOST of his clothing. The guy told Clark that he could give him a job paying $500 a trip. That's where Clark gets himself into trouble,not realizing what he was doing. This is a funny and cute movie. I would recommend this if you are bored and looking to watch a movie that'll relax you."
"Positive","Great Book!: My daughter loves it and now she can better grasp the importance of know when and how to call 911. So I think it is a must have. Very educational."
"Negative","awful!: these gloves are very thin but more importantly, they become sticky--I mean the latex sticks to itself! If used for cooking or cleaning the gloves just deteriorate into a sticky mess. I'm going to see if I can return these terrible things. hope so."
"Negative","Doesn't work: Received this as a gift. No instructions and no tape for remote in box. Stand for table top was already attached. Does not receive signal for atomic clock. Looked like it was a return that someone just sent out again."
"Negative","I like three songs: Maybe I should have listened to the CD more? I just couldn't get into this albums rhythm. Some songs were boring or just drawn out with annoying bellowing. I felt like the growth was forced, and the album might have been rushed. I suggest legally downloading the tracks you like. His first album was miles ahead of his second and third. I suggest that, MOS, commits to making a quality album while only concentrating on the music and not the movies."
"Positive","strange and beautiful band: it's very safe to say that Cranes are a unique band. the music is simple and sometimes very stark with minimal elements that add a touch of fragile beauty. their unique appeal is only strengthened by the vocals, which at times, sound like a frightened child. Cranes have created a musical landscape that borrows from the composer Satie, Cocteau Twins, and maybe even a little bit of Velvet Underground. but they have twisted all these elements into a form and shape that is all their own. a challenging listen that is worth investigation."
"Positive","not bad - 3 and a half stars: Well, as much as I dislike Katie Holmes and her squeaky voice, I got this to fill the girlie movie requirement of a rental night marathon. Forest Whitaker does have a touch with female-skewed movies. The movie was rather cute, actually. Although I wish Katie's ribs weren't showing while she was wearing the blue bikini in the beginning - why oh why can't actresses these days have a little meat on them? - she played the role with charm. And there was certainly good chemistry between her and Marc Blucas (who I had no complaints about on viewing him sans sweatshirt). The whole thing had feel of a modern fairy tale - which was obviously intended and not a bad thing. Feel-good, enjoyable escapist fare. And we all need a getaway sometimes."
"Negative","It's all Plastic!!!: It appears from the color to be made of metal but it is cheap plastic, if I would have known this I would not have bought it! I have a Kubota ZD326 mower and the blades are very thick. This balancer does not work well with commercial blades"
"Positive","Waltons Irish Whistle: I really have not found a difference in the various companies that offer the Irish Tin Whistle. Price doesn't seem to matter much in making your choice. They still all sound the same. Difficult little instruments to master (I'm still working on it). Since they are so inexpensive, try one of each and see if you like the sound of one more than the other. Then, if you find yourself researching further you will have an idea of what the various name brands represent. Or, check with a music master before buying. That certainly isn't me. Otherwise, just buy the Walton and enjoy it."
"Negative","As a dedicated fan, eben this price isn't worth your time: I have avidly pursued numerous VU albums. In addition to owning all of their released material, I have acquired bootlegs and unreleased tracks. This album was a trumendous diappointment. The Velvet Underground lost their magic after breaking up following the release of Loaded. All members of the band have remained talented. But together again after so many years, this Velvet Underground's recording is a painful experience, a harsh reminder of a vibrance that once existed and is no longer there. My advice is to stick with the original recordings or old live ones."
"Positive","Handy little speaker: I like this speaker for use on my ipod classic. It works well to allow my children to watch videos and not have to use headphones. It isn't too loud...which for others might be a con, but for me is a pro. The kids can watch and hear just fine. It is very handy and stores easily in my bag."
"Positive","Cooking Made Easy: Gayle's Legacy is a unique format for a cookbook. It is full of little personal tibits, which make the recipes special. I have found the recipes easy to follow and the end results excellent. My special Christmas cookies are all from this book, as well as many of my favoite meals. I have purchased this book for my three sisters-in-law who all loved it. And, they are not just telling me this as when I visit I can't help but notice that the books are well worn."
"Positive","Big, but secure!: It took a little getting used to, but I wouldn't want to use my Canon G-11 without it now! Feels secure on my wrist. I also love the fact that I can keep it on my wrist even while the camera is securely in its case! The case I use for my G-11 is theTamrac 5689 Pro Compact Digital Bag (Black)... works out great for when I want to tuck the wrist strap inside the case as well."
"Positive","Greaet Time piece show: Its a captivating story that holds interest for both those that find joy in time piece movies and shows and those who want a romance story. While the romance part does nothing for me I really enjoy the look back at a time before in a life style that was always looked upon. The characters are great and all bring a different life to this show. Maggie Smiths one liners and her character in this show are the reason I keep watching."
"Positive","Aftershock: a heartwarming series ender of junior year: I've bought aftershock after I've got the first two books:last wish & earthquake. This book exemplifies the struggle of all characters as they face a disaster that will change their lives forever. I find the book heartwarming because the characters takes a look back on the past-the love,friendships and their trials. This shows the strong bond between the Wakefield twins-Jessica & Elizabeth and their love for their family and friends. I highly recommend this book to the other readers not only for entertainment purpose but also for a guide through teenage life as well."
"Negative","Couldn't even finish this one: I totally agree with the other one star reviewers. I only fought part-way through the book before I pushed it aside in disgust. While a fiction work, the main character is supposed to give you a sense of who John was. The book portrays him as a hot-headed legalistic old man, quick to anger, cowardly, and needing to be led by those he had mentored. Where are his fruits of the Spirit? Where is the wisdom he would have from walking with the Master all those years? The words he spoke in the book were drivel. If you want a good fiction book to read (sorry I can't vouch for the historical accuracy) try Francine Rivers Mark of the Lion series. It's a three part series. I highly recommend the first two books."
"Positive","Cocoa Krispies-Convienently Kwick: great for a quick breakfast or to throw in backpack just in case its needed-96 packs in one box means no fighting over the cocoa krispies in the variety pack"
"Positive","Best over the ear phones for under 25 bucks: The headphones are light, loud, and clear. I have big ears and they fit completely inside the pad. This means I can literally sit for hours and work on my computer at night and my roomates don't hear my music. That goes double for movies and games with explosions and gunfire. You literally dont realize that they are there. The headphones are very light, and very adjustable. Some people consider the plastic constructions a negative feature, but honestly i throw them on my desk, I abuse them and they just ask for more. My roomates often have to tap my shoulder cause they seal out noise pretty well. Would definitely recommend a set to anyone."
"Negative","DON'T EVEN BOTHER: THIS MOVIE IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO ADAMS FAMILY TV SHOW. NO STYLE JUSTA BUNCH OF KNOCK OFF FROM THE ORIGIN GREAT SHOW. UTTER BLAH."
"Positive","Elemental Desires: I loved the vairous stories. Each story using the elements in a whole new hot way. Each story is a page turner and so hot."
"Positive","It's all about the music!!!: What it boils down to is the music. And it is here that the movie version of the incredible stage play fails. Emmy Rossum is the one bright spot. She alone makes you glad you're listening. If they can dub Minnie Driver - why in the world did they not dub the two male leads. I *KNOW* that there have to be better singers' voices that could have been used. Josh Groban for instance.I will probably rewatch it in the future, but I will want to play the original cast recording as I mute the television. Otherwise, it was beautiful and wonderful to have another chance to *see* my favorite stage play, instead of only in my mind's eye."
"Negative","Bought at Macy's, broken within 4 months.: The drip coffee side completely died within 4 months of purchase. I now have to pay for shipping to their facility, shipping on a 14 pound package. It will be repaired and shipped back for free, but incredibly frustrating. I should've taken it back to Macy's to get my money back directly, but I waited too long. Avoid this brand and this machine at all costs. It looks nice on the box, but it's a plastic piece of crap. At the price I paid for it, I could've gone to a kitchen outlet store and bought a quality product made out of metal and built in the USA."
"Negative","delta seven weeks and still waiting: If I knew what I know now I would think twice about buying delta products. Longer warranty does not mean that they can obtain the needed parts for service . For example I turned in my dp350 to an authorized service center 12-30-2004 for defective drill speed adjuster guess what? they could not obtain the needed parts til today 2-19-2004. Can you go without a needed tool for that length of time? Other delta products I own ,portable 12.5"" planner and a 2 stage dust system. when I replace these items it will not be made by delta."
"Negative","clearly, not for me: Uses exoticism as a crutch: An anti-climactic and empty narrative. Plot, plot, plot, but no character development. I know the story of lord Buddha...what is the point of this movie!? Completely absurd. I truly *wanted* to like this movie, but it gave me no reason to.There ARE some adorable moments, and a well-directed and crafty depiction of one family in India. But these moments are few and far between, and they certainly don't save this movie. Rather one-sided and depends too much on the exoticism of Zen Budhism. Almost fetishistic. Unfortunate, becasue this concept had some potential."
"Positive","Works GREAT: It does what it's supposed to do! I bought it when I purchased the fryer. It woks great for saving the oil from the fryer."
"Positive","Good card holder: Pretty good. Compact and convenient to use. Leather seems to be of reasonable quality, and the design and stitching is good. It can hold well over 20 cards without getting distended or feeling uncomfortable in the pocket. Only one flip side, the card jackets are a little difficult to slide cards into and out of. Hence, it is easy to rip the jackets. Overall, a good buy."
"Negative","Messy, Messy, Messy!: I'm no stranger to waxing so I had no qualms about trying Nads for the first time. Never again! This stuff is extremely messy, and didn't work well. Did I mention how MESSY it is? I had this gel all over my bathroom counter. Yuck. Save your money. I recommend the Sally Hansen wax. You have to heat it in the microwave, but it's easy and very effective."
"Positive","The flunking of Joshua T. Bates: Dear viewers, I am rating this book five because it has humor and funny illustrations. Josh flunked 3rd grade. He was very upset. The day he got to school, every kid was smaller and the teacher was like a tank. I'm leaving it up to you. It is a high-level book! (...)"
"Negative","EMBARASSING!: Although I have not read the entire contents of this book I read enough for it to give me a pounding headache because it is indeed very painful to read. Who published this book? Jerry Springer Publishers.Being an exotic dancer myself and a very intellegent one at that I was embarassed that the stripper community has been so badly misrepresented by Ghetto Queen.This book is not only badly written, it is a big joke. This book has very little value. I would not even use it for a coaster.Barbee"
"Negative","Who in the holy heck thought of this game: My advice to you is to not get this game whatsoever. First of all they have these trivia questons that are from the most remote movies ever. Then before you can do ANYTHING you have to pick up other peoples trash (Which is just a dumb idea) Then when you do have the money from picking up trash you try to go on a ride and Woody the Woodpecker say ""This ride is full"" Then you have to go back to the front of the park (I wish you luck doing this)and use the points you got from shaking peoples hands and get a hat. (Another dumb idea) By the way when you try to get back to the ride (again i wish you luck) you cant find it. There is no map or signs of any sort. And the camera angles are horrible. This game is probably the worst game I've ever played in my whole life. I have Gamecube, XBOX, PS2, Dreamcast, N64, and Super Nintendo. And by far the easiest game. I will reapeat my self DO NOT GET THIS GAME UNLESS YOU LIKE BEING BORED. (And why is it rated T)"
"Positive","Amazon needs to sell the original version: The directors cut is very disappointing. The original with the voice over is better - it fits the piece better as does the music - and even the supposed happy ending is better because that happy ending is tempered by ford's character saying he didn't know how long they'd have together, but then again, who does..."
"Positive","Watch this twice: I watched this film for our film club, wasn't that interested. In seeing it, but so glad I did. Great cast, good film for group discussion."
"Negative","Handset will not charge: Have owned this phone for only 3 weeks and now the handset will not charge. It appears that the cordless cradle is not getting power for some reason (and yes, I tried other outlets in the house). What really irks me is that Motorola expects me to pay for shipping to send their defective phone back, AND they won't send me a replacement until they receive the defective one back. I thought these guys were a Six Sigma company? It really bothers me that a company sells you a defective product and on top of it, I get the inconvenience of having to re-package it, drive to the post office, and pay for shipping. Not impressed."
"Negative","its not a game its a controller..: only one of the controllers actually worked. to be more descriptive only one of the batteries can hold a charge so they sent me a faulty battery"
"Positive","Great Stanley tradition: Great album with only a couple of minor low points. Not bad for a 2 CD set. You more than get your moneys worth... Ralph could have had a couple more musicians instead of show casing his son so much, but he is up front about it at least.If you are a Stanleys fan you will like this album.."
"Negative","what the hell...: This is one of the worst movies ever made. The comedy can only be enjoyed by a preteen. An R-rated movie starring Bruce Willis with loney-toon style sound effects and all of the crappiest things you can think of. This movie is horrible. In order to like this movie you must have had a full lobotomy."
"Positive","more please.: the writers need to do a better job. that being said not bad. if i had to pay for this it would only get three stars i like the premise.but needs better job on the characters and i like the actors in this. need more lines for Debbie Reynolds.i don't think this made money but if it did we will get a part 2 or more of this character.i say see it for your self and decide.good viewing and good luck."
"Negative","Okay until washed!: The concept is great, but once the shirt is washed (& instructions were followed) it was ruined."
"Negative","Makes good coffee, NOT espresso: This makes a lousy espresso. There is no crema and it produces an average looking cup of coffee, except less volume. I would discourage anyone craving a great shot of creamy espresso from buying this. Spend the extra bucks for a pump or fully automated one."
"Negative","It's horrible camera: Hp is not the company for camera maker.I had to shut off and on the battery cover so many times to just turn camera on. I missed all the important moments. Simply, You cannot turn it on and off on time. Camera dock that came with it also not keep up the promise either. It won't charge battery as they promised. I bought a separate battery charger. $149 is very expensive for something that even cannot turn on. it is simply not responding. Don't waste your money on HP camera. Now I don't know what to with this piece of junk."
"Positive","Saved my vacation at the beach!: Worked better than I'd have believed. Probably too messy to serve as a total replacement for tampons - it'd be almost impossible to use/remove in a public restroom - but it was a perfect solution for an otherwise ruined week at the beach."
"Positive","Intense wordplay and sparse beats: This group seems to have released very little material, which is a shame, because they certainly had the talent for more. Densely packed verses and simple, snappy drum beats make this an album which lives up to its sci-fi namecheck. You get the feeling, as in the movie ""Alien,"" that you can't shake something that's just around the corner. Darkness preoccupies the writers as they spin tales of paranoia and tension. Is it really that kind of world, and if so, is it always going to be that way? Hear for yourself."
"Positive","Its time to make Injera !!!!: Works but doesn't come with a cover. I also have a ceramic/clay one I got from back home. I use it on my stove top. It is organic, HAHA... meaning no teflon in my injera. I use it all the time. This one is a back up when I get lazy. This is the 3rd one I have bought I wish they made this in iron/brass instead of coated teflon aluminum. But it works great and delivery was fast!"
"Negative","Purchase of a Leather Belt: The price of the belt was fine; the belt, however, was poorly madebecause the belt did not fit through the belt buckle easily. It isserviceable, but difficult to use."
"Negative","Not much depth and it won best picture?!?: The best thing abot this movie was Joseph Fiennes. Gwyneth Paltrow's performance wasn't worth anything, all she did was hop into bed with Fiennes and yell one liners. (Oscar should've gone to Cate Blanchett, but at lest she got the BAFTA) The best picture should have gone to (need I say it) Saving Private Ryan. I was disappointed by this movie. The Academy always tries to hate on Spielberg. But there were good parts, like Dench and Affleck. But the rest wasnothing but light fluff."
"Negative","Liked first two cds better: I ran across Kutless by accident, while surfing. I bought the first two cds and really enjoyed them. This is only my personal opinion, but this one was just too mellow for my taste. Its like the band was on tranquilizers. I realize it's just the style of the songs, but the first two cds really rocked compared to this one."
"Positive","Yum!: I've been looking for this books as it's part of a fabulous series of bread making cookbooks. It's a nice small format with easy to read font and a nice binding that opens flat."
"Positive","The Baudelaire Orphans Meditate On Good vs Evil: I think the biggest surprise of this penultimate book was the moral debate that's posed by the end of it. Who is good and who is evil becomes the conundrum that's processed through the wacky world of the Baudelaire orphans. Some small questions are definitely answered, but unfortunately, we'll all have to wait till the final book to see how it all shakes out. Can't say it was my favorite thus far, but I can say (and I never thought I'd say it in regards to these books) it absolutely made me think."
"Positive","Good movie!!!!: My husband and I have listened to Ghostface Killah's Ironman cd and we would always say ""man that sound like a good movie."" Finally,I decided to do an extensive search to find out what movie he got that excert from.When I found it I was ecstatic.I ordered it as an early xmas present for my husband.The movie was good,teaches about the perils of gang and hood life back in the 70's.It was really just great to finally see the movie that both Ghostface and Mobb Deep used excerts from in music and tie them together"
"Negative","what a horrible toy!: My son who is 6 years old was so exciting to get this toy for christmas, but it took my 18 year old son and myself FOREVER to put the blasted thing together and the slightest movement would knock it down. It was very unstable, had a million pieces and left my 6 year old frustrated. I will NEVER buy another imaginext toy ever again!!"
"Positive","Awesome Toddler Game: My almost 3 year old LOVES this game. The first time we played, we played 12 times in a row. She loves the ""dispenser"" that slides the tiles out and then making matches on her card. She usually does my card too, because she loves to play so much. This really helps with concentration, matching and word/picture relating.Would recommend for any toddler!!"
"Negative","Not that good: Bottom line is this is an album that should not have been released to the public yet. The recordings are also very bare which would be okay if this was ""Let it Be: Naked"" but it's not even close. So the songs which are already bad, suffer from simplistic intstrumentation. There isn't one song on here that's gonna grab you and hit you in the chest and make you say, ""I'm so glad I got this CD"". Look I love Ryan Adams and I'm a song-writer/singer myself and I think he's one of the best song-writers ever, but these songs are so forgettable. There is nothing to remember about it. So instead of this get Rock n Roll (if you like upbeat rock), Gold (if you like a mix of everything), or Heartbreaker (if you wanna feel what being sad is like through music and lyrics.)"
"Negative","Not in step with today's market.: It is my opinion that this book presents an overly optimistic view of contract technical writing. First of all, contract tech writing is limited to certain geographic areas. If you live in a nice, quiet little burg, you will have a hard time locating work. In other words, be prepared to move to the big city to find work. Telecommuting is not a reality for most of us. Maybe in the future, but not now! Second of all, everyone and their uncle is trying to get into the profession. Kent fails to mention that a technical ""knowledge base"" is necessary in order to convince those who have the power to hire you. Just having an English degree won't get you in the door. Thirdly, much of the material is just a rehash from the earlier edition.Buy the book if you must, but keep your reality reading glasses close at hand.Roger Peterson"
"Positive","Kidde KN-COSM-B Battery-Operated combination Carbon Monoxide and Smoke detector: We are very please with this item. It seems to be working well and we are grateful for the protection it gives. Thank you."
"Positive","SAW THEM IN CONCERT: I saw JCS live at the EDGE b-day bash and they kicked ass they played the one chord song but my favorite was high because Jimi HAHA is a freakin idot jumpin around saying,,,, HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
"Positive","My Favorite: I love this video and show it to my 13 month old, who gets a pretty good kick out of it too. The reasons that other folks have listed are the same reasons I love it. But ""Put Down the Duckie"" is one of the best songs I've seen in a long time!"
"Negative","Boring.: What happened with this book? From the 1st book till the 9th it was really good but here there's rarely any action at all. I was expecting better from this series."
"Positive","This book is very insightful and helpful.: I have taught this book in adult Sudnay School with excellent results. The book is structured in a way that makes teaching easy! I recommend it highly!"
"Negative","lasts about 3 years: I've had my SM-70 about 3 years now and the motor has burned out and the housing is also falling apart. I use it almost daily, baking all of the bread, pizza, bagels, etc. for a family of 4. It has lasted a little longer than the last 2 KitchenAids I owned, but not much. I think you get what you pay for and this is still a very inexpensive mixer compared to an Electrolux or a commercial brand like Hobart."
"Positive","AWESOME!: DELICIOUS! This is a rock & roll tour of the raunchiest bachelor parties ever. Right off the bat a sweet motion menu pops up and lets you decide what party to visit first, but it really doesn't matter because they all rock. Every party has 2 chicks performing, dudes getting drunk, and having a blast. I got totally turned on by the whip cream show. A must see. I never laughed so hard at guys going gonzo at bachelor parties. One bachelor is walked around like a dog and spanked. Another dude goes crazy and puts on the strippers clothes and dances for them. a lot wildness and nudity in this bad boy. I wish I had a camera when the wives see this one."
"Positive","Life changing, a MUST read: This is the best book I've read on raising leaders. If you've identified your calling as a leader, drop all other books, read this book and discover life transforming truths."
"Positive","The book is great: but the shipping sucked!!!The delivery time was great.However, you guys sent it to the billing address... not the delivery address. So I was late on an assignment for class."
"Positive","It's Great!: This is really a great CD. Chumbawamba has many political and social thoughts. you just have to understand them."
"Negative","Lacklustre: In a book aiming to thresh out the dynamics of gender, Lorber's text seems to demonstrate that she doesn't have exactly the firm grip of the subject that the title suggests she has. While the other chapters which deal with more feminist issues with relation to gender are a bit more sound and solid, and the preceding chapters dealing with the 'nuts and bolts' of gender are somewhat vaguely fresh and readable (although not really saying much new), it is worrisome to see that while Lorber tries her hardest to remain objective, her dated and misunderstood views on transgender (she does not use this already popular term) issues betray her objectivity. All in all, her little inconsistencies and sometimes erroneous reasoning to gender, especially with regard to gender identity, do really show that she might have missed the boat with this one."
"Negative","Don't Hold Your Breath On This One ...: Adele Morales (who insists on keeping her famous ex husband's name- she is one of several wives) took the plunge into exploiting her husband's name and tremendous literary reputation with the apparent hope/expectation that by revealing the details of their marital years, she would also profit. She has no journalistic saavy, apparently limited intelligence as she fails to deliver the gory scoop that the jacket promises. Instead she indulges in extolling her own deluded and narcissistic virtues (as she perceives them) and guys, it's tiresome. Her way of putting words together and general idea conveyance leaves much to be desired, which strikes me with wry irony because the level of Norman Mailer's genius renders his taste in this woman laughable. Sadly, at the climax of her ""epic torture"" I found myself commiserating with her husband- after all, he had to put up with her for too long."
"Negative","Does nothing: This is the worst food processor we have owned. Leaves lumps of fruit or veggies, even after extended processing.Very noisy"
"Positive","A Jewel Among Female Writers: I am disgusted at my bachelor degree because of the oversight of a writer like Edna Ferber. My only knowledge of her had been the movies made from her work, i.e., Giant and Showboat. When I read her, I was totally amazed that she was not required reading in college lit courses, rather than the usual ""romance"" writers like Austen.The humor, the breadth of characterization, the essential sympathy of human male and female psychology makes her one of the best writers I have ever read. I intend to read all of her works!"
"Positive","Best Trading Book: The book is very well written and covers material that is important to new and/or experienced traders. The information I've learned by far exceeds the price of the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who contemplates trading."
"Positive","I love this router!: 2HP is tons of power for a router, but this one still starts up smooth with the electronic ""soft start"" circuitry. The variable speed control is a great feature too. Amazingly accurate depth adjustment. The wooden handles are a touch of class. Oh yeah, it's also lightweight and very quiet.I suggest buying the combination set that comes with both the fixed base (like this one) and the plunge base. That deal is too good to pass up."
"Negative","Plastic - Not solid wood: This product is not solid wood. Very cheap looking. Extremely poor quality case."
"Positive","Funny Tragedy: I can't believe he made such a funny book about a heartbreaking subject. I am in shock that this even happened. If only I could have one more book from him. However, it is too damn late. I can not believe I am wanting to cry and laugh at the same time."
"Positive","Prime member - speedy delivery: I ordered a DVD at Amazon.com and received the item 2 days after my order. No delivery charge and no sales tax. Can't beat it! I love Amazon.com being a prime member (free 2 days delivery). Never fail! I stop going to the store now since it is easier and faster at Amazon."
"Negative","ZERO STARS please!: I'm sorry to say, but this is one of the worst CD's I have to date: ZERO stars! . Bad lyrics, badly sung. I think Jewel is - like Britney Spears - a childish probably tone deaf teen. Music for the brain dead and non-critics. Produced by scrupulus child exploiters and non-musical editors. That goes to say that luckily for Jewel these kind of people do exist. Today everything sells, if pushed hard enough by marketing or dj-pluggers. Sorry Jewel... I gave your Cd to the salvation army. (it was an gift anyway)"
"Positive","Classic pre-Parrothead JB: I went to high school in South Florida in the late 70's and JB is the soundtrack from that part of my life. My love of the ocean, Caribbean and sailing is all tied up in this music. I owned this album on vinyl and it is still one of my favorites. I haven't seen a JB concert in some years but this captures the concerts I used to attend in Ft. Lauderdale with my buddies. I agree with the other reviews that say this is his best live recording. It is very intimate and although I own the studio versions of all these songs I prefer the live versions of ""Wonder Why We Ever Go Home"", ""Tampico Trauma"" and ""Grapefruit, Juicy-Fruit"". The cultural references like the ""Holiday Inn full of Coneheads"" take me back to long summers and the ""Yankee Clipper"" beach..."
"Negative","I don't get it....: Occasionally enjoy reading a ""classic"" , but just could not get into this one. Seriously, in the course of just 4 pages, 3 friends get drunk, enlist for the war, come home, the main character acts like a fool, gets thrown in jail, escapes, meets an old friend, roasts a pig in the woods, gets drunk again.....all in just the first couple of pages!! And really, early 20th century ""Paisoanos"" speaking like ""What thoust does one do with thine wine""...Really?? Somewhat reminds me of some stories I've read by Voltaire, ridiculous and fast moving, however Voltaire's being much more meaningful and philosophical. Sorry, I gave up on this one by the first chapter (something i almost NEVER do!)"
"Negative","Do Not Read This Book: ... unless you really want to. And you better have good reasons in that case. I can't imagine what they could be though. If you want to ponder, circa 1988, the problems facing U.S. cities, or terrorism, or conspiracy, you'll not find anything much here. This is Franzen's first book, written 13 years before the materpice The Corrections (which is why you're considering this one, right?), and the kid had not yet assembled his talents nor adequately honed his intelligence. Rather than itemize its marginal successes against it's tedious failures, I'm gonna streamline for you: the only reason to give this a workout is to see how much the author, as a storyteller, truthteller, character-meister, has developed since. And that endevour is one of research. Read The Corrections again instead. Seriously."
"Positive","Best Hemorrhoid Cure Ever: I have tried the other creams like Preparation H. They have not worked like they say and are even messier than this ointment. You get quick, very good relief and the hemorrhoids do go away in a short while (less than a week). This absolutely works and well worth your purchase. Very reasonable price - in my opinion."
"Positive","Internet predator on the lose: This is my review on Katie.com by Katherine Tarbox. 13-year-old Katherine Tarbox meets 23-year-old Mark on the internet. Katie thinks that Mark is an excellent swimmer, good student in school, good-looking, etc. But one night mark called Katie and convinces her that he should go to her swim meet.I really liked this book. It taught me about all the dangers that we have on the internet. So if you ever meet somebody you don't know on the internet just use one of your BLOCK icons and he or she can't bug you any more. I think kids who are 12 and older should read this bookThank you for reading my review. I hoped you enjoyed it. So read this book today. I gave this book 4 stars ****."
"Negative","Nice idea poorly executed: The idea of this blanket is great; however, like another person said, it does not swaddle the baby nearly tight enough- my son would have his arms and legs out in less than a minute. He is a big baby but the newborn size was too large. We waited, hoping that when he grew, it would work better. Now he is over 12lbs and the tabs still go way past where they are supossed to attach, and he's outgrown the length. Save your money and buy some waffle weave blankets- they stretch and work much better- I was even able to swaddle my 9m old son in them {I had to swaddle him for a long time}."
"Positive","No doubt this album is very high quality: Each song in this album is all great. Not even one song is bad. This is the highest quality album I've ever listened to. Billy Corgan is so creative. He showed in this album all the kind of things he can do. What this album is missing is songs doesn't support each other as one. There are loud rock music and soft ballard, and fast pop music all in one cd! In Adore, Billy Corgan did it right, but not as high quality as this album. I give 5 stars because what he did is unbelievable, despite of all I've said."
"Negative","Wouldn't have purchased if I'd seen them first: I bought these albums because they looked very similar to albums I already had (but were no longer in stock at a local store and I couldn't find them online). The plastic on each of the pages in these albums is all wrinkled instead of smooth like in our other albums. Also, once you have put 300 pictures in the album, the cover would not lay flat anymore like our others. Unfortunately I even bought 2 of these. I definitely would not buy them again. For the price, I expected them to be better quality."
"Positive","Vampire Punk Rockers From Hell: Track Number 8: Vampire Punck Rockers From Hell is simply awesome! It alone makes this CD worthwhile."
"Negative","Worst movie ever: ""Heaven"" is the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't understand why people are giving this movie such high ratings. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie."
"Positive","A story about four girls who change their whole lives.: A brilliant book of true lives. Of great hopes and tragedies. A story someone has to read till the end."
"Positive","really fun!: i could not put this book down! And after reading it, i had to get the sequel (Dance Dance Dance) right away. this is a detective novel of the psyche that is surreal, wild and superbly absurd!"
"Positive","Tom Hanks at his best, but not without a few flaws.: Loved the movie. Loved Tom Hanks in the main role. Catherine Zeta-Jones was outstanding. Was it better than Forrest Gump, Private Ryan, or Philadelphia? No, absolutely not. I thought it was a terrfic and entertaining movie and Tom Hanks was fantastic playing an immigrant from a foreign country that no longer existed for him, but he's done much better work in much better movies, yet, I can't fault him on this one because he was funny, intriguing and very cool in the role. I thought he did a great job, the accent must have been tough for him, but he was good. Just damned good. The great supporting cast certainly helped, but if I were asked to recommend this movie to someone, I certainly would. If nothing else, it's entertaining and Tom did a pretty good job. And overall, it was an interesting story."
"Negative","Quite possibly....: ...the worst album I have ever heard in my entire life.I was a great fan of Michael Ball's when his career was focused on the musical stage, but his move (and subsequent albums) to the pop arena left me cold. As well as being a fan of musical theater, I also adore country music. So, when I found out that Michael Ball had made a ""country"" album, my curiosity was piqued.First of all, this is not country music. These are covers of songs originally recorded by country artists. This CD would not be considered country in Nashville, Minneapolis, Branson or even Vegas. The last, however, seems the most likely home for this CD. Gone is the simple and clear emotional renderings of the original artists. Instead, the sorry souls listening are subjected to over-orchestrated arrangements created, to my best guess, to hide the fact that Mr. Ball's once incredible range has all but disappeared and years of smoking and vocal misuse have wreaked havoc on his vocal chords."
"Negative","another mediocre female artist?: true artists are born with a gift; they don't make mistakes. in the final show this girl was noticeably out of pitch at least once in every song. does anyone really think that this girl can out-write, out-perform, or even [nearly] equal the offerings of natural female talents such as shania twain or faith hill? of course not. so, what is the point?"
"Negative","JUST BUY THE FIRST SEASON: This DVD is just the first 8 episodes of the first season - not really ""Farm Favorites"". I enjoyed them - but wish I had just paid a small amount more and bought the entire first season. The pig, Arnold, wasn't even in these episodes!"
"Positive","insane absurd and sad at the same time: i have now read pulp twice. the first time i didn't care for it too much. It was cheesy, proposed that celine was alive with any supernatural explanation, had space aliens and the lady death. I dumbed down my brain so hard that I didn't see the point. but the second time through, i really enjoyed it. it's a nice quick read that you don't have to concentrate to hard to get."
"Positive","A great dvd boxset for my collection: I was so happy to purchase this dvd boxset, i love it when i a cartoon is released as a boxset instead of a few episodes on 1 disc. This is one of the greastest cartoons ever to be made and i am grateful for its release. If you are a hardcore GI JOE fan as i am, then you will want this boxset in your collection."
"Negative","broke, no support: Initially I loved it, exactly what I wanted. But it quit working within a month. Then I found out the product was discontinued in 2008, so there is no support available for it."
"Negative","Should have listened to the other reviews...: The suction on these bowls does not work on high chair trays. If you're looking for something to keep your little one from dumping the bowl on the floor, save your money; this is not what you want. They do work better than a regular bowl, when we're working on using a spoon or fork."
"Negative","My Least Favorite of the Series: When I finally was able to find a copy of this final installment of the series, I was so excited to read it. I re-read the first three to refresh my memory with the comings and goings of our friends Chole and Cheftu. Imagine my disappointment to have to say how much I hated this book. There was almost no interaction between Chole and Cheftu, no clear explanation of how we got there or where we are going, and a really dumb story line. Ms. Frank also forgot to continue with some outstanding issues from the prior novels....like with the character Dion and a certain elixir? The only reason why I read the whole thing was to see how Ms. Frank was going to end her series. Since I'm not the kind of person who would post spoilers, let me just sum up by saying this: Big Disappointment."
"Positive","Great Book!: This is one of those books that I ended up staying up late for. You'll find yourself laughing, on the verge of a tear, and rooting for JD and Noah right to the end. This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. The only downside was that the whole jars-in-the-walls aspect was never very interesting to me and turned out to not really mean much. An effort was made to loosely tie it all together, but that whole angle could've easily been left out or at least better developed."
"Positive","Great Buy: Great Price and nothing beats a romance movie! Not great acting or filming but nothing like cheesy romance to bring a smile to your face and help you relax"
"Negative","No subtitles: This story/video may be brilliant: we will never know. No subtitles. Why, oh why?I would always buy La Plante, but without subtitles, the British are impossible to understand. What a disappointment.At least now I am savvy enough to check out whether subtitles on Netlix. No subtitles: no purchase."
"Positive","I am Proud of this product: It is a beautiful cd. And when You read the liner notes you will see what it is all about and appreciate this more. Her voice is unique and when you hear it you will agree."
"Positive","Great Bass for an Immersing feel: These headphones have a lot of base. This makes the music seem louder than it is and it is a lot fuller and more immersing. They don't have an active noise canceling system but do a good job passively.The sound quality on these if you like bass is the best you can get for your money. If you're not a bass fan there are some better options out there. That being said the base does make the music sound better (i think) in genres other than Rap. At the $30 price I got these for I would recommend buying them even if your not a bass fan. They are comfortable and feel like a well made product. An enormous step up from my ipod brand earbuds."
"Positive","sad :(: I absolutely adore this movie. But it saddens me that still noone has put it onto dvd. I figured for sure by now it would be on dvd. maybe someday!"
"Positive","USB 250MB Zip Drive: Mine went bad over a year ago & I wanted to start using one again for certain things @ home & finally got around to it several weeks ago & ordered a pre owned unit. Got it, + 3 discs, USB cord & desk base. I have sooo many 100MB & 250 MB discs it is nuts. Used Zip drives at my sign shop for awhile. I have bags & bags of discs. Anyway, the unit is working fine. May have to use half my discs for target practice."
"Positive","Image Isn't Everything, but Apparently It's Pretty Damn Close: If ol' Mike Score could have only ditched the seagull haircut and re-invented the look of the group, this band might have maintained the status which acts like the Police and U2 and Bowie have managed to maintain, and their claim to fame with younger people wouldn't be that Adam Sandler movie. Only, they wouldn't have been the Flock then, would they?Check out ""I Ran"" but also ""Nightmares"", ""Wishing"", and ""Space Age Love Song."" In my book, the Flock is a prime example of what can happen when you mix genius artistry with an inability to reinvent itself. But then again, that implies that an artist needs to sacrifice his or her integrity in their art to alter themeselves and land public success. Hm.Either way, look forward to another project guys."
"Positive","Necessary if you are going in to a medical field: This was suggested to me by an A&P teacher, as a necessity of anyone going to Nursing school, or anyone in the medical field. Older version are cheaper, but have same content so don't bother getting a new more expensive version."
"Positive","a hard drive for your PDA: this hard drive works right away on my Dell X50v and HP HX2415shows 7.45GB on today screenwrite/read speed is OKAY, a little bit slower than Kingston Elite Pro 4GB CFit also works on my card reader (hotway HRA-U212)it don't generate much heat when it's busy, just a little bit warm when it's busy (transferring GBs of audio files once)on my HX2415, battery time cuts short a bit (about 5-6 hours of audio play with GSPlayer; while I can get 8-9 hours with Kingston)suggestion: put a scotch tape to make a tab to help pulling out with PDAconclusion: if you have to carry HUGE amount of audio/video files to play with your pda, and you have couple more extra batteries, this PDA hard drive is an excellent choice for the price"
"Negative","Only lasted one season: This product performed adequately for one season. When we attempted to use it at the beginning of the second season, we discovered the motor unit was no longer working. In view of the price of the unit, it should have a useful life in excess of six months."
"Positive","Very Nice Slipper: I ordered these slippers for my husband for Christmas this year. He asked for one thing and that was a nice pair of indoor/outdoor slippers. When they arrived, I opened the box and was very pleased. My husband is pretty picky and he really, really likes them. He said they are made very well, they are very warm, and made to last. I would definitely recommend them!"
"Positive","A delicious selection of Gorey delights: A collection of various works by the devilishly deadpan Gorey, ""Amphigorey Also"" is a book that demands repeated readings. The book displays Gorey's talents to the fullest, from his painstakingly cross-hatched black-and-white drawings to his more lighthearted color works. This book is a must-read (and a must-own) for Gorey fans as well as the uninitiated."
"Positive","Delta Javelina target. Affordable!: This is the lowest price you can find for this target on line or anywhere else.Shipping was fast and I have to say Iwas surprised when saw the price, most 3d targets are really expensive but this seller has the best prices in the market, I recommend you check out store for great savings. I gave it four stars only because the product has some imperfections, like if it didn't pass Q.A. process, for example it has a big foam bump by front leg and a hole by mouth, other than that product is good condition. None of this matter to me, it's going to get shot anyways! Hope this helps. Thank you."
"Positive","it sucks - that's a good thing: Good power for a cordless handheld. Somewhat heavier than I expected, but we usually use it for quick clean-ups around the kitchen, so its weight is not much of a problem. Not as cool looking as the Dyson Rocket, but the Dyson costs way more."
"Negative","A rather poor effort: An interesting plot and thought-provoking premise is subverted by very poor, cliche-ridden writing. Richard Dreyfuss should stick to acting, and Turtledove should stick to winning Hugos."
"Negative","2.5 stars!: Night Crossing follows a woman who finds herself in the middle of a terrorist attack in Ireland. The story is fairly interesting, but the writing in my opinion is not that great. The story line sounds interesting, but the way Snyder writes seems to cut down on the action. I would not really recommend this book."
"Positive","greatest funniest game ever: great graphics great for partys and everything i would get this game at a differnt store like circuit city but its a sweet game"
"Positive","Another good performance: I have all of the Celtic Woman dvds up to this date. This one is very entertaining, but my favorite dvd is ""A New Journey"". Video resolution is not quite as sharp as before, but still great to watch. A definite buy for any fan of this talented group."
"Positive","Good memories: I have the nostalgia of the 80's, people had a good time with all those love songs. I was only 14 but I remember dancing on those songs with my big brothers and my uncle, hearing them in parties...I miss all those simple and innocent times. We just had fun altogether went back home. I've been singing for.. a while and I started by listening and imitating Keith Sweat, Aliyaah, Toshi Kubota, 112, brandi, etc...But my first love is still for Keith Sweat and Al B. Sure..."
"Positive","GREEN DAY IS THE BEST BAND AROUND BY FAR: Dookie is by far, the best Green Day C.D. out. It took me awhile to come to that being the biggest Green Day fan around. It has energy. It is punk. There are the best punk songs on here that I have listened to yet. It is a C.D. that you can listen to forever without getting tired of it (but that's with all Green Day music)."
"Negative","A change... probably not for the better: So, for better for worse, Incubus took a huge step backwards with this album. From S.C.I.E.N.C.E. to Make Yourself to Morning View, they slowly progressed to tighter more produced music, losing some of their heaviness in the process. Apparently, somebody decided that this needed to be changed. Someone also apparently locked the produced in the closet, as this entire album sounds like it was recorded in a basement. The songs are much heavier that the previous 2 albums, so if you were a big S.C.I.E.N.C.E fan, you might enjoy that, but it feels like much of the artistry is gone, and all attempt at any backup vocals/harmonies seems to have gone out the window."
"Negative","Short life span: Worked great. For a whole 6 months - then it died. Must have gotten a lemon. I could return it, but between the postage expense and the required fee to the company, it just isn't worth it."
"Negative","Anything for money!: It is so sad what people will do for money. Lying, sensationalizing, disrespecting and profitting off another under those reasons is simply wrong. But then again, many people have been doing that to Michael Jackson for years. It's little wonder he hurt. Don't buy this book and allow these kinds of people to treat their fellow man in this way."
"Negative","Hurtful with lack of hope for a spouse suffering celibacy: I,m sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this book was very hurtful to me in the darkest days of my marriage. The chapter on sex says in effect, the abused spouse needs to taking a ""healing vacation"" from sex, it then goes on to tell the non-abused spouse: you'll learn to live without, apparently forever. There was no assurance it would ever get better. Fortunately my marriage did get better, but this book didn't. The authors mean well and have much good to offer, but if you've been a married monk for 12 months, you don't want to hear it."
"Negative","Not for non-psychology majors: This book is only for those who already have a strong background in biology and psychology. However, if you are new to the subject, then this book is not for you. Students who are taking this subject as an elective will have a hard time with the research style presentation of topics. I'd much rather buy a book that explains topics as clear and concise as possible rather than have a play on words."
"Negative","This Movie Was Weird!: Being a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis and really liking her first horror movie Halloween and liking Stacy Keach from his Mike Hammer TV show I watched Road Games and I did not like the movie, it was weird, the plot was, well there wasn't much of a plot and it wasted the talents of both Jamie Lee Curtis and Stacy Keach. It was definitely one of the worst movies I have ever watched!"
"Positive","Good looking & easy to move: Griffin was kind enough to send this as a thank-you for testing software for their powermate product. I had never considered purchasing a laptop stand; it works nicely supporting my MacBook Air next to my HP 23 inch monitor. Only negative: wish the legs would clip into or through the acrylic crossbar. Nonetheless if I were to lose this one I would immediately purchase a replacement unit."
"Positive","You can teach an old dog new 'treats': this is not my first purchase of this item. I am especially pleased that my dog likes these, as she is very picky. Good to find something helpful for her joints, that she enjoys eating.Nutri-Vet Hip & Joint Lamb & Rice Flavor Wafers for Dogs - Medium Biscuit - 19.5oz"
"Negative","neat n dry: I do not like this product, it is too small and not absorbant like it says, do not waste your money"
"Positive","Fabulous and luminous!: This is my first Gilberto Gil album, so I'm not familiar with his other recordings and cannot make comparisons. I can only say that I found this recording to be totally enchanting and when I listen I feel happy, de-stressed, profoundly moved, and in awe of this masterful performer. Not crazy about the cover, but don't judge the book by its cover!"
"Negative","personal, not systematic exegesis: Pagels' book is an almost-too-good representation of syncretist gnostic thought. The fact is, though, to understand the Idea or Essence in any system of thought, we must go to the doctors or epitomes of that creed. The proper study of this dualism, and its relation (anti-relation) to Christianity is to be found in, e.g., Manichaeism, Buddhism, Catharism. Dried-up popular and superficial creeds don't have the life in them that these more excellent (and demanding faiths) do. The proof is plain; each of these aforementioned movements has its Saints. Where, I might (unfairly) ask, are the martyrs, the living perfections of the New Age movement? One actually has to stifle his laughter; it (Gnosticism) will fade again, and return again; no matter. Pagels is no saint."
"Positive","Beloved curmudgeon's distinguished past revealed: Best known to us anglophiles as Victor Muldrew on BBC's ""One Foot in the Grave,"" Richard Wilson's true past as a distinguished director in the English theatre is revealed by author Roose-Evans. Unlike American celebs who seem to have every detail of their personal life on display, this UK treasure has managed to live his life in dignfied privacy while creating hallmarks of creative stage productions admired and respected by the British theatre community. Roose-Evans reveals details of Mr. Wilson's life in a respectful yet most fascinating way providing us with a better understanding of Wilson's most famous comedic character. We can only hope for another volume to catch us up after the end of ""One Foot in the Grave."""
"Negative","Risks Using Quicken: Before you give Quicken such a favorable review, you might want to check the 4 month problem they have had with Credit Card downloads. These have compromised the integrity of customer financial records. Their final solution has been to have customers manually check 4 months of statements and enter missing transactions by hand.In the course of this problem they gave out incorrect information stating how soon the problem would be fixed, and stating that when fixed one would be able to download the missing transactions. For months they did not even inform customers that the problem continued past the original June 24 deadline.Howard Sloane"
"Negative","SIGNATURE OF GOD: NOT WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE. TOO MUCH SENSATIONALISM AND NOT ENOUGH FACT. I DON'T TRUST HIM."
"Positive","Nice coffee maker: This is a great machine. Replace an old leaky Mr. Coffee. Not fancy but FAST and brews a nice fresh, HOT cup of coffee."
"Positive","Best coffee machine for the price: I bought this machine for my office. Small size and fits in a corner. Makes great coffee, you just have to play with the proportions. Replaced the original coffee filter with paper filters (Melitte #1 coffee filter) - saves me the trouble of washing the filter every time. I am now known as the coffee guy at work - as everyone around me can smell Java that is brewed in this baby. I am glad I bought this machine."
"Positive","plays well: i would have given this 5 stars but the volume doesnt go down far enough to use as sleeping music. also there is a noticable hum in the background. it sounds much better than the other xm boomboxes i tried especially at louder volumes."
"Positive","Toshiba PA3457U-1BRS performs well as expected: This battery from Toshiba performs just as advertized. I had tried a model from a different manufacturer, and that did not perform at all. Not only was the up time time shorter, the battery almost never got fully charged, except when it came brand new. I am happy I was able to return that and bought this one from Amazon at a great price."
"Negative","Terrible for younger listners: This album stinks. She is trying to be like Madonna. She will never be around long enough to outsell Mariah the real singer"
"Negative","Adequate: Read The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle instead. Murakami's latest novel is certainly readable, in the sense that a very cheap wine is ""drinkable"", but it is also bottomlessly self-indulgent. Murakami writes very well, but he is not writing about much of anything in Kafka on the Shore. Empty and dull."
"Negative","This software should be free !: And even then I wouldn't recommend it. I found this software simple and unhelpful. There is no great organization capability and the program seems to waste a lot of disk space needlessly. I origianlly worked with Sonicstage (Sony) which I thought was great. Unfortunately Sonicstage copyright protects everything and it is therefore impossible to transfer music from one computer to the next. I bought mp3maker to solve this problem. It turned out to be a great irritation."
"Negative","Tomolino 14 oz. Vacuum Amphi Mug: I was so not pleased with this product. I had purchased a $5 mug from Wal Mart and thought this was slimilar. My cheap mug keeps my coffee hot for hours...this mug, which costs more, doesn't keep your drink warm for even 30 minutes! Even after setting the cup in scalding hot water prior to filling with your drink. What a waste of money!"
"Positive","This is worth reading: I would also recommend the many other books that have been translated by Lucien Stryk. The best translator of Zen poetry. This book is something I sought out and purchased when it was rare, and I wouldn't be without it. It is a gem. If you collect Zen poetry, buy this.Look into the historical roots of Zen poetry, in China, then go back to Tao and Confucianism.Neither here nor...pbc"
"Positive","She is great!: Ashlee simpson has to proved to be a very good singer/songwriter. I actually had no idea she was jessicas little sister untill i saw her show, you wouldnt really guess. This single is very catchy and has great lyrics, which by the way were written by ashlee herself. Bottom line this is a very strong ffirst single and hopefully she follows on this track."
"Positive","great resource!: I *highly* recommend Bauer's history books for homeschoolers or any parent wanting to give their young children a good introduction to history. Bauer has struck a perfect balance between making history comprehensible and interesting to a young mind, without being boring or ""cutsie."" She also manages to deal with the gore and unpleasantries of history as lightly as possible without ignoring them. I am thrilled with this series, and had sought long and hard for a single-series history resource for homeschooling my children-- I did not want to take a literature approach where you read dozens of different books. I also wanted a course that was more or less secular. While Bauer's books are certainly in the ""western tradition,"" they are not explicitly religious per se. The only warning I would give is that your child at least has to be at a late 2nd grade/ early 3rd grade level (regardless of age) to be able to absorb the information."
"Positive","Super Mem Book: This book is awesome so far, but I haven't been able to read it all because I am a student and am currently in college. It really does work and I have only read the first couple of chapters. It will stick with you if you really do what he says"
"Negative","Disappointing: I expected a great great read, and that's the way the book begins. The momentum soon bogs down into a mediocre TV series. Dog-lovers need beware of a particular scene that is simply unnecessary and cruel.I would suggest ""Witnessing America"" (nonfiction) or ""Time and Again"" for excellent historical story-telling."
"Negative","Not Helpful: I re-read sections of this book on cash flow analysis and found it much less useful than 5 years ago when I read the first edition. The market does not care anymore about smaller high free cash flow and low debt companies."
"Negative","Terrible: An experiment:1. Listen to ""Splendor Solis"", ""Edges of Twilight"", ""Alhambra"", and ""Transmission"".2. Next, listen to ""Triptych"", ""Interzone Mantras"", and ""Seven Circles"".3. Which group of albums churns your stomach raw???Something between Transmission and Triptych occurred that radically altered the Tea Party's musical vision, but I can't begin to imagine. Nonetheless, The Tea Party is no longer a band I musically respect. ""The Seven Circles"" embodies a form of music that I find repugnant. The party is indeed over.This album is TERRIBLE."
"Positive","Fun movie: I love to watch this movie around Christmas. While not technically a ""Christmas Movie"" it does take place during the holiday season. The robbers are a little too over the top for my adult taste but after all the movie is targeted to kids so I can over look that."
"Negative","Real Yaz(oo) fan's won't need this one.....: This ""best of"", along with the Naked Eyes ""best of"" ( both try to condense two albums into one best of ) should not please any true Yaz fan. If you are a fan of analogue 80's Synthpop then you must own BOTH Yaz albums and the masterful Naked Eyes, self titled as well. Buy the full albums and you won't have to wonder what you missed! You'll make you and me both happy people! :-) Bernie"
"Positive","Can't beat this mod collection: Great 60's lesser known singles. Yes, you get early Kinks, David Bowie, Sorrows, Bystanders, and The Clique, but many of the lesser known groups steal the thunder. With 30 songs, you're bound to find at least half to your liking. When it comes to compilation cd's, it seems like many of the mod comps are among the most consistent. A worthy purchase."
"Negative","Why did they call this an Ozric release?: No Joie, no Jumping John, no Zia, no Rad, no Schoo, no Seaweed, no bass on most of the songs (unless you count synth bass as bass), more like half a Nodens Ictus project. When Ed married Brandi 'Yoko Ono' Wynne, she proceeded to sack every remaining member of the band that had talent,and this is the sad result. When Ozrics were in their prime back in the eighties and nineties, they would perform mind-bending psychedelic excursions with incredibly clever song titles. On this CD, the song titles are just ridiculous. Avoid. Get everything previous first."
"Positive","Life changing cd: All I can say is thanks to spike, the wind, the taxman, the 1605's, and anyone associated with this cd it changed my life still listen to it daily. Its a real shock to the music system and to your thought process on many diffrent topics from god to governement its all adressed. Thanks again Corporate Avenger hate to see what I would be if I never heard this album. Also If you can find it check out the video they did it was also very good."
"Positive","Casio 3-Pack Black Ribbon Cartridges: The Casio Title Printer ink ribbons are easy to install and replace. It is suggested that the any slack in the ribbon is taken out when installing a replacement cartridge. The only criticism I have is that you have to replace the cartridges frequently and they are expensive. The titles and images transferred to disc are excellent quality and permanent. If it wasn't for the cost, I would have rated this product 5 stars."
"Positive","brilliant beautiful genius: this album had me crying and still does sometimes. but again like miseducation those interludes get on my damn nerves. can we just listen to some songs on your next album lauryn without havin to take our walkmans out to fastforward or skip the interludes?"
"Positive","W O W: Kudos and ditto to what everyone else has already said. I only want to add one more thing. Recently purchased a blender from this site that ""passed away"" after only TWO uses :o( . We have since used this b&d chopper as a BLENDER--daily making green smoothies {kale, chard, baby spinach, celery, romaine lettuce, banana, & water...yum} and it is just as good as any blender out there--just use the high setting for a few minutes and you will be pleasantly surprised. It will remain on the countertop as a food processor AND blender. Thank you-"
"Positive","Title says it all!: It's an easy to use book with great recipes, exercises, hints & helps for lifestyle improvement! I have given several to friends & family who have really gotten motivated! It's a book I recommend!"
"Negative","Absurdly OVER PRICED!!!!!!!!!: This book is extremely over-priced for what it is. It's like a long pamphlet with info-bites, rather than a book. For $25 I would have expected a tome...or even a mini-tome, but this is the size and length of a 4th graders novel...likely less. It measures 8-1/2"" x 5-1/2"", and the pages - before you get to the appendix, number only 126. As I breezed through it I found nothing new that I could not find by simply doing a keyword search on line. I'm returning it, since I can search the net for free. Ridiculously over-priced, and if you're not annoyed by doing a bit of online research, your time will be way better spent doing that, than ordering this over-priced book."
"Negative","Good marketing, bad book: The ""rave"" reviews here sound like industry blurbs, and there isn't anything really new worth your money. My mom gave it to me, and I'm going to keep it only to recycle as a ""duty"" gift this Christmas. And in case no one else has pointed it out, ""simply grande"" is an oxymoron."
"Negative","JONNY SHOULD HAVE STUCK TO WHAT WORKED FOR HIM!: IF YOUR LOOKING FOR THE SAME SOUND AS THE LIE TO ME CD ( HARD ROCKIN BLUES ) IT AINT HERE MAN. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A COUPLE OF NOTABLE TRACKS THIS IS NOT THE JONNY LANG YOU WOULD BE EXPECTING. THERE IS TOO MUCH FUNK HERE TO BE BLUES AND FOR THE MOST PART, THIS WILL NOT APPEAL TO AN OLD ROCK BLUES FAN. IE: STONES / CCR SKIP THIS ONE AND WAIT JONNY WILL RETURN TO US."
"Positive","""Pop Trash""....worthy or not worthy?: Since 1982 I have been a fan of Duran Duran & their music. And with their latest ""Pop Trash"", must admit, on the first listen, my expectations had not been met to their fullest. HOWEVER, by the 3rd listen, I was hooked! Every song on this album is worthy of listening to. ""Playing w/Uranium"", & ""Something To Remember"" are excellent. Do think they could've had a few more up-tempo songs on this CD, however, not bad for some ""80's has-beens"" (as most of their critics like to refer to them by), but Duran Duran is very much alive! Their live shows only prove how withstanding their music really is...""Pop Trash"" is certainly not trash; if you give it more than a listen or two, chances are, it will grow on you."
"Positive","Stinks to Some, I Like It: My wife thinks this soap smells disgusting, but I like it. At first, I admit, it was a bit strong (woody smell), but it's grown on me and I use it as a face wash every day on my adult acne-prone skin."
"Negative","Iif I had only known: If I had only known how they clean it up. I purchased three albums all clean versions for my 11 year old son that loves SOAD and I had stopped listening around him due to the language. The clean version just blanks out most of the offensive word but any one listening knows what they said.Not very happy but not sure what I expected."
"Positive","Good tips!: I read this book several years ago, and I was very pleased with how pleased my man was after I tried several of the tips in the book. I lent the book to a friend and never got it back, so I bought it again recently to review, and again, my man is quite happy with the new things I've learned to do from this book. It's also a lot of fun at a bachelorette party, or any party where it's ""just the girls"", so that the information can be shared, and so that others can be encouraged to tell their fun stories."
"Positive","Must-see for ANYone wanting to play Irish music: This is with out question the best product on the market for understanding the melodic and rhythmic intricacies of Irish music. Very easy to follow and informative without being academic and boring. I heartily recommend it to beginners and veteran players alike."
"Negative","impressive performance but.....: had to order two more since two of them quit working. I originally ordered two but they quit working after awhile."
"Negative","Terrible story for children: Our family loves Curious George, but this book is absolutely horrible. It is a relic from an earlier world. The man captures George, puts him in a sack and takes him off to put him in a zoo. George smokes, as do a lot of other people in the book. Try to explain to a 2 or 3 year old why George is having a nice smoke before bed. Or try to explain why the man has captured George, stuffed him in a sack and taken him to live in a zoo. Other Curious George books are really great - we love the ones where he gets a bike, goes to the beach, goes to a Halloween party and goes to the pizzaria. However, the only way we can look at this one is after I cut out a lot of the pages."
"Positive","Out standing book: This is my first time reading a Francis Ray book but from what I read I hook. Keep up the good work."
"Negative","Worst Sandler Movie Ever: This Movie should have been named ""You don't mess with Sandler's crotch"" because the entire movie is focused around Adam Sandler's crotch. I don't even want to think about what the unrated version is like. If you have a ""special thing"" for old ladies and adam sandler ;P then you might really enjoy this flick, otherwise, I recommend you stay away from it."
"Positive","elaine: recieved in excellent condition -love this author - book a little dry and ""scientific"" but very enjoyable.He's a great writer"
"Positive","Stylist-recommended: I treat myself on vacation by going to the salon and spa. I asked my high-priced Vegas stylist what I can buy when I get home that won't break the bank. She recommended Biolage by Matrix. I find that not only does my color last longer but the shampoo does as well! You don't need much to work up a good lather. I also purchasedBiolage by Matrix Color Care Conditioner 33.8 Ounceswhich is also perfect.I will be buying this again - that is when it finally runs out!"
"Negative","Dangerously Thin: If you are looking for 14 GA wire because you intend to have long runs or put a good bit of power through it, this is definitely not the speaker wire you want to buy. The wire and the protective jacket combined are about 14 GA, which means each of them is ridiculously thin. The jacket offers little protection, and the strands are so thin that they look like they would break easily.I was foolish and ignored the other reviews, because I thought even 16 GA would be alright. Many people get thicker wire than they need anyway. But I wouldn't use this wire except on something like a Home Theater in a Box, or something similar with little power, short runs, and/or low expectations on sound quality. If you are thinking to buy this because it's a good deal, then compare it to other 100' spools of 18 Gauge speaker wire. Even then, consider that this likely has a thinner jacket than most other 18 GA wires you find, and you would probably be better off to go with something else."
"Positive","Hunger Game Good Movie: A really Good movie. Saw it in the theater and when I needed something extra for my $25 free shipping it was a great choice."
"Negative","A Fairly Weak Collection: Decent submissions from Tom Drury, Jeffrey Eugenides, Melanie Rae Thon and Jonathan Franzen, but overall the choices don't really smack of greatness. Plus, many of the entries feel too much like bits of novels yanked out of the overall context of the novel itself, so that in a vacuum, they pretty much whither away. There's also some fairly glaring omissions here (no David Foster Wallace or Richard Powers? What planet are these people from???), but I guess beauty's in the eye. Or whatever"
"Positive","A movie? Nah -- a Roadrunner cartoon!: Hansom Stranger (Arnold Schwartzenegger), a heroic dim bulb, tries to protect the person and property of a sweet young thang (played by Ann-Margret) on a trek across the desert. The Villain (Kirk Douglas) pursues them, sometimes with difficulty (as when they drive into a tunnel painted on a rock).The smartest character in the movie is Kirk's horse. You'll love the ending."
"Positive","More of an eyewitness perspective than a full, in-depth report: The deepest feeling I come away with is a ""You were there"" sort of idea. Details are vivid - my favorite is the depiction of the first Right to Life march in D.C., when police went to arrest some of the protestors, who happened to be Pentecostals who suddenly felt the Spirit, began speaking in tongues and rolling on the ground. The police retreated, briefly.Of course, given such vivid ""you were there"" detail, one has to question how much of this account is mere perspective, how much is fact. As such, it is a useful, though not central, work in studying the pro-life movement, and certainly not a theological or sociological treatise. The book accomplishes what it intends to do, which is to describe the development of the pro-life movement in very human terms. For that it earns 4 stars."
"Positive","first-rate horror: Michael graves has indeed high expectations to measure up to, but he does indeed accomplish that and lends the matured melodic Horror-Punk sound of this album his brilliant and charismatic vocals. Still they keep to their unique characteristics and although Famous Monsters has shifted even more into the Punk-Rock corner, they still have their cutting edge and allow you to enter a gloomy B-movie world while listening to the songs. This album is clearly proof that the Misfits were and are much more than just relying on Danzig's great vocals."
"Positive","Power hand plow: Tool provides leverage and balance for weeding, cultivating and loosening soil, from sand to packed clay."
"Positive","Smoked with the best of them: This smoker is a great buy. I ended up getting a PID because the temp would vary due to the wind, but other than that I am very impressed! To be able to set it and forget it is a wonderful thing. My first smoke included some beer jerkey and a pork tender loin. Both turned out amazing! My friend who is an award winning BBQ chief said that the pork tender loin I cooked in it was one of the best he has ever tasted. Now he is looking to purchase a bradley! Cheers!!!"
"Positive","living out the dream: this is a great cd.I bought it for 3 songs on it,but there are more songs that are great too."
"Negative","Impossible to differentiate between nipple sizes; leaky too...: I generally like Dr. Brown's bottles, although admittedly they do leak on a consistent basis. But by far the most frustrating aspect of these bottles are the impossible-to-read labels found on the underside of the nipple. My twins alternate between level 1 (for breastmilk), Level 2 (for formula), and the Y cut (for formula thickened with cereal). It is ridiculously difficult to read the transparent raised label on the underside of the nipple, especially when it is a bleary-eyed attempt in the middle of the night.If I didn't get these for free from a friend, I never would have stuck with the brand."
"Negative","Junk Made in China: Ordered three of these batteries. Two of the three were found to be defective. They were a bit too short and did not fit snuggly in the battery compartment of the phone. Consequently, they could not make contact with the phone terminals. Returned the two defective batteries to Amazon and they sent out 3 replacements (even though I had returned only two). All three of the replacement batteries were also defective. They do not make contact with the terminals. Does not surprise me since the batteries are made in China. Would not even considering ordering these again."
"Positive","See This Movie: This movie delivers a beautiful and simple song to the soul. Amazingly poignant performances with down home charm."
"Negative","Worst movie ever. Ratings were lying.: Watching this movie made me loose faith in humanity. Not even close to soft core porn. The music was cheesy."
"Negative","Lots of words; little reward: Tedious. Not entertaining. The motto of this epic should be 'If 10 words will do, use 1000.' The author would make a great technical writer. He could give an excellent 500 page summary on how to build a watch. But don't read it if you don't have the time."
"Negative","Wasted my time: Truly a Sad tale writen by a woman whose husband left her for his true love, his high school sweet heart. (Judged by this book, he did the right thing.) Laura Fraser's ""Italian Affair"" is nothing special, and very uninteresting. Now Fraser's book rests in my Trash can on its way to the city dump. It is a boring story of a middle age woman who travel thorugh Italy alone. We all have similar experiences in Italy, but not all of us will be so available nor insensitive enough to write about these boring encounters. I know I will not read anything written by Laura Fraser ever again in the future. At least I gained this knowledge."
"Positive","it opens my ears & soul to Hank: i was waiting for years for an album which was able to wave my feelings i find it"
"Negative","Poor Design; Not for Dishwasher: The metal ""tang"" inside the rubber handle of this spade does not go to the end, so when you are wrenching on the thing to dig out hard ice cream, the rubber at the end will bend in your palm and you cannot get any force applied. Also, the coating on the spade does come off in the dishwasher. There IS a no dishwashing warning on it, but the point is that that is very inconvenient."
"Negative","Disappointing: The advice is too general and commonplace. I found this book to be greatly inferior to Stephanie Winston's Getting Organized and Lehmkuhl and Lamping's Organizing for the Creative Person. For someone really trying to come to terms to with their clutter and messiness, those two books are the place to start."
"Positive","Awesome: This pillow is simply awesome! I have Cervical DDD and don't get much sleep with this pillow I slept better than I have in the past year. So happy I purchased it. Gonna buy a spare for to have at my parents!!"
"Positive","Not bad overview, but could have been better: I recommend CAMEL to everyone. Why is this band so forgotten? Andrew Latimer should be up there with Jeff Beck and Clapton etc...The song choices on this compilation are good, but not great. CAMEL has so much more to offer the listener than some of these questionable pieces selected for this disc.I own this collection. But the real heart of this band lies with either ""THE SNOW GOOSE"" or ""NUDE"". These both are classic, classic, classic prog albums that will melt your brain and then put things in perspective for you.All in all, CAMEL is superb. If you don't want to buy individual albums, buy this. If you're ready to start a relationship with this animal, start with ""THE SNOW GOOSE""."
"Negative","A waste of time: I read over a hundred pages of this book, only to chuck it in the library return pile. For most of the first half of the story, the protagonist just runs around using her new-found powers in silly ways. She doesn't seem to suffer any ill effects from this. She doesn't grow as a person. She doesn't change. And it isn't even all that amusing.The story hints at depth--Gyp's abusive mother; the disparity between the magical and non-magical in a marriage; life-threatening illness; a power of curses--but none of it ever seems to pan out. The story offers an ocean of possibility, and we're stuck in the wading pool with little kiddie water-wings.I'm just annoyed I wasted the time I did."
"Positive","Relaxing and Fun: I bought this cd after hearing one of the artists songs on myspace and loving it. I was not let down--this entire CD is relaxing and a lot of fun. I highly recommend it."
"Negative","Great beats, butchered vocals.: I'm getting sick of remixes nowadays, what with their philosophy of ""we'll make a good trance song, then throw in a few samples of the original track at the last minute"". When a song has vocals this good (and few do), why in God's name would you strip them out and just loop one line?! Of all five tracks, only two have more than one verse included, and only one remains faithful to the feeling of the original. This track, the last one, is actually a very cool remix and the only thing saving this disc from complete failure. Oh yeah, whatever happened to including the album mix on singles as well? Is it just an evil sceme to get us to buy the GAWD-AWEFUL domsestic release of ""Movement in Still Life"", rather than paying a few dollars more for the far, far, FAR superior double disc import? Why, BT, WHY?!!"
"Positive","amaaazing: one of the best trance hits. i love every remix of this song but my favourite has to be the gabriel & dresden chillout mix...by far. amazing song."
"Negative","Don't Buy This If You Respect Yourself: I love horror movies. I really do. This isn't a horror movie, it's just horrible. After the first few minutes, the only reason I continued to watch this was because my boyfriend was watching it and there wasn't anything better to do. It's awful. I don't get why people think this is a good movie or even comparable to the exorcist. It's slow moving and just plain BAD. I don't get how it gives you something to think about...I'm convinced these people are just in denial about how awful this movie really was and they're trying to talk themselves into liking it."
"Positive","exactly what I ordered: I purchased this product for hair conditioner. I saw this idea on pintrist and it works wonderful as a deep conditioner. It arrived very quick."
"Positive","80s Horror at its Best: Good clean fun. This sleazy horror film is quite graphic and very enjoyable.I sought out this movie for one reason only - Momma! she is played by a lady called Rose Ross. Now the name will mean almost nothing to most film fans - but when you see her, classic TV fans should gasp with amazement. Rose Ross is none other than Emma Ritzik from Sgt Bilko / Lucille Toody from Car 54 Where Are you alias actress Bea(trice) Pons. As far as I have been able to tell, she only used this name for this one movie credit."
"Negative","this is worse than horrible. this is trash.: i recently bought my first dvd player. my neighbors knew this, so they gave me this dvd for christmas, knowing my appreciation for john lennon. i'll never tell the neighbors, but this thing is horrible. i was shocked by how bad it was. the liner notes do not match the content. the longest section shows m.d.c. detailing the events of that night. who wants that? kate millet then tries to fill us in on lennon's death... wait a minute. i don't know WHAT she was talking about.this whole thing is hideous. this is bad. you do not want to own this. this is embarrassing. now....what do i tell the neighors?"
"Negative","Don't Make the Same Mistake I Did: Pass this journal right on by, and get the older Wanderlust Travel Journal instead. The older version has a vinyl sleeve that makes it very durable, as well as pictures throughout and a great ""feel"" to it. The new USA version is exactly the opposite -- plain paper binding, no pictures at all (except on the cover) and basically, just a boring journal with THIN pages inside.It was a big disappointment, especially since the other Wanderlust products (such as the postcards) have much better quality."
"Positive","Jawsome Entertainment: The Street Sharks can really haul fin. Their intelligent creatures with a serious attitude. If you love the Extreme Dinosuars, you'll love the Streek Sharks too."
"Positive","Great Book: Crispy new anne rice novel. haven't had a chance to read it yet, but looking forward to reading it page by page"
"Positive","Classic Garwood: This has to be one of Garwood's classics. Very well written. The characters are excellent and mesh together well. We also meet characters for another of her books. I highly recommend this book as it is one of her best."
"Negative","+: weakThe best product reviews include: •An explanation for what you liked or disliked about the product•Product pros and cons•Facts and feature details•Comparisons to similar productsFor more information, please visit our Customer Review guidelines."
"Negative","a piece of junk: Sure, if you can get past his stereotypes of Native Americans and other ethnic groups; his homophobia; and his racism; then you might actually enjoy this book. I take that back. Mr. Vidal is so full of himself, so self-conscious of his sentences, that its impossible to focus on the story. He's always smirking and trying to show why he's smarter than someone else. It might be better if he picked up some of the classics and learned a lesson or two. Is he iconoclastic? No, just close minded."
"Positive","Guitaragas: The late 1960s were a time of raw innovation, cultural blendings, genre bendings, and what-the-hell experiments. In A=MH2, Mick Hutchinson took the blues guitar stylings of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, Fleetwood Mac, Chicken Shack and The Groundhogs and blended them with the trance-inducing rhythmic pulse of Indian music. Ragas for blues guitar, in a word.The results were not entirely successful, but nonetheless proved highly influential. Guitarists as diverse as Peter Green, John McLaughlin and Sonny Sharrock have cited this LP as a major influence, and Mick's talents were equal to any of them. Filled out by the saxes, keyboards and drums of Andy Clark, this album is an amazing historical document of a time when artists were free to try anything."
"Positive","HER WORDS: I think that the harsh reviews are somewhat due to the fact that her voice is not what it once was. But let's separate the singer from the songs. I still think the songs are good songs.She is sending a message with this album. True, it is sad that she is having substance abuse problems. I hope she comes through because I believe in her.I have to respect the fact that she is going to be herself and now what everyone else wants her to be. I think that is the main point of this album."
"Positive","Love these sisters: Great exercise tapes for someone who doesn't like to exercise and loves to belly dance. Tones important muscles used in dance. These are not belly dancing but you do refine some movements. More like drills. And learn some hand techniques. They are fun and fast. The fat burner one was too much bouncing for me. I need aerobic without impact. 30 minute of pleasure. I like to use these and have all their tapes."
"Positive","PANASONIC EXTRA HANDSET CORDLESS PHONE: ALREADY HAD THE BASE UNIT AND AN EXTRA HANDSET AND WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH ITS FEATURES AND QUALITY, BUT NEEDED ANOTHER UNIT IN ANOTHER PART OF THE HOUSE. BUYING THIS WAS NO-BRAINER! SHOULD HAVE DONE IT SOME TIME AGO. MUCH BETTER AND RELIABLE THAN ALL THE OTHER CHEAPLY MADE SETS I'VE HAD. SPEEDY DELIVERY FROM AMAZON AS USUAL."
"Negative","Blue and directionless: I like the album, but that's because I'm a softy. The production is still as spotless as it was on their debut; musically, they've fallen into the same pop/rock Venus fly trap that ensnares all but the best modern groups. ""Ten Days Late"" is fun (""Funny how you always cried out daddy,"" he says!) and there's a good line in ""Camouflage"" (""We walk along like a sequel/You're a cameo""), but it just isn't really good, particularly in comparison with their debut, which I thought was a knockout. Listening to ""Blue,"" I bet they've never heard the Joni Mitchell album."
"Negative","Heart of cinema darkness: While this movie is titled Journey to the Center of the Earth, you'd never know that it was based on Jules Verne's book of that title. It's a slow, boring journey to the center of something, with a few birds and a plesiosaur - no dinosaurs - and a few hairy people. By the time the cast meets the natives, the movie becomes more like a bad remake of Heart of Darkness, with a grizzled explorer ruling over the natives. Only that ends pretty quickly. On top of this, the acting is lousy and a teenage boy provides utterly useless narration (as if we needed him to tell us when a guy and girl are flirting). The only positive thing I can say is that the special effects weren't half bad for a made-for-TV movie. Overall, avoid at all costs."
"Positive","Utopia science fiction made special by Sturgeon: The Cosmic Rape (""To Marry Medusa"" is the short story from which it was expanded) tells the story of a wandering space conquerer who is shocked to discover that humans, unlike any other race it had ever known, did not have a group mind. Convinced that this is how it's meant to be, Medusa enlists the help of a born loser to put all the brainwaves back together again.The Cosmic Rape is one of these utopia vision sci-fi novels that seemed to populate the late 50s/early 60s. Sturgeon is a fine writer, and his recognizable style makes it immediately much more than the sum of its parts. The characters are grubbily and wonderfully real, even if the plot can't always say the same for itself.Recommended for fans of science fiction writing of the period, and for fans of Sturgeon."
"Positive","Good Information: I bought this book for my daughter and I found myself using it. Great for the teens and the teens in us all."
"Negative","important mistake! book should be classified as 'fiction'!!: i'm not sure how amazon made this big of a mistake!this book is clearly fiction -- so many parts have alreadybeen clearly identified as not having taken place.(see www.dailyhowler.com among other sites for details)important note to amazon: please fix this soon beforereaders get the mistaken impression that this is a non-fiction work!!thanks!"
"Positive","Pool table cover: Cover fixed great and it was only one I found that wasn't black. Won't last forever, but should get 3 or 4 years out of it."
"Negative","good acting but: good acting and kind of engaging but 2 hours of listening to people's pain - guys who are lying - who hate their job - is not my idea of entertainment."
"Positive","Mrs.: I am very happy with the performance of this radio/CD/Casette player. I have a more expensive one and it is horrible on reception where as this radio gives really good reception most of the time without even pulling the antenna up. It is light and I am very happy with it all aroundPamela S. ByloneVineland, NJ"
"Negative","This Beautiful Ballerina should stay in her box.: What a disappointment. My daughter (age 4) HAD to have this doll after viewing the commercial...and after only about 15 minutes playing with the doll, she said - I don't like this and threw it to the side. Meanwhile, my husband was using the box outside to change the oil in his car!! so I couldn't return it to the store.What can I say, except it is a very dull, uneventful doll.The ballet stand is flimsy (and the doll can't even grip onto it). My opinion: HUGE WASTE OF MONEY."
"Positive","Churchill China Brook Pink Gravy Boat and Stand Set: The gravy boat and stand were offered at a very good price. I was pleased with the appearance and quality of the piece. It was well packaged and arrived at the expected time."
"Negative","an assualt on everything square has strived for: when i first heard of this game i thought it was a joke.but square actully went through with it! this has got to be THE worst idea in the video game world.its hard to take a game seriously when goofy is in it. can you imagine, goofy fighting against cloud?! i cant beleave anyone would even consider this game! dont waste your money. if you want a good rpg go with squares other accomplishments and steer clear of disney. $[money]tword disneys next movie is what this is. if you have any sense at all you will pas this game up and not look back"
"Negative","Wished I didn't spend the money: So in buying this book for a comlpete brake job on my 1979 F350. I looked at every single page... Nothing in this book had the info I was looking for. I would suggest going to a local book store and seeing if the information that you realy need is in these books before buying saves time and money. Thank god I had the general knowledge to complete the job."
"Positive","Wacky Things Bedrock: I have loved the Flintstones for years. This movie is packed with all the wild and wacky inventions that the Flintstones have used through the years. From the ever popular elephant vaccuum to the bird hedge clippers. There are even some inventions that I never knew the Flintstones had. I think the movie was great and recommend it for all Flintstone lovers!"
"Positive","Amazing!: I had to read Alas, Babylon for an English class. I thought that it was going to be another boring Sci-Fi book which I could never understand. But Alas, Babylon hooks you at the begining till the very end! I absolutely loved this book! This weekend, the class was just suspose to read Chapters 1 and 2, but I could not put it down!!Alas, Babylon really makes you think about the Cold War, espiecally if you did not live during that time.This is an amazing book that I think anyone could enjoy!"
"Negative","Ours was a menace: After a year or two ours started turning itself onto high, staying on, and getting very, very hot. Its own temperature reading would be much higher than the set temperature. We just cut the cord and threw it in the trash. I just noticed that someone else had an identical problem. We have used a few space heaters, and I would suggest that for various safety reasons you get an oil radiator, but with an old-fashioned manual power switch (off-low-med-high) so that you can set it on low and know that it will stay there."
"Negative","What a load of tripe: Based solely on the clips of the first four songs, this album sounds like a total waste of money. The clips all sounded the same, and what they sounded like was a white teenage girl going ""wah!"" If I wanted to hear that, I'd go to the university cafeteria, tape the banal chatter of the local Delta Delta Delta sorostitutes, and pay some drunk frat boy to strum 3 chords for background music. Yeech.Who knows, maybe the other clips were better. I kind of doubt it, but maybe."
"Positive","Far above anything I have read on the subject: I would have liked to have known John Diamond. This book is not pretty about him versus the medical establishment, but it is real, it is truth, it gets to the heart of the matter and that's life and death and what you will do to keep on living. I admire his courage. I admire his family and friends for being there for him. I have not read anything like it and couldn't put it down. God bless you, John."
"Positive","mederma: At 9:30 a.m. Thanksgiving day I was bit in the face by a family dog. It was an accident, but this product was recommended by my doctor and seems to be helping with the scarring and healing."
"Positive","great: I recieved this within 3 business days. The price was great. It is in great condition. I could not wait for them to come any faster."
"Positive","the start of something new here: I don't even know where to begin to talk about this collection. First, I love Batman, he's one of my favorite character, and if handled properly, Superman can be complex and interesting too. Luckily, Jeph Loeb (who redefined Batman's early years) wrote it. He's got to be one of the great writers in the comic book world. For someone like myself who has been out of the DC universe for a while, there are some questions, like how did Luthor become president, and so on. But, even without the background information, this is a great tale."
"Positive","The gift: After reading this book myself, I decided to purchase copies for each one of the 8 managers in the office where I work. I distributed them as Christmas gifts. They all not only loved the gift, but was inspired by its contents."
"Positive","Mrs.: This is an outstanding Bible with many references and helps. This is actually a replacement for the same Bible that I have been using for years. It is nice to have the same Bible that I have been using but in better shape. Anyone interested in the Bible would benefit from this version."
"Positive","Gotta go!: This is really compact and comes with 3 bags to get you started as well as a plastic carrying bag. We haven't used it yet, but I put the 3 bags on it and have it stored in the carry bag in the car. This is small enough for a diaper bag or under the stroller. Really great idea for potty training and young children who can't ""hold it"" for very long."
"Negative","Not bad if it works.: This is my second sony camera. My last one just died and would not power up. Now I've had this T100 for a couple of years and it is a nice camera with histogram... if you get one that will last more than a few years that is. My pics now have a green tint and I've changed/reset all settings. I think the camera is dying. It isn't worth the money Sony wants to send these type of cameras in to get fixed .. So it's basically a dead camera. I won't buy another Sony."
"Negative","Good Flick, Terrible Blu-Ray: Though I really like the movie, this might be the worst looking blu-ray movie I've seen, and I own about 50. There is all kinds of light colored pixelization in the darker parts of the film that pulsates and distracts. I tried to find a feedback system on Paramount's web page, but no such thing seems to exist.Very disappointing."
"Negative","cheap: This phone feels & looks cheap. I have not found this phone to user friendly either. It was not worth the amount of money I paid for it."
"Negative","BAD BAD: THE ALL AMERICAN REJECTS. THE WORST BAND IN THE WORLD. INSTEAD OF THIS BUY ST ANGER THE METALLICA CD THE KINGS OF HEAVY METAL INSTEAD OF THE QUEENS OF SOFT PILLOW REJECTS ALL AMERICAN REJECTS I MEAN!"
"Positive","AWSOME!: This game is spectacular i had it for pc and it was great.The enviroment of Lost Heaven is so detailed.The missons are filled with gun shootouts! and alot of explosions.I reccomend that anyone who is upsessed with Mafia History should get this game!"
"Negative","Carving: The book High Relief Wood Carving/W.J.Schnute---this book did very little for me its in black and white few color pages very little instruction,not a very good book for learning good as a general reference book.Might be ok to carve signs,but overall it lacks in detailed explainations and generaly not a very good book on carving although the cover shows otherwise."
"Positive","Softest sheets ever!: These sheets are buttery soft and continue to get softer with each washing. I was worried that they would be stiff like people complained of for the 800 count, but the egyptian cotton must make all the difference.I have a 14 inch mattress and they fit with extra room for a higher bed.My only issue, which I'm sure is common on high thread count sheets, is that they wrinkle up a lot. I ironed the pillow cases since they will be the only thing visible, but will probably just steam them in the future. The wrinkles do not affect the feel of the sheets and are something I can live with."
"Negative","i was not impressed.: Neil Gaiman created another world below London called ""London Below"" that is unimaginative and disappointing. It was a silly attempt."
"Positive","Outstanding album, simply breathtaking!!!: Martina Mcbride's ""Greatest Hits Album"" is simply awesome!!!All of her hard work payed off and it is displayedin one collection of excellent hits. In addition to hertop number one songs throught out the years, such as Independence Day, Broken Wing,Wild Angels, I love you and Valentine, you can also find four additional tracks, When God Fearin' Women Get The Blues, Where would you be, Concrete Angel, Blessed, which will become top hits in the near future.Great Work Martina!!! Keep entertaining us, all the best to you!!!"
"Negative","Shot after a year and a half: When I first used this Coffee Maker I fell in love, It worked great and made one heck of a cup of coffee....As much care as I showed this thing I thought it would last forever. That was however not the case, ..."
"Positive","Well worth the wait: This 3 cd set is what I've been waiting for.It captures the essence of what Grand Funk was and is a peoples band.These songs cover the entire ""feel' of GF's early R&B soul beginings to a more polished end product.Personally I could have done without the first three songs on disc one from the ""The Pack"",Getting Into The Sun, Can't be To Long,and Got This Thing On The Move.It would've been better to have the Grand Funk versions of these songs.I enjoyed this cd set it's very good and well worth the wait."
"Positive","Excellent Theory and Well Worth a Read: I won't wax poetic or philosophical about this book, but I found it very helpful. The authors provide very good sound information on how to approach compulsive overeating without being over preachy or using too much ""psychobabble."" I have tried to read other books on compulsive overeating and found them a bit depressing.I can't say that I have actually been able to follow this. My issues with food run a bit more deep, but I did receive a new outlook on food and my own personal behavoirs. I am a work in progress, but I think this is a wonderful resourse.Highly recommended for anyone who feels that they eat at times when they are not specifically hungry."
"Negative","price on vhs: If it is a VHS, the price should NOT be more than $5, infact, should only be $2 + shipping & handling. NO WAY am I gonna buy it @ that price if it's not a DVD. I'm shocked that these movies (fav's of my childhood) haven't been converted to dvd! :-("
"Positive","An Old GEM: Buy this and Asylum Choir II and you will have a taste of Make Love Not War Boogie from the mid 60s to the early 70s. Two of my favorite albums back then. They haven't lost a thing over 40+ years."
"Positive","Wonderful: If you want to be carried away by the sound of crystal clear voices singng as though the angels were calling to you, buy this album. There is nothing more to say."
"Positive","Reasonable price, works as advertised.: The instruction manual may or may not be correct for your application. My Toyota Landcruiser took the 8mm banjo fitting although the manual said it would be the 12mm. No biggie, both were in the bag. Not the blow molded box in the picture, but a heavy plastic bag."
"Positive","Great Wallet: This wallet is exactly what I wanted...room for checkbook, credit cards, change and paper money. I especially like the 2 different compartments and that the leather is so soft...and at a great price!"
"Positive","Amazing: John Greens books are amazing. I know of no author who can transmit such intense emotions through the paper, and even though his books are generally considered youth novels, I find them highly intruiging even though I'm an adult."
"Negative","Really not worth it.: The blanket is not very warm at all, even when covered up with another blanket. Spend the $15 extra and get a decent electric blanket elsewhere."
"Negative","Horrible product: Bought this hoping to replace my aged PS/2 KVM so I can use my USB keyboard and mouse, no go. Mouse worked fine, monitor (17"" widescreen sony) worked fine, but my keyboard was a no go. It would work, for about 30 seconds, then I'd get that ""you just disconnected a USB device"" beep in windows and it would take about 4 seconds for the keyboard to start responding again. Kind of annoying when you're driving at high speeds through the streets of San Andreas and all of a sudden your car careens off the side of the road and stops for 5 seconds.My keyboard is a Viewsonic Slim Keyboard KU201."
"Positive","Awesome!!!: This isnt what si-fi is supposed to be!! Its supposed to be about robots and weird goings-on! This book is Wonderful!!It has humor, romance, and a time machine?? Awesome!This a comedy of errors when an overly agressive American decides to rebuild a cathedral in England that was destroyed during WWII. She uses her influance ($$) to overrun a colleges time machine, sending people back in time to check on all the details of the church. One of the historians accidentally brings back something from the past, causing the net (the time machine) to malfunction, shutting down and sending people to different places.Really a wonderful weekend read, I have read it @ least 6 times and could read it again tomorrow!"
"Positive","Not many pages, but what's on them's choice: Picture if you will Bertie Wooster from the Bertie and Jeeves stories of Wodehouse, thrust into a series of horrible Lovecraft situations. He responds with a series of hilarious non sequiturs and light-headed nitwit-isms, even when conversing with the locquacious and flowery characters of Lovecraft's most overwrought dialogue.The humor of these three tales is all in the contrast between the styles of the two masters, who must have been contemporaries of a sort, but who hailed from such different worlds. Peter Cannon takes this running joke about as far as it can go, borrowing liberally from the plots of several of HPL's most famous chillers, while Bertie supplies all the jokes from soup to nuts."
"Positive","Great price: I have wanted to read this book again for a long time. I was so glad to find a great price for a new copy."
"Positive","Rails and Ties: This is a wonderful heart touching film. As always Kevin Bacon is an excellent actor, bringing life to his role. Other performances also excellent!!Rented once and watched twice!!"
"Positive","Another great What If Novel: I love these novels that consider the ""What If."" And I am also fond of those authors that will take a chance on including Christian doctrine in them such as D. Shane Burton and Douglas Hirt. I would not even be offended if a Hindu or Islamic author wrote Sci-Fi and included their doctrine. They show lots of guts. The novel was an enjoyable read and kept me interested from the go."
"Positive","An excellent book for intermediate Sanskrit: This book is best suited for someone who has at least some Sanskrit, but for the student who has the basics, but is weak on vocabulary, this is an excellent text. The layout is similar to Sargeant's edition of the Bhagavad-Gita, but S gives a more complete syntactic overview and each verse has a prose retelling (in devanagari only), which is quite good for the intermediate student to practice vocabulary, grammar, and reading.With over 700 verses, this is an extensive text. There are some typos, but they should not trouble the average student."
"Negative","Not a clay/mud: Not even close to replacing Matrix Dirty Trix. This is more like a cream that hardens in the hair. Decent hold and less shine than a gel, but not the clay/mud I was looking for."
"Positive","Another government cover-up: For all you conspiracy theorists out there, this book is for you. James Sanders does a great job researching the material for this book and his arguments are clear and to the point. Its scary to think the government could actually cover-up anything like this, but if you remember the news conferences the government gave they changed their story at least four times. For example, the military confirmed there were missile tests in the area then this story was changed to avoid criticism. Also, there were around 200 witnesses that saw a streaking light going towards the plane before it exploded. The government gave many reasons for this, with the best being electrical currents from power lines, and even tried to discredit all the witnesses. Sanders talks about this and many other examples that readers will find both fascinating and scary at the same time."
"Positive","Missing a manual?: I would think that a pricey and sophisticated piece of technology such as this would include a somewhat lengthy manual with all sorts of warnings and cautions and instructions for use and/or troubleshooting... ya know, the usual? I know it's pretty straight-forward but still! I wasn't sure if it needed to be charged for hours or what? Well, it was a gift for my brother-in-law and he really needed it so he uses it all the time and loves it."
"Positive","Fantastic!: David Houston was truly one of a kind. I own all his albums and he is truly a legend in country music. Love this CD!"
"Negative","Not formatted properly DON'T ORDER: Bought this eBook because I happened across the print version in a colleague's library and loved it. I was very happy to see it listed, but upon downloading it I discovered that it was not scalable and in very small print (almost too small to see!). It seems that the poems are stored like PDF's or picture files, so they can be ""zoomed,"" but only slightly and are still too small to read. I have a request for a refund in and I hope Amazon makes good on this..."
"Positive","A Nice Product: This unit works great--I have no complaints. Here's what the experience of buying this unit has taught me:1) Spend the extra few $$ for the 7-port unit. I first was going to buy the 4-port version, but decided that the larger unit was probably a good bet. After I hooked it up, USB devices seemed to come out of the woodwork.2) I put the unit on my desktime, tucked behind my monitor. I've found that it's much more convenient to plug and unplug USB devices when the USB ports are near at hand. Even the two ports on the front of my DellDimension are less convenient, since the computer box is a few feet away.3) If you plug any USB 1.1 devices into this unit, all ports will work at the USB 1.1 speed. You'll lose the USB 2.0 speed advantage on the other ports. All of my devices are now USB 2.0, so this isn't an issue for me. If you have older 1.1 devices, this may be a real pain, though."
"Positive","Yankee Flipper Bird Feeder: This product does what it says. I have many, many squirrels inmy yard and the Yankee Flipper hangs on a 350+ year old oak treeinhabited by many of these furry creatures. None have been ableto feed but many have tried. I purchased this particular one for a friend."
"Negative","bad quality: even after tightening all screw, the chair and table are still not stable. Bad furnish on the surface. Generally speaking, low quality product. Not worth the money."
"Positive","Aerobics fan: I just got this recently..looking for some other rotations for my aerobics workouts. Even though the styles are dated in the video, David Gray and his team show a lot of enthusiasm. You'll feel the leg toning at the end. The only negative aspects are the too long breaks between workout segments, and I didn't find the push-ups necessary for this format."
"Negative","There's better out there!: I've owned every cordless sweeper that's been made that i know of....This Shark Sweeper AIN'T what it's advertised to be...first off it sounds like a loud whiny kid's toy and feels of equal quality. It picks up ""ok"" but nothing like ""the Boss"" or Black & Decker's cordless older model did. As for it being good at picking up along the sides of floorboards, etc. Blah....nothing impressive. I bought it because i'm in search of the perfect easy vacuum for stairs, well this definitely is NOT it. Spend less - buy the Boss - i've not found one better than it yet....and i've even shelled out [alot of money] for one of those German cordless vacs you see in some catalogs. Now if ORECK would come out with a cordless vac - then we might have something!"
"Negative","Won't work on Win 2000 or Win XP: Usually programs that work on Win 98 will work on Win XP and Win 2000. Not this one. Just be aware of this."
"Negative","A total Bore: I just wasted $15 bucks on an absolute piece of trash video. I love Creed and its music. I consider myself a big fan, and foolishly bought this video dispite the warning on Creed's home page about the poor quality of this video. I watched 15 minutes and had to turn it off because it was SO incredibly boring. No concert footage and no Creed music. All they show is still shots of one of their concerts, and they use the same 10 pictures over and over and over and over again. Then there are interviews with bar owners, DJs, and their pre-fame sound guy, all saying how the band ""was so incredibly special"" and they all miraculously knew Creed was going to make it big. Yeah, right. Don't bother buying this video."
"Negative","Wish I had waited before buying this DVD.: I fell in love with this movie when it aired on cable and even recorded it on my VCR, carefully pausing out the commercials. When Amazon notified me it had become available on DVD, I ordered it. I wish I had waited and seen these reviews before buying. I agree with everything said about the DVD's (lack of) quality; if this version had been my introduction to the movie, I would not have fallen in love with it. This is one DVD that's a definate down-grade instead of an upgrade. I'm keeping my VHS version."
"Positive","Frighteners!: I loved this movie! It exceeded my expectations! I loved the extras and seeing deleted scenes and bloopers. This was a GREAT buy!"
"Negative","wooow!!!: This was the worst parently video i have seen yet. It was an absoulte joke. I think PBS could have given me more insiteful information. I really think the person who wrote the review before me works for the people who created this crap. Not to mention this video was only 28 minutes. 28 minutes for $20 dollars what a rip off."
"Positive","Buy the book first.: Ed Soph is a master teacher and a master drummer. His work is always immpeccably prepared and valuable to anyone who takes the time to check it out. The essence of his material here is to be found in the BOOK/CD of the same name. This is clearly shown on the book cover and also the dvd cover ie we can read about it on-line.As consumers we have become used to having the most impressive stuff on the dvd, and the book as a back-up. In this case, it works the other way round. One could describe the material as being in the ""Beginner to Intermediate"" range and the cover could have made this clearer.However Mr Soph covers details that even some advanced players/teachers are not always aware of, so it's worth checking out regardless of level.The DVD is really like a follow up lesson to make sure you approach the book correctly. When one considers that you can buy the dvd for less than half the price of the average drum lesson, it's well worth a look."
"Positive","Pretty good, and really cheap: Overall I am very satisfied with this battery. It worked exactly as intended, with a perfect compatiblity to my razr and a good battery life. It is criminal to think how much more I could have paid at the verizon store. Good buy if you have a bad battery.If you fully charge and drain this battery regularly, it will hold a charge for about two full days."
"Positive","Interesting book about Michael Milken: Intertesting book about the mega-acquisition wave triggered by the creation of the junk-bond market. It will give you some info about the social-working atmosphere at Drexel and those who along with Milken surfed the biggest financial wave in the 80's. It is an easy-reading novel. Don't expect a thorough analysis about the Junk-Bond Market and its creation."
"Negative","I didn't like it.: I thought my child was going to love this dvd because she loves to watches in Baby First TV but when the made the dvd the play the same music constantly and gets to be annoying.I would not recommend it as a dvd."
"Positive","Very Hot - Their Best Effort To Date: I own all of QR's works, they have become one of my favorite groups (I used to go to Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane concerts in the late 60's and early 70's). I am writing this because I disagree with the 3 stars this album is shown with - it is much better than that. I like every song on this album, all but 3 are just super - show great talent of this group and incredible song composing abilities. Plus, no filthy language. Some other bands I like are Garbage, Weizer, 3 Doors Down, Guano Apes, Allman Brothers, Grateful Dead, Face to Face, Pixies."
"Negative","What the heck...?: Don't get me wrong, I LOVE THE SIMPSONS!!! But to me, it's just ridiculous how they keep changing the release date for the Season 3 DVD. Yes, this was when everything started getting good with the show and yes, it's twice as funny as Seasons 1 & 2 combined! There are other FOX programs on DVD that are already beyond Season 8 for crying out loud! Why can't they just make it already?! I don't care about the commentary! I just want the episodes! But no! We SHOULD be at the release for the Season 5 DVD by now! But they just HAD to change the date ALL the way to August?! WHY?!!! Why couldn't we just get the release date for July? ... I give the T.V. show 5 stars but ZERO for the DVD due to that this was supposed to be out a long time ago."
"Negative","Yech!: I bought this album for ""The Distance,"" an outstanding and mesmerizing song which is the only reason to give the album even two stars. Most of the other songs are awful. The lyrics are cold and repellent and the music forgettable. Don't waste your money unless you're a hard-core Cake fan."
"Negative","Horrible B grade movie: Tom should be totally embarrassed by this production! I want my money back! It was horrible! It looks like they shot this movie with an iPad! Cheap!"
"Positive","I LOVE ENDINGS LIKE THIS!: Fast reading, quick paced, surprise ending! I'm glad that Sue kept old characters out of book, (not that I don't love Rosy and Henry and Dietz) but this worked without them...AND think how much fun we'll have finding out what they were all doing why she was covering this case!"
"Negative","Schwarzeneggar's WORST: Do not see this movie. I made the mistake of paying [...]to see it in theaters and it was the worst investment I ever made. All I was hoping for was a no-brain, high-octane, extreme action-adventure movie with some one-liners from Arnold, a la Commando or, at best, Predator. But this movie could not even be a ""good-bad"" movie. It is just a bad, bad movie. The scenario is completely implausible, the dialogue idiotic, and the final sequence ridiculous. There were a couple explosions but no really good action sequences in the whole movie. Man, Schwarzeneggar has been bad before (End of Days) but this is terrible!"
"Negative","Dishonest: A quick scan through the pages will reassure you this book is recent 1999 and it covers the latest version JSDK 2.1. Five minutes after you get back from the bookshop you realise Mr Callaway or the publisher has been something less than honest.It describes JSDK 2.0 but text has been changed to say 2.1 e.g. references to c:\jsdk2.1\lib\jsdk.jar must have originally been c:\jsdk2.0\lib\jsdk.jar both \lib and jsdk.jar are present in version 2.0 but not 2.1"
"Negative","Another Poor Soap-dispensing scrubber: I don't know why no one seems to make a good hand-held soap-dispensing scrubber. Oxo makes a couple that look nice but their design is so poor that they break over and over. I thought I'd try this Cuisipro brand and ""assumed"" that maybe with the higher price, it would work better. The soap on the sponge attachment never seems to come out and make suds and the design is such that it doesn't fit down inside glasses and cups."
"Positive","So far so good: Ok, I have owned this camcorder for about 3 weeks and it has performed very well so far. The quality of the picture is very good. The high quality of the night shot picture in total darkness was a big surprise. For 50 bucks the infared hookup to the tv or vcr was a good choice. I wish the LCD screen could be a bit bigger, 2.5 is a little small. 3 inch would have been better. A word of advice, If you get the camera from somewhere other than a Ciurcut City or Best Buy type store you can get a very good three year extended warranty for ALOT less than a big chain store. Don't kid yourself, these cameras will break and a one year standard warranty is not enuogh to cover your approx. $1000 investment."
"Positive","A must have...: Excellent device.....Its got a superb sound quality if you live in a Apartment....I wish it has remote and power button, Overall im happy with the purchase."
"Negative","Deep Waste: Good effects but weak story line. Lots of great effects and sound (DVD). Movie not worth the time except for beauty of Famke Janssen who isn't on screen all that much"
"Positive","Sansa Silicon Skin Protector: Protects your Sansa Player from scratches and falls.Very good indeed I will recommend it anytime."
"Positive","The One Year Bible NIV: I set out to purchase a One Year Bible to aid me in my Bible-reading habits, but I was a little nervous about what would be sent to me since I wasn't standing in a bookstore to select my choice. However, the description of the item was very clear and very accurate. I was and still am quite pleased with my purchase :)"
"Positive","the instinct to love this book....: Reading this book, reiterated a regimen I once used to follow. Taking fish oil, (as one of the procedures). Could not believe how effective it was. Here I am on one of the worst days of my menstrual cycle (usually) day 27, smiling, relaxed, and totally happy, without a care in the world. So unusual is that for me. This book has a few other solutions such as excercise and acupuncture, and one of them is bound to work for you as well. Thanks David Servan-Schreiber, for writing this book!"
"Positive","The Sex-Starved Marriage: Boosting Your Marriage Libido: A Couple's...: The book had interesting facts to make you think and reassess your situation. Would recommend this book to anyone looking to improve their relationship"
"Positive","It Will Put A Spell On Ya...: This is the first D'Angelo album I've bought, and I have to say that I dove right into ""Voodoo"" with low expectations from the get-go. The other reviewers keep saying that D is mumbling and that the songs are too long. This is true... in addition to the fact that some songs are oh-so repetitive and the instruments could've been MUCH louder (check out the keyboard line on ""Feel Like Making Love""). And the cussing/rap verses... don't get me started. But what I did like about this album... is that he's D'Angelo. The person who kicked off the whole neo-soul genre. What I did like about this album is that D is in a league of his own. He's the guy that you compare every new jack to nowadays. Where do you think Musiq Soulchild got his style from. Exactly. Now if you can get past that... sit back, close your eyes and let the record play straight through."
"Negative","Incomplete and Disappointing: I wanted a digital version of Claire Davies excellent book ""The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guide for Pain Relief, Second Edition"" . Since there isn't one, I ordered this. I should have read the index first. Imagine my surprise and disappointment when I looked for ""serratus posterior superior"" - the muscle with my worst trigger points, and one of the most difficult to isolate - and found it missing! With such a glaring omission I can hardly trust the rest of the information in the book. Stick with the Davies book, and hope that a digital version is available soon."
"Negative","Typos Galore or Typos-R-Us would have been a better title: Throughout the reading it was annoying, but then came the games. At this time I have only went through the first game listed, but there were two typos in it. These are harder to figure out since it's not obvious which way to move your piece. I can only assume, based on the rest of the book, that the other games will also contain typos. The Editor of this book should seek another profession."
"Positive","Dexter does it again: Excellent Blu-Ray set of Dexter Season 6. Great bonus features and commentaries. I'll definitely be ordering Season 7 when it comes out."
"Negative","Not as good as this Amazon rating suggests...: I'm really surprised to see this sequel rated so highly. Although Carpenter penned the screenplay, it was very much lacking from his suspenseful direction.This entry suffers from not enough Jamie Lee Curtis, a different guy playing Michael Meyers(in a different physical-style) and a mish-mashed storyline that barely plods along. All of the killings happen quickly and without any of the buildup of suspense that made the first movie such a classic.Fans of the first will probably want to see this but it's strictly uninspired B-movie material all the way around. I think Esacape from L.A. was a more worthy sequel, and that's not sayin' much..."
"Negative","Mine are not lasting anywhere near 8000 hours: Purchased three of these bulbs, rated at 8000 hours life. In my application, they are on no more than 4 hours per day. One lasted less than one year and was replaced under warranty. Now a second has failed at about a year and a half and no more than 2000 hours. Seller says I must have bad luck. In my world 2 out of 3 is not bad luck, but more likely bad product."
"Positive","No Complaints: I have had this mower for roughly 6 years. Haven't had a single problem with it. I cleaned its air filter from time to time, changed its oil twice and the blades twice. That's about it. Starts on first string pull, no smoke. Clutch works without a hitch. It could use a bit more HP to cut bigger/thicker grass at higher speeds. I usually leave it in first gear to make sure the engine doesn't die when the grass is big or I push it myself."
"Negative","Hitler-Leader, but thankfully not of the world.: In response to the above statement. Hitler did commit genocide, but he was a leader. He led Germany. Leaders aren't necessarily good people who do good things."
"Positive","This book is absolutely great!: Hi!. My name is Peter. Our Dad takes us flying in a Cessna 180 and I can tell you that Vicki really captures the spirit and adventure of aviation.My Dad let us stay up late several nights because we just couldn't put this book down. During the day, I even took it to nursery school.I really liked the part about how Vicki keeps flying the plane even when she gets airsick in all the turbulence.She makes my sister and me want to live a life full of adventure. We think Vicki is a great girl. She is amazing.By following her story, she will inspire you to do amazing things, too."
"Negative","White Flashes: Can anyone tell me why this player when connected to a LG LCD TV screen via HDM Profigold cable makes white flashes ?What can I do for it to stop doing it?Thanks"
"Positive","Classic 1957 Elvis: The Jailhouse Rock soundtrack is a classic example of Elvis in 1957. Especially interesting is the movie version of Jailhouse Rock with vocal over dubs by The Jordanairs. Love me Tender songs are weak but Elvis does make them listenable."
"Negative","Grossly Disappointed: I have to disagree with the other two reviews. This is by far the worst bosstone cd to date. Other than everybodys better (which has radio written all over it) and ways to suday (which is blues driven) I really dont think this cd has much flair or personality. I have enjoyed every cd to date from the bosstones as each one has been unique and the songs dont run together. Jacknife is, unfortuantely, very dull. Too much of that ska influenced boring keyboard. I hope the cd will grow on me, my reviewing peers are off on this one. . . . listen to pay attention or devils night outLooking forward to a live show soon"
"Negative","Heard It Before: I've heard this ""out"" kind of jazz before, but played in more a melodic way. I think guitarist Tim Ziesmer has spent too much time in his basement emulating Ben Monder and Bill Frisell licks when he should have been focusing on developing a unique composing and improvisational style.Unfortunately, this album falls flat when you have somebody not being themselves and trying to be something they're not. Let's not kid ourselves, there is only one Frisell and Monder.The band seems lost half the time, but that's to be expected when you have somebody who don't know what they want to do as a leader.If you want to hear ambient jazz guitar music played right pick up some Bill Frisell, Ben Monder, John Abercrombie, Terje Rypdal, Steve Tibbetts, and David Torn."
"Positive","Great Toy!: My Son absolutely loves this toy...my only complaint is that there are not enough ""discs"" to be fired and they get lost pretty easily. Other than that, it's a rockin' toy!"
"Positive","Absolutely amazing: No doubt, this is the best purchase i ever made! I bought it about 5 years ago and it is still in perfect condition!"
"Negative","oh well: i know this is fiction but just didnt get the bluntness of the midnight man, and again just too much over explaining of things that could have been left out. I skipped alot of paragraghs."
"Positive","Very useful and discreet.: Good product. Blends in very well with my other books and is big enough to fit a small gun (.22,.380, small 9, etc.). I would recommend this to anyone who needs a little nook to hide some petty cash, jewelery or a weapon without having to lock it in a safe. That being said, never keep a loaded weapon anywhere that could be accessible by children.Good product. I would purchase another like it."
"Positive","Great collaboration: Saw Clapton interviewed on CBS Sunday Morning on 11/08. Clapton told the interviewer that, as much as he regrets to admit, he just can't do some of those things he used to be able to do on the guitar. More and more, Clapton is truly becoming ""Slowhand."" For the past several of his albums, that really bothered me. He seemed not only to be slowing down (hey, the man's in his sixties) but he also seemed to be writing songs just to fill up space. But, here, on this CD with his friend J. J. Cale as his musical mentor, Clapton's guitar work is stellar. Here, the ""Slowhand"" appelation is certainly appropriate, but there's a feeling here that Clapton has also found a new interest in his own playing. The songs are mostly Cale's and they're great stuff, but what's nice is how fresh and energized and interested Clapton sounds. By the way, have you seen the DVD of Clapton's Crossroad's Guitar Festival; it'll blow you away."
"Negative","Doesn't look like what I ordered: The item I ordered was a Menorah that looked more natural, the branches were random. The one I received is straight and traditional looking. I am not happy."
"Positive","Wow, I can't believe I missed this: Gene Eugene was such a fine and wonderful songwriter. It's tragic that he died so young. I love Adam Again and in searching for some of his other work I stumbled across this gem. Windows. What a great song about how God sees through our situations. I mean you really don't find artists writing like this now days. Brendon Heath with Give Me Your Eyes comes close in the concept, but it's hard to capture how God sees through our brokenness the way that Gene does. The whole album is good. I played it through twice today, and I'm getting ready to play it again."
"Negative","Photo: Never recieved the lens, so I just went with the canon 55-250 with IS and man that lens for the price and quality is outstanding."
"Negative","Horrible Sound Quality: I have a Sony HDR-SR11 which I am in love with for the price point and quality. I edit in Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro CS5, its a great camera, but his mic is horrible, I paid retail for it through sonystyle.com, I threw it in the trash and went out and got an extra mount for like $30 and bought the portable ""RODE MIC"", its around $179 but worth its weight in gold!Don't buy this, you will be sorry!"
"Negative","After 1.5 years, it broke.: I used this hair dryer for about 1.5 years. I started noticing a light strange smell coming from the hair dryer. I thought that the filter needed cleaning so I cleaned it out. A couple of weeks later, the hot or warm blowing options stopped working. Now it only blows cold air. What a waste of money!"
"Positive","Unfortunate wrong picture: I loved all the Gerber products I've owned so far. When my last Gerber multitool was stolen, I figured I would buy an exact replacement. The picture for this product IS the one I had. This multitool has a few difference which is the build quality and the blade. Not the same at all! I preferred the one I had but this is still a solid product. I'm just disappointed that the item I received is not the one displayed."
"Positive","Great reading for any teen...: Artemis Fowl is a brilliantly written book, that delves into an imaginary world like no other.Twelve-year-old genius Artemis Fowl, son of a missing criminal, discovers the secret elve world below the Earth's surface and also their large hoard of gold.Fowl devises what seems like a fool-proof plan, what with the help of his larger-than-life assistant and his incredible mind.But he doesn't count on the interference of one Captain Holly Short of the LEPrecon Unit, an elvish police outfit responsible for making sure humans never find out about their world.Short soon gets her hands messy in attempting to stop Fowl, and the ending is very exciting!Artemis Fowl is a great read for young people who enjoyed the Alex Rider Series by Anthony Horowitz, or the original 007 novels by Ian Fleming.I highly recommend this book, and the sequel, Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident."
"Negative","Zero Stars!: Oh my god this was just pathetic. It was funny as all heck but it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. This movie was terrible. Lucy Lu is not a good action figure. She was stiff and slow. She wasn't good in Charlie's Angels so it proves that Lu's friend Banderas helped her land this role.This movie was retarded and dumb. Banderas' acting ( or should I say STRUGGLING with words ) was numbing and he was wasted. His character ( as dumb as it was ) slowly diminished into a pod without a brain. Lu hogged up the screen with another one of her wooden performances. All she does is stare blank eyed at the camera. The special effects were old-fashioned. T2 did things like this in 91!Ballistic is just another big movie full of noise and bad acting. For their sakes Lu and Banderas better pray for a hit movie because Ballistic has sealed their careers' fate."
"Positive","Beacon of Insight: I'm a lifelong Democrat and agree with Zell's trumpet call for a return to decency. He rakes the extreme left over the coalswith his penetrating analysis and witty yarns. Great book!The book will make Zellmeisters cheer and wild eyed Democrats deeply ashamed of the appalling leadership displayed duringthe 2004 election."
"Negative","This one needs a no star rating!: Why did the people who gave this book a bad review, give it 2 stars? One was plenty! Also, he must have a lot of good friends to send in the 5 star reviews. Nuff-said!"
"Negative","A dated teenage girl's novel: ICE PALACE is probably a teenage girl's novel, as the main character is a young woman ""coming of age"". The pedantic ""facts about Alaska"" would also probably be better tolerated by a young reader, accustomed to the style from school books. However, the book was apparently written in the 1950s, and many of the facts, as well as expressions are dated. As a middle aged male, I found the novel to be weak, and I could not recommend it to another adult."
"Negative","Really Awful...: Based on comments about his other books maybe some day I'll try one of them...but this book was REALLY BAD. I'm an intelligent college-eductaed guy that reads 1-2 books per week (of all types) and I simply couldn't follow the story here. A muddy, improbable mess!"
"Negative","One month later--still no item!: I purchased this product exactly one month before I was supposed to give it as a birthday present. Here I am two days before the birthday, and I have yet to receive it.Even more concerning, the phone number for this company no longer works and the email section pops up an error message when I try to submit my complaint. To be fair, I did receive a return phone call from a customer sales rep about two weeks ago. However, I don't have anything to show for my purchase and as of now, no course of action to get a refund!"
"Negative","DON,T WASTE YOUR MONEY: I bought this to replace my factory radio. I found it and thought it would be a good unit to plug my ipod into, which is listen in my car. I decided to give it a try despite the reviews. I installed it and mentioned there was some noise coming from the unit. When I got in to listen to it, it was awful. It's enough to drive you to a homicidal rage. The prospect of listening to it for an entire car trip wasn't great, so i switched back to another unit, and i can't return this one because i have to make a custom braket to hold it in my car. Too bad...it was a low price for what looked like a simple product.Also this unit first thing noticed was the noise when engine was running.Don't waste your money on this piece of junk."
"Positive","Collection of essays and a novella: This book collects about three dozen Chuck Klosterman essays, mostly reprints from SPIN and other US magazines, with new introductions from the author. The first and strongest half of the book ""Things That Are True"" centers on music and includes profiles of modern greats Radiohead and Jeff Tweedy as well as classic legends like Robert Plant and Billy Joel. He documents a week of eating nothing but McDonalds' McNuggets (eight years before the film ""Supersize Me"") and watching 24 hours of VH1 Classic (and learning it repeats every eight hours). The next 100 pages are ""Things That Might Be True"" and feature more subjective content. The final section is a 35 page novella. I enjoyed the majority of these segments but liked Klosterman's other books better than this collection."
"Negative","What fun and joy: Simply put, this game is another version of Gauntlet Legends, a ""fun"" game where you run around and shoot monsters. This game, I noticed, is very much alike to that, so much that I knew what would come next in many levels, due to the fact that I had already played them. The only differences are the inability to turn off items, slightly improved graphics, different numbers, and different plot. I advise buying it only if you like mindless kill the enemy games that can be played while dictating your work."
"Negative","Charger-OK, Batteries-NO: The charger seems to work well, but these batteries were a huge disappointment. I assumed that because these were recommended as the choice of professional photographers, they must be good. Wrong. They did not hold their charge well, especially in storage, and once drained, never recharged fully. I bought Duracell rechargeables and they are infinitely better. Buy those instead."
"Positive","ONE OF THE BEST ""AMERICANA CDS OF 2000: Everybody that loves the music of Townes Van Zandt and Texas music lovers in general should buy this record, unfortunatelly only released in Europe. This is ""Americana"" in its best, a mix of blues, country, folk and rock, that explodes in a couple of great songs. The fact that Calvin Russell is better known in France and Germany then in Texas, is a tremendous injustice. Calvin is probably one of the best Texas troubadours alive. Buy this record!!! It's a must have to all ""americana"" fans."
"Positive","Ice Hunt: Buckle your seat belts, folks! This is what I love about Rollins. His books are so much fun. From the first page to the last, you are on such a unique ride. I don't want to spoil any of the action or surprises, but 'WOW'! And his characters are so enjoyable. Let's just say Kowalski is my favorite, and I'm sure you'll figure out why once you read the book. If you like action, suspense, and some great humor, I can't imagine how you wouldn't love Ice Hunt."
"Positive","This album is a must for trip-hop lovers!: Awesome!!!!! Whenever I am tired of work and I need to escape reality I put this cd on! Tracy Thorns vocals make me float on air and in no time I am in another world. Track no.10 is sure to get the place moving."
"Negative","It Lasted Two Years: Microwave lasted two years under normal household use. Worked in the morning, just a loud hum and no heating that evening. No point in trying to get a $100 microwave (or any electronics) repaired - minimum charge is ~$70 just to look at it. If you haven't priced parts, they cost more than the microwave. Toss it in the trash and buy another - just not a Sharp. Our first microwave, a Litton, lasted 20 years."
"Negative","what?????: a 2.4 ounce pack of crackers for how much? This doesn't make any sense. I am hoping this is some sort of mix up."
"Positive","Thought-provoking artistic literature: What can I say? White Oleander is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. The first time I read it, I couldn't put it down. And each time I return to re-reading it, I still can't put it down!Astrid's cruel, poetic mother, Ingrid, is sentenced to prison after killing her ex-boyfriend who left her for another woman. You're taken through Astrid's experiences at many foster homes. As she grows older, she learns more about herself as well as her mother, sexuality, religion, art, men, love, and the people around her, as well as her own past.I love the way the story is written, the language is rich and poetic. The characters feel like real people. When I'm reading the book, I often have to remind myself that it's not a real story, because it seems so real!My review doesn't even give this book justice. I seriously recommend this novel.Bravo to Janet Fitch!"
"Positive","Great buy !: This helmet is perfect. Just as one would expect to be. It fits well and looks sturdy. The price was great as well . Thanks to Amazon ."
"Positive","Good Bag, Fits The Canon A10, A20, A40 Perfectly: I bought this bag to hold my Canon A20 because I needed a shoulder strap, and some space to put batteries. It's well constructed, and has a nice nifty pocket on the front. In it I store 4 spare AA size batteries and a CompactFlash card. The main pouch is zippered, and just the right size for the camera.The shoulder strap can also be used as a ""belt"": I thread it through the belt loops on my jeans and hook the two clips onto the bag. I do this because I don't wear a belt, so I can't use the belt loop on the back to secure it."
"Negative","CAN'T COUNT: I did order two of these items, but they only shipped one...bad business, why must fight for something that I did paid for in good faith"
"Positive","Really good sound and looks: I was looking for a good yet cheap set of speakers and came across the JBL Creature speakers. The looks got me right away and I am really satisfied with the sound quality. The sound clarity and bass is good and the speakers deliver sound to most corners of the room. The tweeters are surprisingly powerful for their size and I love the touch volume control.I recommend this product for an average sized bedroom or a small living room."
"Negative","Terrible Experience - Unit has never been right: Bought this unit in late 2004 and spent mearly $500... after only a few weeks it started failing with LOADING ERROR... I called JVC and they told me the problem would go away if I unplug the unit for awhile and it was transient. The LOADING ERRROR became more and more frequent until I could not even use the unit without it failing. At that point, JVC acknowledged it as a known problem. I sent it in at my expense to factory service in late 2005 for a ""permanent fix""... It was fine for a month or so then the LOADING ERRORS started again, getting more and more frequent. I put up with it until if got so frequent that I cannot use the unit for even an hour without getting a LOADING ERROR. I am trashing the unit now!! Using my dependable VHS recorder until I can get a new DVD burner."
"Negative","Horrible: This book was just horrible. No plot, no character development, and then there's the stupid fight scenes. I wonder if Jean Rabe could write a worse book."
"Negative","Big Waste!: First of all how can this be considered an ""enhancer"" when it requires you to use lowly RCA composite cables. Why downgrade from S-video or component connectors? Besides on most modern t.v.'s there are enough video controls to adjust.At the very least (unless you have an older t.v.) you should wait for a model that supports S-video or component."
"Positive","BRINGING BACK THAT NEW YORK RAP: The first time I had heard of Oktober was on the compilation/mixtape Freshchest Affiliates and I have to say that I was very impressed, he featured on two tracks (NYC and Reset the game) and a freestyle. It was enough to convince me that I ought to check him out, so I went and picked up his album and well..I was very pleased.The production is top notch featuring a great mid ninties new york feel while also showing an updated new york vibe similar to the beats by Premo.Oktober has a great rhyme style and you can tell that he has a love for real hip hop, there are no over the top gangsta tales here just real street music from this Bronx Puerto Rican mc.It is a shame that most people will sleep on this, because Oktober has real talent featuring some banging beats with dope rhymes. This is a solid debut from the label that brought us Cunninlynguists(check them out also)and I look foreward to his new album. Give this a try."
"Negative","Retief gets burnout: The Retief stories by Laumer are for the most part light-hearted, fast-paced fun reads. ""Retief and the Rascals"" is none of the above. My only explanation is that Laumer was under pressure to produce another Retief story, and was forced to write this one while suffering acute dyspepsia."
"Negative","The Beastie Boys can never duplicate Paul's Boutique: In an attempt to return to their original hip-hop, old-school style the Beasties have put together a contrived and hasty album. The beats and the lyrics of ""Hello Nasty"" really never had a chance to live up to the expectations that listeneres would have for this record. The B-Boys need to stick to their old form which was what launched them to their stardom in the first place."
"Positive","a very good movie: to start out, ANY person who gives this movie 1 star, would not know a good movie if it came up bit them on the arm. DO NOT pay any attention to their review, Only mine is the one you follow. If you like war movies then this is the one to watch. Lots of blood, gore, guts. Good acting as well. LISIEN TO WHAT I'M SAYING. Watch it."
"Negative","Piece of Crap: Less than two months after receiving this item the printer indicated that the toner needed to be replaced. While it appears to be a Brother OEM toner cartridge, the quality of this item was completely lacking insofar as its being a ""High Capacity Toner."""
"Positive","Love it!: We checked this book out at the Library and my 3 year old LOVES IT!! She has most of it memorized and we have only had it for 2 weeks. She sings it and so does the family. My Mom, sister and I use to sing this song in the car when we were kids so I was thrilled to find the book. My 8 month old gets excited when we all sing it too. It is definitely a singing book. I am now looking to buy it and other versions. Again this book is wonderful!"
"Negative","NOT MUCH OF A MURDER...NOT MUCH OF A LOVE STORY: I can't find too many redeeming things to say about this novel. It surely isn't a good murder mystery since the killer and hero are obvious after a few chapters. It surely isn't a love story as the few love lines are poorly developed and totally implausible. The entire novel leaves you empty...can't sympathesize or identify with any of the characters and the setting, modern day Shanghai, is only partially developed. I just wish the author did some more fundamental thinking before he started the book."
"Negative","questionable safety for guitar, good seller took return: beautiful to look at but finish was chalky. really wanted this for xmas gift. bought lead test kit from home depot bc i couldn't find where it was made anywhere on guitar or box and was worried. 1st day result looked fine. later saw test sticks had changed color to kind of a brownish orange hue and red means lead and a slow result can be indicative of a different kind of lead than you see in the initial result. may be nothing, but i wasn't taking any chances. called luna to advise them of possible quality issue and returned guitar to seller."
"Positive","A Godsend for my dad: I bought this phone for my dad because he has horrible hearing and has never been able to really talk much on the phone (the receiver gives his hearing aids terrible feedback). Additionally, most speakerphones mute the other party when one or the other is talking, so you really can't have a true interactive conversation like we are used to doing on the receiver. This speakerphone made it possible for my dad to talk to his friends and family that can't come to visit in person. I live 6 hours from him, and all we used to be able to do is email, but now we can enjoy conversations again. I can't say enough good things about this phone."
"Positive","ROCKS ARE THE BEST!!!: This game is so much fun. I freakin love this game. They put so many rocks in this game. That is why this game is great."
"Positive","An inspiring, TRUE story: I have known Bob Muzikowski for three years now, and he never ceases to amaze me. Reading this book has been a revelation. If you're feeling cynical, or doubt that one man can make a difference in society, read this book. Muzikowski chronicles his life from a tough childhood to a self-destructive early adulthood through his current and permanent persona, a caring, compassionate person who genuinely wishes to spread goodwill. Hopefully, this story will inspire others to follow in Bob's footsteps, and love their neighbors. The narrative is alternately heartbreaking, hopeful, and humorous, but always honest. A seemingly endless parade of intriguing supporting ""characters"" add color depth to Muzikowski's infectiously interesting vignettes. Rather than see the Keanu Reeves/Hollywood version, read the real thing. Pass it on!"
"Negative","Emergency Undelete DOES NOT WORK!: Bookmstr's review is totally on the mark, except in my case it didn't find ANY files. Other programs at least saw all of my accidentally deleted files. This program showed me nothing. I even deleted a file and immediately tested it and it wouldn't find the file."
"Positive","Very happy with this product: I've been using Cellmass and N.O.-Xplode together for over a year now. Now honestly I can say it gives me energy..a lot of energy. I don't workout for more than a half hour a day, 2 or 3 times a week.At work 10 hour shifts other employees wonder where I get all my energy.I have gotten bigger muscles and gained 20 pounds. But I couldn't honestly say it was from using this stuff or just from my working out. I'm 55 years old so working out is a must for me. It gives me back 20 years of youth. I mostly take this stiff to help me go workout because I'll get lazy and not go.Sex drive is unbelievable using both the N.O. Explode and Cellmass. A plus I say.I don't have any unpleasant side effects unless I use too much. Try a scoop and see how you feel. Everyone's body is different so I wouldn't want say how much here."
"Positive","One of my all time Favs! BUY IT NOW!: Okay, so I bought this CD with the thought that it was cheap and I knew at least two of the songs were good. I expected to be sick of it in about a month, but I only paid $9.99 so that was okay. Wow, was I wrong! This Cd really changed my life. It made me see myself and everything in new ways. Nearly every song impacted me at a different time over the last year and a half. I can listen to it all the way through and depending on my mood one of the songs will definetly grab me! I disagree with the last reviewer on which are the best and worst songs, but agree with the fact that they are all solidly good songs that could easily stand on there own. The first time I really listened to the 9/11 song I was touch. Do not be on the fence about this CD, if you are considering it-trust me- buy it!Now I have to live with the fact that I went to see Godsmack instead of Yellowcard a month before I bought this CD..."
"Negative","Worst show ever - do NOT be fooled by the 5-star reviews!: This is the worst show ever produced - taking advantage of Seinfeld fans misguided loyalty, and the wrongful thought, that since this is made by Larry Davis, it has to be good... it don't!After a couple of episodes (if you actually get this deep into it before throwing away the dvd's) you realise that the dialogue actually follows the same structure and speech patterns that Seinfeld does - only this show has no proper actors or comedians to deliver the lines.It's stiff, slow, tries to hard but keeps on failing, annoying, embarrassing and quite frankly a disaster.I have no idea who these guys are that gives this 5 stars, but they have to be family of Larry's.I bought the entire series based on the stupid 5 star reviews and the fact that I too thought that 'Larry Davis, this can only be good' - but I've had to through the dvd's out without even seeing all the episodes.Waste of time and money!!!"
"Positive","Intriguing, but not wholly successful: Curious Steampunk foray, based on the wonderful premise that Charles Babbage's mechanical computer actually achieved practicality. As a consequence, the information age arrives concurrently with the industrial revolution. The plot consists of three vignettes that track the chain of custody of a case of valuable computer punch cards. The middle narrative dominates, and it's central character, Thomas Mallory, is the only character that achieves any depth, though Lawrence Oliphant is an intriguing historical figure. The story, it turns out, is narrated by Difference Engine itself, iterating the story of how it came to achieve self-consciousness. I liked the 19th century slang and historical detail. The alternative history touches require some knowledge of 19th century history and people; most are quite subtle and amusing. Not much by way of emotional payoff, though. Makes me want to read The Anubis Gates and Homonculus."
"Negative","Just another Self-Help book: I know everyone loves this book, but I was so bored with it. I think this book is about as basic as they come and, call me superficial, but I think Byron Katie is ""Loving What's On The Cover"". I'm not bitter against the woman, but putting yourself on the cover of a book with this title is asking for a joke or two. Anyway, about the book, I owned it, and I'm giving it to charity. I've read more than my fair share of self-help books, and this one, it's just NOT the one."
"Positive","Kids love it!: I bought this for my 1 and 3 year olds, and they have been in it daily since it arrived last month. It's big enough for them to play comfortably together, and small enough to keep in the house while we wait for better weather. My only complaint is that the pattern/texture on the floor traps a ton of dirt and crumbs, and is a pain to clean. I don't imagine that will matter once it moves outside as I can just hose it down. It seems pretty sturdy and they get a big kick out of the doorbell."
"Positive","Solid and pretty: Atlantic makes pretty good stuffs. I got this one on sale for $40 and loving it...the only tiny problem it have is standing on carpet because there isn't a wide footing on this thing, so you'd have to lean it against the wall if you gonna use it on a carpeted floor, other wise, it's really great, and pretty."
"Positive","DT830B ..... Useful & Cheap: The DT830B VOM is a dirt cheap useful tool.10A Max and yellow so you can find it.Comes with a battery too."
"Positive","Not Sure: I am not sure right now how well this product works. I shook the granules around the house and I saw Mickey twice. I also have a Rat Zapper which I know its avoiding because it saw what happened to its buddy. My three year old left a piece of bacon on the floor and it was there for three days without me knowing. There were no signs of mickey nibbling on it so I guess it works."
"Positive","A worth seeing thriller: Perfect Blue is the first physcological thriller to have ever disturbed in such a way.It also takes us to the darker part of stardom.You won't know what to think, each scene is unpredictable as the next. The voices in the dubbed version is well done with good acting.But be prepared for a confusing plot and mind bending questions."
"Positive","Great for airline travel: I purchased this carrier to use with my Peg Perego infant carseat when we took our first flight after the baby was born. I use the bugaboo frog system primarily, however did not wish to have the bugaboo damaged when I checked it at the gate (it is an expensive system). So, I checked the bugaboo in its padded travel case (accessory) as luggage, and used the Snap n Go to get us through the airport. It was a breeze to set up and take down, and the luggage handlers at the gate had it ready for me as we exited the plane. I would highly recommend purchasing this system if you have a bugaboo (or any other expensive or cumbersone travel system), and use it for airplane travel. The next time I travel, I may leave the bugaboo home."
"Negative","Star Wars Galaxies - ruined by 28 April 2005 Upgrade: I've been playing 4 accounts for almost a year. Star Wars was a whole world experience, where one could do more than simply fight. The latest upgrade has ruined the experience for me. They have changed it into a game like all the other MMPORGs out there. I played Star Wars BECAUSE of the differences. Changing Star Wars into a ""sci-fi"" version of EQ2 or WoW has taken away all the reasons I loved the game -- most notably being able to immerse myself in a whole world, not just a game.Do yourself a favor and play World of Warcraft or a first-person shooter game if that's how you want to play. Sony Online Entertainment has ignored its user base with these changes. Four accounts cancelled."
"Negative","The Unicorn Girl ( Acorna): This book was surprisingly disappointing. The author is well known and well loved for good reasons. However the main chracter was poorly developed. It was difficult to feel much empathy for her. The plot was good and the conflicts clear. However a friend of mine said it was like reading a book without a main character. I agree."
"Negative","Perma-Brew Re-usable Coffee Filter: It works good but I don't like the product because it takes a lot of water and time to clean it. Paper filters are so much more convenient to use. I can't recommend this product."
"Positive","Great bike for a great price!!: We purchased this bike for our 5 year old son this Christmas. The assembly only took about an hour, and was not complicated. Our son's face when he saw the bike was priceless, and he's spent hours on it since receiving it. It was a perfect price for his first 'big boy bike,' and he likes it much more than most other options in the store."
"Positive","Fascinating to listen to: This is a set of 4 CD's covering the Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Adventures of Tom Bombadil, and Silmarillian. The first two are snippets read by JRR Tolkein and the others are snippets of the Silmarilian. The collection goes together well, preserving the known recordings of JRR, and adding new ones by his son.These snippets make the character of Tolkein come alive in a way that merely reading the dead, motionless words on the page do not. His rendition of Gollum is amusing, light, and lively. His rendition of some of his other poetry (for example The Mewlips and The Hoard) is worth listening to more than the poems are worth reading.This is essential to the collection of any Tolkein fan. Highly recommended."
"Negative","No good, don't buy it: AvP2 is definately a masterpiece of gaming (I am refering to multiplayer, despite all the whiners and cheap weaponry on there), but this game is aweful. The single player is horrible and short, and it damages the multiplayer. How do you make predaliens more invincible and cheap? Give them a headbite so they can recover massive amounts of HP! How do you make it easier for marines to board themselves up in a room, making it impossible for the other two species to kill them? Give them robotic A.I. turret guns! These are things you FIX, not IMPROOVE UPON. Luckily, this is one of the few games that's out where it has a sucky expansion, but everyone plays the expansion anyway. There are an approximate total of only 10 or so servers at any time, most of which are void of players constantly. Everyone still plays AvP2, don't bother with this, there's no reason to get it what-so-ever."
"Negative","It had lots of info, but it was really Lovell's biography.: I am a sixth-grade student writing a research paper on Apollo 13, and I used your book as one of my sources. It was a very fact-filled book, but I thought it seemed more like Jim Lovell's biography. There was too much trivial information on Jim Lovell's young life and the Apollo 1 mission in which Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chafee were killed. What I was looking for was a comprehensible book about Apollo 13, and Apollo 13 only, not a book with half of it on what happened to Jim Lovell before he ever went on Apollo 13. I'm sorry if I sound offensive, because Ron Howard did make a very successful movie based on it, but if you don't think I ever give good comments, read my input for the Apollo 13 book ""Moon Shot"", by Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton, which I rated 5 stars."
"Positive","Battery Charger: This charger fits well into the electric socket and lays flat against the wall. It charges relatively fast but have not had a chance to use the recharge batteris as yet. I would recommend it overall."
"Positive","awesome move: Great movie. Continuation of the story from the Brandon Fraiser ""Journey to the center of the earth"" - it follows the same young boy - older - in search of his grandpa. Amazing visual effects. The mysterious island will keep your attention from start to finish. It delves into the relationship hurdles of: young love, family first and emphasizes the feeling that even if your family is not related by blood - there are stronger ties that bind - those of love. Perfect family movie. There is a bit of everything. Action? Most definitely. Adventure? OH YEAH! Romance? yup. Fun? OFF the RICHTER SCALE!"
"Positive","Good little cat fountain: I bought this because one of my male cats almost died from an emergency urinary blockage a couple of years ago. I thought this fountain might encourage him to drink more. It took my cats a few weeks to really get used to it, but now they seem to drink from it regularly (I left a regular bowl out just in case). The unit is almost silent in its operation, and is relatively easy to refill. I haven't cleaned the motor yet, which is recommended regularly. Otherwise, it seems to do the trick. It's not too big, and was fairly inexpensive. I'm not sure how long the little motor lasts, I guess even if it only lasts a year it would be worth the $19.99 price."
"Positive","Final Fantasy III: a good fun game overall, slow at the begining and difficult to accomplish begging tasks, but very fun."
"Positive","Some People Should LIsten To The Music...: Some other reviews are quite funny. The ""1's"" and ""0's"" are not actually figures, they are are light waves. The better the connections, insulation and shielding, do ACTUALLY make a huge difference, when used with a high quality system. Granted if you have a $49.99 DVD player from Wal-Mart the crappy connectors that came with it will work fine. If you have a $1500 Denon 2910 DVD player, then even the idiot from earlier review would hear a HUGE difference! Weather the value is there for YOUR system is up to you, I have all Monster Cable ULTRA or Higher in my system and KNOW Monster Cable Is worth every Penny!"
"Negative","horrible - what a disappointment: I love Lowell's 'Donovan' and 'Rarieties' series and am starting to read her backlist. Well, if this is and example of the 'romance' of the eighties I know why I only started reading it about a year ago. The 'hero' is utterly unbearable, and the heroin's ability to accept verbal abuse is pathological! He considers her a whore from bhe beginning to the end, and she not only forgives him, but justifies his attitude. Honestly, after the first 50 or so pages I started skimming - it was just too dumb for words. Save your money"
"Negative","Not good at all: I boought this equipment thinking I could get a decent bike workout in on a rainy/cold day. Wrong!!! Feel is all wrong, unstable and won't stay stationary unless you push it up against something. When pedaling, it does not turn smoothly and the smell of the rubber is awful. I gave mine to Goodwill in the hopes some poor soul who can't do any better could use it. Don't buy unless you're desperate."
"Positive","Good Product: I've had this case for several months now.The good:Lots of space inside.Mounts directly to the bottom of drive, allowing heat transfer in addition to the 60mm fan.The Bad:Data ribbon can block airflow from the fan.Feels cheap, but you shouldn't be playing basketball with your hard disks anyway."
"Negative","No Braclet in box!: I received the box timely, but the problem was it was empty, I have not found a way to let anyone know that I was ripped off!!! This was for my daughters Christmas and we were both really disappointed...I want a refund!!"
"Negative","aweful: I never received my order. After waiting 23+ days I finally received a refund.Would not recommend purchasing anything from Supermart....."
"Negative","I hate this spatula so much I am writing a review about it.: This morning I was too lazy to wash my dirty ""preferred"" spatulas and decided to give this one another shot. It was sitting in the bottom of the drawer for a reason and now I remember why. I was making scrambled eggs in a non stick pan that is in great condition. This spatula just can't get under eggs or pancakes (so what's the point of having it???) and leaves a yucky thin film of egg in the pan while the eggs slowly cooked on top. The immovable egg film is caused by the spatula's inability to get under. I never have this problem with any other spatula. It is so flimsy. Maybe someone will take it at my garage sale? This thing is useless."
"Negative","Would not recommend: Well, the only good thing about this product is that you can use regular household plastic garbage bags. Other than that it:1) Does a very poor job at controlling odors2) Difficult to open up to empty bag3) If you put wipes in by themselvet they can get stuckBy daughter is now 15 months and I am going out tomorrow to buy a new diaper pail"
"Positive","The Prime Directive.....: Okay, this wasn't too bad. The plot is about the Prime Directive and what it means. Well, an alien force and certain Star Fleet members express interest in a planet with regenerative properties. Their interests violates Star Fleet's golden rule, ""The Prime Directive"". The Federation may not interfere in the development of other civilizations. Picard makes a very hard choice and go against Star Fleet's golden rule. Picard and his crew must protect and defend the planet. Even if it means the end of their careers at Star Fleet."
"Positive","Tales of the Rat Fink: The story of Ed ""Big Daddy"" Roth was quite interesting. To see how his creations came about with the Rat Fink, his car creations and the insite into his younger years.A must watch for all Ed Roth fans i believe they will find it quite interesting."
"Positive","Review for the book 70-443: I passed 70-431 and turned right around to study for the next test. I used the Microsoft Press book for the last one and went with Microsoft on this test. I passed 70-443 on the first try, but read this book all the way through first. I did some of the hands-on examples, but I have a lot of experience with SQL Server 2005. I thought the book could have expanded more on Clustering and Partitioning. I found errors in the Chapter tests and other areas, so watch out. A lot of information was covered in 70-431 that is in this book. Don't get hung up on the repeat of information because you are taking all this information and taking a test over ""Case Studies"". The test will show you a company situation and then you must solve a problem. It is not just a ""fact test"" -- like ""What is the Workgroup edition memory limit?"" or something like that. There are a few chapters that I will reference, so this book will stay on my shelf."
"Positive","Looking at Ender's Game all anew: I respect Orson Scott Card a lot for innovating in his writing and trying new things. Ender's Shadow is a perfect representation of Card at his best. Ender's Shadow is essentially a retelling of Ender's Game through the character of Bean's eyes. While Ender and Bean were both brilliant students at Battle School, Card gives Bean a different and compelling backstory. Unlike Ender, who came from a middle-class American home, Bean rose from the mean streets but has genetically enhanced mental abilities. What I love is how Card toys with the parallel development of Bean and Ender. Ender, the lovable, friendly kid, becomes lonely through the burdens of command. Bean, the rough kid who depends only on himself, learns to form strong bonds with his troops.If you read Ender's Game and liked it, definitely read this book. Then reread Ender's Game again to really appreciate Card's ability to retell a story and make it fresh."
"Negative","piece of crap: I expected much better sound quality from this product. I can't give a fair review of the rest of its features because as soon as I heard a CD played I packed the thing back up for a refund. My husband bought this to replace the larger radio we currently use hoping to save space in the bathroom. In my opinion it simply isn't worth purchasing if you actually want music to sound GOOD...but what can you expect from $40?"
"Positive","Back saver!: We purchased this mainly because my husband's back was bothering him. The next day he said his back was feeling better and got a better night's sleep. It's been about a month now and no more complaints. I have chronic back pain and it has helped me some also. It just feels good to lay down on. Would definitely recommend not only for back issues but just for a little more coziness. Love it!"
"Negative","I was terribly dissapointed!: I waited and waited for these two episodes to come out since I just couldn't get enough of Cowboy Bebop. After this poor excuse of an ending came on Adult Swim that night, I wanted to mail a bomb to Japan! When Edward and Ein left the Bebop crew for good, the rest of the series episodes began going down in flames. Bad move right there. Sappy love stories and cliche rivalies between former friends has given this series a bad name. Hello people! This was suposed to be about bounty hunters that face action adventure and mayhem all the way through! In fact these are the same mistakes that most anime shows make. I only gave this two stars instead of one since it had some readical action in it."
"Positive","Near Top of the Line, with VerySlight Flaws!!: Yes, this is mostly a wonderful, realistic mystery where members of a family and 1800's guild end up dead for no apparent reason in 1973 England. Some fine characterisations, scenery, and 1970's culture, and classy writing throughout! Not to mention the intriguing interaction between the 2 eccentirc detectives in a new Crimes Unit. There is the by-now customary lack of fear among those linked with the victims,which seems very unrealistic, plus family squabbling that gets to be irritating. My main complaint is the solution,though interesting, seems somewhat over-inventive. Nonetheless, a very pleasant,interesting , and unique whodunnit that aproaches five-stars, but does not quite succeed"
"Negative","good coffee --lousy construction: I bought this coffee make about 8 months ago --it worked marvelously and made great coffee, however after about 6 months the latch on the grinder side quit working -- to get warranty or replacement takes forever and this is a common problem that melitta is aware of --- FOREWARNED"
"Positive","Rockin'!: The whole album is rocking..But the thing that upsets me the most is that ""Sprung Monkey - Don't you forget about me"" (Simple Minds cover) Didn't made it to the sndtrk..It's the best song in the movie..The song when priscillia is walking 2gether with here girls in the hallway should also have been here! Where can you find those songs? Kazaa and Grokster [is not good].."
"Negative","Waste of money: I tried this after reading many reviews, and wanting to treat my hypothyroid condition naturally.This was a total waste. I didn't feel any differently, and it didn't help me at all. I can not and will not recommend this.The company also claims that they have a refund policy; well, no they don't. I was run around in circles trying to get my refund, was told you have to wait this long, then you have to do it in this time frame, and so on and so forth. So if it doesn't work for you. Don't expect to get your money back."
"Negative","Rosalyn and Terry McMillan Are Two Different Writers!!!: I did not like this book. The plot was too unbelievable and I really did not like any of the characters. I did manage to read the entire book but found it to be quite disappointing. Two thumbs down."
"Positive","Missing track: There is a missing track on this cd. I cannot find the lyrics anywhere on the internet, nor the artist. It is the song that plays when Pete (in the movie) gets a bullseye in the bar and shouts for rosie but sees her and tad kissing (right before the bathroom scene).What is the damn name of the song! If anyone finds out please email me.. help@binaryelysium.com"
"Positive","A special kind of Syncopation !: What can you say about the AEC, always something fresh and original. I picked this 2 cd set up at my local record store in the discount bin for 3 bucks about 6 years ago and have probably played near a hundred times since then. great feel, soul licks, loose groove.... all the things that make the Art ensemble great, of course there's Jarmen on horns, how can you lose. pick it up. NOW !!!"
"Negative","Dissatisfied: Owning and using this printer has been a very frustrating experience. I've been using hp inks and paper, and printing from Adobe photoshop and Lightroom, and no matter what I do the prints look muddy. This printer is an energy hog - you have to leave it on all the time because if you turn it off it demands 3 full size sheets of glossy paper so that it can realign its printheads - wasting ink and paper! Lately I have been using it to print a logo and return address on stacks of postcards from Mircosoft Publisher, and it keeps telling me I have the wrong size paper (even when I *just* set the printing preferences). It also keeps telling me the carriage is jammed but most of the time the carriage will move just fine if I press the OK button - except that it spits out a half-printed card. What a waste!! It was expensive, takes up a lot of space, and not once has it turned out anything I've been really happy with. I would give it zero stars if I could."
"Negative","Fun Foods??: Well, Joy, I just love her, but The fun foods were fun but spoiled the fun weight loss! We (my husband and I) Did not lose an ounce and we were on it for at least one month. We switched to The Rotation Diet and I lost 17 pounds."
"Negative","Not indestructable, or practical, but kinda cool.: LIKES:-glows green - has on/off button for this feature.-nice rubbery texture.-one could roll it up relatively small, throw it around, etc. and probably not hurt it.-silent use.DISLIKES:-have to press hard/awckwardly because keys WOBBLE A LOT.-typing speed significantly reduced.-hand discomfort increased.-children can and will love to because of the rubbery feel-pull the keys off one by one- and quickly, too! (I thought, 'hey, indestructable, I can let him touch it for a sec...' Nope. In under ten seconds a key was ripped loose. The silicon is very thin and the keys are inviting to peel off, so watch out!"
"Negative","Made in China NOT Germany: This Weems & Plath Endurance Collection 085 Quartz Clock is made in China. It uses a hard to find type ""N"" battery."
"Positive","Kicking twilights butt: Interview with the vampire was one of the most fun books to read. It shows that however much a monster someone is, that they still feel the human need for companionship and belonging."
"Negative","Bad product, don't buy: Use it the first time to grill some steak. I put vegetable oil all over and food stuck to the coating like hell and it looks worser than my 20 year old charcoal grill. This is not non-stick even the product say it is. What a rip off. Read some of the comments here that it can only be used on low heat and need to soak overnight to clean. Am I reading this wrong, a stove top grill plate that can only use on low heat? What a piece of junk. My $10 non stick saute pan work better than that and it cleans off easily. I am throwing this junk away. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT IS A RIP OFF. WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE."
"Negative","Read the book, skip the movie: The movie doesn't come even close to the raw truth documented in the book. If you really want to understand Astrid and the story's uplifting ending, you must read the book."
"Negative","Broken only second time use!!!: Just use the second time and it becomes pretty hard to push, try to follow the manual to fix but can't find any cause. a handy man help to check it then found out there is a broken rubber belt in the machine and we can't get why there is a broken belt??!!! the belt is linked to bottom part of cleaner to make it easy to push, but we can't get why it's broken? Although the one we bought is used, when we received and used first time, it worked good. However, it's just second time to use it and it's broken!! We indeed follow the instruction to take care the cleaner and really don't understand how it happens. so bad... doubt the quality made in China is really unreliable...."
"Negative","Luck of the draw: These refurb units appear to be hit or miss with quality. The first I received had some buttons that did not work and it was nearly impossible to get the remote to charge in the cradle. I am returning it and hoping the replacement will be better. If not then I will ask for a refund.I have another Harmony remote and I like it, unfortunately the refurbs appear to be really hit or miss."
"Positive","Good book, worth reading: I liked this book a lot. It is something you could finish reading in a day or two and would help you more than the time you spent reading it. The 50 items were written to help you improve your overall understanding of the way C++ was meant to be coded, and it does succeeds in doing so. Some topics in this book may come off as being rather obvious but for the most part it won't make you worse at what you do, it'll only make you better."
"Positive","Not disappointed with this one!: Recently received my copy of the Southern Cook's Handbook, and I am delighted to recommend it to anyone interested in Southern home cooking. Not only excellent recipes, but a step-by-step guide to the methods of southern cooking as well. I have quite a collection of cookbooks, but I can see that I will be referring to this one quite frequently. Even after 40 years of marriage, I have gained new ideas after reading this book. Last night I made the creamy chicken salad, and we loved it! I will definitely be ordering more to give as wedding presents!"
"Positive","Loved this book: This was a great read. Easy, entertaining and it makes you think about the legal issues at hand in the book. Well written. I did not finish it until after Christmas was over and the ending still brought tears to my eyes. I got it as a free book and I am glad that I did."
"Negative","MAC OS X SERVER Administrator's Guide: I was looking for a book that would be a guide to OSX Server since the information included with the software was thin at best. What I found was a text that took the little information that I found in the documentation and puffed it up to over 300 pages with not much more to offer. In all fairness I did pick up some information but it was not worth the price. I'll keep the book on the shelf but it will not be looked at often."
"Positive","Last Splash makes a splash in alternative music upstream!: In 1993, there were a lot of girly grungy groups trying to thump out ear-piercing guitar licks and ""Last Splash"" has it all. It is a statement of ALTERNATIVE music. Not for all tastes, but it is a hummer to listen to after all the copycats out there. The Deal sisters crank out loud and noisy thrash enough to make your mother climb the walls. Play it LOUDER! Great album."
"Positive","canon binoculars: They were for my wife for Xmas. She loves them they were everything she hoped for and more. We are looking forward to using them in CostaRice in a few montths. Will update then"
"Negative","indifferent: It only hears big dogs. Little dogs can yap away. And my medium size agility mix learned that if he hit the test button with this nose, he could make the audible sound go off so he was doing it all the time. It has stopped the neighbor's big dogs from barking. It doesn't come with a power supply and it's an odd ball one or 4 D battries."
"Positive","A movie to watch with Grandchildren: Good movie, little gore, scary but shows human emotions in a positive way. Contains a few different main characters and how they react to an event that could cause major harm. The ending was positive as well. After the movie, grandchildren asked questions that caused a dialogue about people and how they should act toward one another."
"Positive","The Patriots DID win the superbowl!: A great piece of memorabilia to have if you're a Pats fan. I only wish they had some footage from the parade on there, where millions of fans waited hours on the coldest day of the year in Boston to cheer on the World Champions. If you enjoyed a few cocktails like I did, then this will help you ""remember"" all the important aspects of the SuperBowl."
"Negative","Now 11 is a stinker: I was never a fan of the Now series, but this cd is really bizarre. First they have rap and hip hop, then reggae, then techno, then dance, then latin, then pop, then classical, then country, then r+b, then jazz, then rock, then christian music. this cd is so stupid, the music is just way to diverse. it is obvious to me that whoever made this decided to just pull all of the top 20 songs off the billboard, then slap them on a cd for young naive teenagers to buy."
"Negative","What was with this?: For some reason with the sampler, it has no soul and intensity. The orchestra played some of his most energetic songs 'boooooom, boom boom' instead of 'bambam bam boom bam bam bam'. Okay. Ignore that. Johann is an excellent composer. However, this orchestra defeated the"
"Positive","Spot On!: As the wife of an aspirant deacon, I found this book informative and easy to read. It answered a lot of my questions."
"Negative","lawless: too much bad language and ugly and dark content, waiting for some more family oriented movies for our family to watch"
"Negative","misleading and disappointing!: book lacks zen teaching value...represents authors ambitions as a teacher. does not represent ""the intimate heart of zen""... nor does it contain zen wisdom or depth. tries to capitalize on zen phrases...but does not deliver. forward was written by thich nhat hanh who has written many insightful books....disappointed, am returning book."
"Negative","Right Wing Propaganda: Don't waste your money like I did, unless you enjoy watching far-fetched right wing propaganda films. It never ceases to amaze me how seemingly intelligent people can totally discredit themselves by putting this type of garbage out to the masses to try to gain some sort of political sway, it's just sad."
"Negative","No Auto Turn Off - Dangerous!: I left it on by mistake for four hours and my oven mitts that were sitting on the machine were burned black. It could be dangerous if you have children or pets or simply clumsy like me."
"Positive","A wonderful self-help book: I read this book when it first came out decades ago, and it's as appropriate today. Pretty much the premise is you can't control what other people do, only how you react. It's not your fault other people are ""broken"" and can't treat you with the love you deserve from certain relationships. Sometimes you just can't avoid these people who are in your life permanently and strike out at you at any possible moment. You can break the cycle. You can forgive and don't have to let their behavior change the way you react.I do love the fact this book is written in larger type so older folks like me can read it!"
"Negative","Ok: I had just started taking this supplement that was a different brand and it wasn't bad and I thought i would order more in bulk on line. This one is much more chalky like a tums than my previous one and I tried to keep taking them but have since stopped. Will try to find previous brand that was almost like a little desert after meals. It probably was sweetened or something but the texture and taste would be worth it."
"Positive","wow...: this is just a great album... it feels like a private concert with john and the band. i'd pick out my favorite track, but the album is just so good that it's hard to pick any out... my only complaint, if you could call it one, is that thefinal two tracks, under the boardwalk and wild night, were tacked on by his record company... but although they take away from the feeling of the album, they are still great tracks... all and all, this is definatley up there with the best that i could do as my favorite jm albums... now all we need is a live album and my collection would be complete..."
"Positive","Amongst the Label's elite: Steady Mobb'n's ""Black Mafia"" was VERY different from the cd's that No Limit put out in '98. (No Limit had 22 releases alone in 1998) What makes it so different could be one of many reasons, #1- They are from Oakland, CA....not New Orleans. #2- They can rhyme over any beat. or is it #3- They are just better emcees than anyone in the No Limit camp?! Either or, this cd was monumental to thier career. The highlight include ""No One"", ""Crosses Artist"", ""MG Theme"" and others."
"Negative","BUY A COMMERCIAL UNIT--NOT THIS ONE: I have to wonder if the people who like this unit have a clue.What is the most important characteristic of a fryer?TEMPERATURE!! If you cannot get at least 360 deg.f, then the unit is useless. This unit claims to go to 375 deg.fI measured the max temp of my unit (canola oil) with 2 known to be accurate thermometers.The result?Max temp is only 320 deg.fComplained to Waring who sent me a new heating unit. Installed same abd ran the same test with the same result--max temp is still only 320 deg.fThrew it away and bought a commercial Cecilware 6 pound countertop 120 volt fryer for $330. Works like a charm and can go to 375 deg.f, no problem.So save your money and go to the nearest restaurant supply house and get something that you can actually fry in."
"Positive","cash's last CD: First time i heard the songs I was a fan. A man at the end of his journey at peace with God and man, and that is reflected in each song. An old man still full of music and having fun with it .. as far as I am concerned, this CD has got meditational value as well. Peaceful but full of life at the same time .. I love it!"
"Positive","The Best: It's a must have for new parents. Our son loves it..very soothing and comforting. We used it non-stop when he was first born."
"Negative","Really Starting to Slip: What was beginning in season four continues: the inability of the writers to keep the story innovative and exciting. This season made me cringe AGAIN when CTU was attacked AGAIN by terrorists. The new characters are shallow and are horrible actors (with the exception of Milo-though he is technically a season one character returning). The show has run its course and I think should be nearing its end. The writers have killed off every interesting character by this point except Chloe. Watch through season 3 for sure, after that view at your own risk.Here is the order in my humble opinion.Season 3 - best seasonSeason 1Season 2Season 5Season 4Season 6 - worst season"
"Positive","Great: I enjoyed the movie very much! I definitely recomend seeing it! The cast was great, and the plot is catching. The score is extremely loud though."
"Positive","No thanks Dr. Hayward: Dr. Charlene Hayward was a dentist you did not want to cross.In the office or in your personal life.Always choosing someone else's man, and not having one of her on.Maybe it was an inherited thing. Like mother, like daughter even like hergrandmother which she dearly love.Charlene has some very serious issues. I guess you could say don't cross Dr. Hayward.A good read."
"Positive","Interesting Book: This is an interesting book because of its use of primary sources. Most history text books leave them to the side and others clumsily attempt to weave them in, but Ambrose and Brinkley fit them in nicely and use them to tell the story. It is an interesting read."
"Negative","Mac users left out in the cold: Bought this camera when it first came out, and it takes pretty good pics, but I have a Mac and Nikon does not keep up the software, including the wireless transfer, with Mac OS (I now use Lion). My next choice for camera will be a Canon, better pic quality and friendlier to Macs."
"Negative","Have not received item: I have not received this item. I have not received any information about the shipping of this item. It's the first time I have had a bad experience with amazon."
"Negative","junk!!: Bought this at a local hardware store, It sticks to the window fine but the temp is way off. Don't waste your money!!"
"Positive","Some of the best Rock n roll you can come by: During the first few moments of ""Welcome To The Jungle"" you can almost anticipate what this album is going to be like. From the police siren scream by Axl on Jungle to the very last solo on ""Rocket Queen"" this album packsa powerful punch throughout. The two guitar tandem of Izzy Stradlin and Slash rips out riffs better than almost anybody and bassist Duff Mckagan and Drummer Steve Adler keep the groove going throughout as Axl tells tales of the big city life. This is a fantastic album by any standard but the fact that it was their debut doubles its greatness. Standout Tracks like ""Sweet Child O' Mine"",""Paradise City"" and ""My Michelle"" have killer hooks riffs and lyrics. This is a must buy. Too bad this band couldn't have made more music like this."
"Positive","Great deburr, NO STORAGE?: Great for deburring holes and such, Lost 1 star for not having a place to store extra hardware within the handle"
"Positive","PHENOMENAL: I went out and got the new cd the other day and I haven't been able to put it down since. I keep a cd player at work and now I have all my co-workers hooked on 'SLOWVEIN', too. All the songs are totally rockin'. I especially love 'WINDOW SHOPPING' and 'PUSH brings a tear to my eye each time. So go out get this cd and enjoy more great music by SLOWVEIN. Jenniffer"
"Negative","High failure rate: The Deskstar 75GXP I bought failed with a head crash after three months. Apparently, these drives have an abnormally high failure rate. There's plenty of other inexpensive 80G hard drives around. Avoid this one."
"Negative","NOT WITH PLASMA TV: Does not work with plasma tv. aked manufacturer for help and they provided several things to try, but to no avail. Seller has not provided a reimbursement, and had poor response to problem"
"Negative","Sounder: I think Sounder is a fairly boring book, and i should know i'm a book worm. i read about half the book then i started skimming, becaus it was so boring. i mean almost no one but the dog had a name. i believe you have to have a name not just a description to make an interesting person. also i belive that it is based on a true story, and i find most of those to be boring. i recommend this for adults, but not for kids. they'd probally get tired of it in the first two chapters."
"Positive","Completely, exactly: This box set is wonderfully put together. Every Sun song in order on 3 discs with a detailed book. This is one of those box sets that just doesn't get any better than this. Its everything you want and how I would want to have put together for any artist. The shear raw beginnings is here and what the legend that we know from Johnny Cash. This is a great treasure you will enjoy. Stay 2nd :-)"
"Positive","does a good job: seems to be sturdy and durable in average use; reach is good; leaves skin feeling very clean; would recommend to others"
"Positive","Cool CD: I like this CD, especially songs like Immigrant and Employer. Agree with previous reviewer - very emotional."
"Positive","Excellent classics reborn.: This is the beginning of rpg heaven and the games that started the hugely popular rpg trend.Both games are 'tame' by todays standards but the fun factor is still beyond measure. Final Fantasy 1 and 2 both offer tons of great gameplay and will make you pass hours without even thinking.Though it seems that both games have gotten dramatically easier...Oh well, there are still things we can do to make things harder, like a solo white mage. :)"
"Negative","Disappointed but still a fan.: Can't hide my disappointment with this CD. I was looking forward to it, especially after attending the Idol concert in Raleigh. Unfortunately on this CD Clay is overpowered by background singers. There is also no diversity. Most of the songs sound the same to me. As an older fan I was hoping for some classic numbers like those Clay sang on the TV series. I won't be listening to this CD again. Hopefully whoever is responsible for it will learn from the experience and can produce something which will let Clay shine and reach out to his entire audience on his next CD."
"Positive","This CD is truly a great blessing to my collection!: Though Sis. Etta James is but one in a long line of great female blues/jazz singers, her unique style and grace are quite evident. It is also clear that there is a passion she sings with obviously due to the fact all the joy and/or pain in each song she has experienced AT LEAST once in her life. As is true for most African vocal artists, it is also clear she received her early training in The Church, the solid rock of our communities. THANK YOU SIS. ETTA JAMES FOR ALL THE GREAT MUSIC OF YOUR CAREER; MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU IN ALL FUTURE ENDEAVORS!"
"Positive","excelent price for a mac: This is not the last model, but only change the video card... not a big deal. for this price is the best choice."
"Negative","Robin Hood Begins!!!: The only other Robin Hood movie I've ever seen was the parody directed by Mel Brooks. I couldn't compare it to the previous films, but I understand this is a retelling of how Robin came to be who he was. It feels like an epic film, but it was very boring and drags on a few scenes. There are some intense battle sequences, and some humor. Crowe stars as Robin Longstride, a highly skilled archer who helps fight in battles, along with his 'merry men' Sir Godfrey sends his army to attack the people of Nottingham. At first, Lady Marion doesn't trust Robin, but she soon warms up to him. If you are a hardcore English folklore fan, then you'll probably love ROBIN HOOD!!!"
"Negative","Packed with info but abysmally written.: If ever a book cried out for a competent editor, this is the one. It's rife with misspellings, typos and incredibly obtuse prose. While it does fulfill its stated purpose of being a compendium of both classic and contemporary urban legends, it's an exhausting read because of its startling lack of polish. And if you find you're interested in learning whether or not a particular legend is true or even based in truth, I hope you're the patient type: the author often waits several pages before deciding to comment on the veracity of a story, sometimes saving up multiple stories and commenting on them collectively. That's when she chooses to weigh in on a tale's truthfulness at all, mind you. There are definitely better titles in this genre, not to mention the great Web sites covering the same territory."
"Negative","My sons did not like this music.: Not impressed with the Jonas Brothers. My kids talked me into getting the CD with another purchase so I could qualify for Free Super Saver Shipping and it was a waste of money."
"Negative","very disappointed: I made the order on Dec 13, 2009. The email said it will be shipped between Jan 2 - 7. It's so slow, but I think that may be due to the holiday season, I can understand and I can wait. However, today (Jan 9th) I got an email said ""We're still trying to obtain the following item. Still want it? We'll keep on trying. We'll cancel your order on February 07 2010, if we haven't located it by then."" Speechless... If you DO NOT have the product, please DO NOT list it on the website. Please DO NOT waste time for both of us. Thanks."
"Negative","Dreadful, bitter, jaded, vicious, and DULL: ""Agatha Raisin and the Curious Curate"" is unreadable. Every single character is vilely, vilely unsympathetic. I simply could not make myself care about this pack of shrews, snobs, bigots, and jerks. By page 50 I was hoping that the murderer was armed with a suitcase nuke. By page 60 I was so bored with the bitter harpy main character that I gave up.The stereotypes in this book are so broad (and so unrealistically awful) that I wonder if the writer was intending satire. If so, it doesn't work any better as a satire than it does as a mystery. Awful, dreadful book, and I cannot recommend it."
"Negative","bosch vs dewalt: Well dewalt is clearly better if you can have only one or two drivers in your tool box the chuck is ok- even the chucks on cheap drivers are ok. It is good for tight places, doesn,t have much power, probably as much as i'd expect from a 3.6 volt driver and the electric clutch is not as good to screw as mechanical clutches People will probably disagree with me, but I own and use 6 different drivers and that's my opinion. Not good for large screws, too weak, and the clutch adjustment is dismal if you are looking an accurate and consistent setting. I hope bosch works on improving these shortcomings so the tool can live up to the bosch reputation. For drilling ,don't waste your time."
"Positive","Great movie: This is an awesome movie. No complaints glad to have it in my library. John Wayne can't say more describes itself"
"Positive","BLUE: Works really well and doesnt fade out really fast. It's been three weeks since I've used it and it still hasn't faded at all. Would definetly use this brand again."
"Positive","To listen over and over!!!!!: If you want to improve your skills, this is a very good option!!If you don't have too much time to read, you put the cd while driving, for example, and you'll absorb the content.As Tom Hopkins say, believe and practice. It helps lot$$$$ !!!"
"Negative","DVP642 ""NO DISK"" fix: I owned DVP642 for less than a year and suddenly it stopped reading disks (""NO CD"" message). That happened after the player presumably overheated when operating under the hot sat receiver. I opened its case, spread some flux over all chips I could find on the decoder board (it's placed between CD reader and power supply board) and used a butane soldering iron till the solder melted. Now the unit works flawlessly. I guess many problems other than ""no disk"" could be cured with this method. Otherwise, I'm very satisfied with Philips DVP642."
"Negative","An U-turn in Candlemass's sound: If you like the old good sound of Candlemass (4 first albums), then you should have second thoughts about buying this one!"
"Positive","Deidre: I think that the book was very interesting. It has a lot of details that help you understand the book. I also like the ending."
"Positive","Buy these: These are great. They feel solid. No crevices for junk to hide. They look very nice. There are marks inside the larger cups showing increments for smaller measurements so you can us the 1cup for various different measurements. I love these as much as one can love a set of measuring cups. I'd buy again."
"Positive","Battery is better than expected: The delivery occured on schedule and in good condition. I charged the battery for 24 hours and then installed it in a Sony CR120E/R laptop (13"" screen). After 5 hours of Power Point presentations and data entry, which included the wireless being on for about 45 minutes, the battery had a 20% charge left. The screen brightness was set at 50% of normal. The battery totally met my needs."
"Positive","Awesome book: The book is a wide selection of delicate and touching fine black and white prints. It certainly adds volume to my ""artsy"" collection."
"Negative","really upsetting performance: I did a lot of research. Read all the customer reviews and decided to buy this product. It was utterly disappointing in performance. Except that it exudes steam and makes the floor wet... it does not clean well at all...it is the same as using a mop ....The only good thing i observed is to use it to clean upholstry. I am returning this product asap."
"Positive","Leadership Clues to the Wormhole for Church Leaders: Bill Easum has made several important contributions in this book that makes it well worth reading. First, he forces us to think in fuzzy terms about the future of leadership by suggesting that ahead of us are clues rather than rules.Second, he injects a strong element of postmodern thinking into the conversation that forces us to think in nonlinear terms. Third, he is clearly spiritual and Jesus-focused in his clues.Fourth, he has a handle on leadership from an individual perspective, a congregational perspective, and the denominational or larger Church perspective. Fifth, he challenges church leaders about their primary client. Do they serve the congregation, or do they serve Jesus?Sixth, he challenges the church at various levels to anticipate the kind of leadership that will be needed in the 21st century. Seventh, he has a clear focus on helping the church at various levels address the spiritual needs of 21st century preChristians."
"Negative","I thought that Monsenieur Musk by Dana was big BIG RIPP OFF: I used the real Monsenieur Musk by Houbigant in the early 1980's.....thie stuff that is now made by DANA using their old name is a JOKE...it lasts about 30 seconds and smell like crap...what a ripp off.I'm gonna call amazon and see if I can send it back and get my money back!!!feel like I was really ripped off!"
"Positive","Little Golden Book of Words: I looked all over for this book. I'm a volunteer in the first grade at my local elementary school. I will use this book with children who hear another language at home. I remembered reading it with my own children. It's still a great vocabulary builder."
"Positive","My All Time Favorite Book: This book is on my laptop and my Kindle and I read it over and over again. I dip in and out on a regular basis. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) is the best pure writer in my personal experience and while I read this book, I have to stop now and then and try to absorb what I just read. It makes me want to go there and the sweep of history is so visible in this book. I love the part where he says that once you have seen the landscapes, you understand why three of the world's great religions started there. I read this book over and over and recommend it every chance I get."
"Positive","Moon - Gackt: Everything this super talented Japanese pop star touches turns to gold. This album is no exception! If you're looking for great music from an artist with a library of CDs which all sound different from disc to disc, then Gackt is for you! He also has a couple of video discs which really don't need translating for the images to reach out and grab you. From all accounts, he's also an all around nice guy, too. What more can you ask for?"
"Negative","Great symphony- Low quality CD: An absolutely gorgeous symphony- especially if you like Mahler and Bruckner. I even had some suspicions that Mahler had ""borrowed"" a few themes from his mentally deranged friend Rott! Aside from the music itself, however, I was extremely disappointed by the CD recording from Arte Nova Classics (a subsidiary of BMG)The first disc was imperfect and skipped in several sections. Amazon was quite efficient in allowing me to return the damaged disc but the replacement they quickly sent, was no better. Still skipped in sections and had ""dead"" sections... I decided it was too much trouble to return it again. Maybe the recording session was flawed? I'll probably try to get this symphony on another label."
"Negative","Belgian (no way): Unless the description of a Belgian Waffle has changed, this is a very poor example. The thin small indentations made by this unit make it more closely resemble a grill marked pancake."
"Negative","Surprisingly Amateurish: I love R.E.M. and I particularly love the R.E.M. songs that were recorded under the I.R.S. label. However, this video collection is surprisingly amateurish and it is missing many of the great videos that R.E.M. made during this period. I think it is time for R.E.M. and I.R.S. to mend fences, remaster the work off of the first five and a half R.E.M. albums, and issue a complete and professional compilation of the videos from this period."
"Negative","Order another edition: WARNING - this edition ( billed as CreateSpace Publishers, copy says IAP Publishers, Los Vegas) is a poorly scanned copy - as far as i can tell - for page size type is oddly small, margins oddly large and type is crooked on page as though run through a scanner."
"Negative","LOOKS LIKE CHEAP BOOTLEG: SAVE YOUR MONEY, ORIGINAL VERSION,IN MONO,THE OUTTAKES VERY POOR PICTURE AND SOUND, THE SOUND AND FILM OF THE AFTER PARTY SEGMENT OF THE OUTTAKES ARE COMPLEAT IN THE ENDING CREDITS OF TTWII S.E.2001 RELEASE, YET WARNER CHOOSE TO CHOP UP THE SOUND UP HERE, WHAT A UNNESSARY RIP OFF."
"Negative","Doesn't even match a Happy Meal Toy: I bought this for my nephew, and never got to even fly it! I loaded the batteries, connected the charger, and that was it---the charger would not charge nor come off---D* near broke it in half trying! Can't wait to return that trash."
"Positive","Surprisingly palatable flavor (fuzzy navel): Does it really mix up lump free? Well, not without an immersion blender. The problem is the immersion blender creates a froth with an amazingly amoxicillin aftertaste. The scent is definitely reminiscent of amoxicillin as well. The warmer the water, the easier it dissolves, but the more pronounced the aftertaste becomes.My personal solution has been to mix with hot tap water and an immersion blender, followed by addition of some ice mixed to a slushy consistency; then gently stir in enough lukewarm water to bring it to a temperature you can comfortably just chug-down-and-get-it-over-with. The alternative, for an additional 150 calories or so is to dump in a container of Chobani greek yogurt with fruit and blend to the consistency of a ""smoothy""; the pomegranate and blueberry flavors mask the amoxicillin aftertaste best.Realistically, this is a flavor that can lived with day in, day out, without retching."
"Negative","Poor Sound, Microphone and Battery: When you start talking after 30 seconds starts to sound even with all its charge, the person on the other side hears an echo, and one must speak loud enough for you to listen"
"Negative","Most Dreadful: I own this book selection, I am most interested on Works written about relations between Middle Eastern Countries and the Western World. I myself am from the Middle East and find interest in that type of work. I believe that the author shows a biased opinion in the book. The author sounds pessimistic about the United States in relation to North Africa but does not back up the info provided with Intelligible expanations on the point of reference. I was not Content reading this book, therefore I did not enjoy it."
"Negative","Adequate , but overpriced and low quality: The Adorama iTTL flash cord works fine, but I was very disappointed in its quality of materials and workmanship...very cheap. Probably won't hold up. The spring-loaded lever that locks the hot shoe to the camera is especially cheapish and looks like it will easily break off. It protrudes dangerously, asking to be bent or broken. If you are expecting a Nikon-quality aftermarket accessory for your Nikon camera, this is not it."
"Positive","Great for Fixing Drop-down Attic Stairs' Door: Just as another reviewer did, I used it on the drop-down door of my attic stairs so that it will close all the way. Works perfect! (Ironically, I too live in Plano)"
"Positive","Bob's new slippers: Great!!! Perfect fit. Hard to find a size 15. Have them on now. Sturdy. Price was right. Very happy with my purchase."
"Negative","Boring and a bit kiddie porn: I don't know which version I saw, but question how much the translation really mattered since I doubt there were two pages of script in the whole 2 hr. movie. I found it slow and boring and provided no background or answers. It was impossible to tell how the two kids had a relationship other than from loneliness.The kiddie porn reference is because the pasty little boy is shirtless in about half of the movie and then there's the gratuitous shot of the girl's naked crotch which was totally unnecessary. Since she has a 12 year old body forever, no duh that she's going to look like a pubescent kid, a shot of her body wasn't necessary (although I'm sure it wasn't the actress' real body.....one would hope) and added nothing to the film."
"Positive","Caring for yourselg and your aging parents: A must read for the young generation, too bad it was not available when my parents were old. My daughter has raised some poignant ideas and questions , since she read this book. Give it to your children, they will appreciated later in your life."
"Negative","one of the worst books I've ever read: If you didn't see the ending to this story within the first 40 pages, you're in serious denial. This was the most contrived, laughably bad book I think I've read since Sweet Valley High. The stereotypes of the characters are sophomoric, and the storyline has been done, done, and redone. I read it like you watch an awful made-for-TV movie - it's so bad you can't tear yourself away. ugh."
"Positive","Love the good wife: Always a good show. The good wife is one of the best tv series along with homeland and dowton abbey."
"Negative","Do not buy this program!: This is, quite possibly, the worst piece of software I have ever owned. Not only is it full of bugs, tonight it started DELETING other programs on my hard drive. The other reviews are right on -- it has great potential, but it's not worth the hassle. To quote Monty Python, ""RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!"" from Pinnacle Studio 8 as fast as you can."
"Positive","Kitten ""kalamity"": Our kitten cleared our bathroom counter of a library book (into the commode)! Rather than pay the library the total cost of replacing the book, we ordered over Amazon. Got the book, finished reading it, and got it back to the library before the due date! Great service, great quality!"
"Positive","A heavy hitter: I'll keep this simple and to the point. The lens is bullet proof. It produces beautiful images even in low light situations and that's even hand held.Only one minor complaint, it's pretty heavy. I guess that's a small price to pay for beautiful photos and dependability. You get a bit of a work out, but who isn't in need of that."
"Negative","Watch your pricing!: Started to order this item at the listed price of $299. On checkout the price was $320 - plus $22 more for handling and shipping."
"Negative","What an Awfull Movie!: Im a huge fan of Horror (Just check out all my reveiws, nothing but horror!) but this movie is absolutley awfull. I dont know how but I watched the entire movie, I guess I kept waiting for it to get better but it didnt. The story makes no sense. The gore was horribly cheesey and the character of Norbert was so annoying, I really hated that character.I figured since this was being released with the Dimension Extreme Series, that it would be half-way decent (check out ""Automaton Transfusion"" and ""Diary of the Dead"") but it was straight garbage. Dont waste your time."
"Positive","Get Caught: I saw this movie ages ago at the video store, rented it, and was blown away. It's one of those films that reminds you never to cheat on your spouse! But like another reviewer said, the wife's son is so wicked that you can't help but blame him for the family's demise. The wife and lover happen into this affair naturally-- how could they resist?This chilling family picnic is the most memorable scene.This is a great indie film that reminds you not to act on every desire because there are prices to pay.One of the few 5 star films. If you see it, you'll agree how good it it. It is dumbfounding how a movie like this is so unheard of. I wonder what other films are out there that are awesome that I don't know about.(One False Move and Bound are two movies not a lot of people have seen that are excellent too!)"
"Positive","Awesome book, simple.: you can read all the OTHER reviews that give full details of everything they hated about this book, im just writing to inform you that the book was great. if your offended easily by original thoughts about the christian religion then NO this book isnt for you. if your looking for a different kind of james patterson suspense that crosses religious ideas and plays on social taboos this book is for you! Enjoy it for what it is, AWESOME"
"Positive","Menage a trois with humor!: Written from the male perspective and very funny! The poor man is befuddled by the arrangement set up by his wife, hounded into paranoia by an office colleague and generally lost as to how his life has unfolded to this point.Written tongue-in-cheek, but with some insight to the characters background, one feels sympathy and understanding for them all. The ending was almost slapstick and expected, but done with a wink and a nod.For a light and funny reading experience this book will fill the bill."
"Negative","Didn't really like it.: More about the author than horses, which might be fine, but bottom line the book did not move me.This is yet another book that arose from a creative writing course. It is not a creative work of fiction, but a recounting of a life story.I love horses, love horse books, but not this one."
"Positive","Good Workout Ideas: This book is not a technique book. It won't teach you how to swim. If you're looking for that - look elsewhere. On the opposite extreme, it is not a book for the elite competitive swimmer. It's purpose is not to shave a few tenths of a second from someones already elite times.This is a very good collection of swimming workouts for all levels of fitness swimmers. The book is divided into various levels and utilizes all the strokes. The author also incorporates all the swimming toys (fins, pull buoys, paddles, etc.)The workouts are very creative and enjoyable. I often take the book to the pool (in a nylon bag). This is one of the best workout books I've seen. I purchased it a few years ago and have used it constantly. Highly recommendedA suggestion for future editions: get rid of the part of the book that is not about the workouts and then print the book in a water proof format."
"Positive","non-delivery: I advised Amazon that I did not receive this package even though the documentation said it was delivered. Amazon said I have to check with my postoffice. My postoffice says I have to file a form, which I did. I am going to advise my credit card company that I will not pay the charge on the bill. I like the senseo coffee pods very much and the Dark Roast are hard to find at my grocery store. That's why I ordered them online.Susan Cohn"
"Negative","Not as good as the live performance video: The tracks were flat. I don't know where they pulled them from, but they didn't have anywhere the near the energy that I expected. I saw the videos of the same songs on a PBS special, so my expectations might have been too high."
"Negative","Not stable: I bought this product just over a year ago and found it to be somewhat painful on the face. The material is too hard on the face. I put a sock on the front brace, under my chin which allowed me to hang for more time. But, the device started ripping apart on me; first where the straps are sewed to the brace, then the straps themselves were ripped off from the entire device.Not sure I can get it repaired - but will try to contact the manufacturer...."
"Negative","More like a five-tissue jerker: The PAY IT FORWARD review rated ""most helpful"" calls this movie a ""five hanky tearjerker"" but most who cried probably did because they'd paid good money to see this corny crap. However, I did need five tissues watching Helen Hunt zipping around in skimpy bikini top after skimpy bikini top and hot bra after hot bra - who knew she had such a smokin' body?!I rate PAY IT FORWARD (a typo, probably, as they must have meant GAY IT FORWARD) two stars for Helen Hunts's tight torso and ample bosoms. That must be the reason Kevin Spacey signed on to do such a trite LIFETIME-level flick, as he gets to make out with her. (So much for the rumors about him.)"
"Positive","One of the BEST books on coaching: As a life coach this is THE book that I recommend for anyone interested in learning more about coaching. The authors' philosophy that the relationship between a coach and client is a designed alliance is powerful and well articulated throughout the book. Each chapter is packed with information, tools and examples on coaching from the co-active model. It's also one of the few books I keep on my bookshelf in my office and I refer to it often."
"Positive","Big Surprise: I have always loved Gaither music, but had NO idea Mark Lowryhad such a great voice and singing style. Always saw him ascomedian, period. Was I ever surprised. This CD is one I haveplayed at least a dozen times....so far!!I would love to order the DVD sometime down the road. Hisperformance is very enjoyable on the CD and would love towatch him in action!!"
"Negative","What are people smoking?: I am dismayed at what people think is good music nowadays. Forcing me to listen to this stuff would be my personal hell. Get some taste people."
"Positive","Would Recommend: This product works great on getting the fleas and eggs caught on the teeth of the comb. Only bad thing I found is on some of his shorter slicker hair (just as on the legs) it doesn't go down to the skin. But other than that I would definately recommend."
"Positive","Exactly what i wanted: Seriously, all I was looking for was a trimmer, NOT A SHAVER, I use a razor for that. This works perfectly to keep your beard at the right length. I personally don't have a thick beard, which is perfect as I am able to maintain that 5'clock shadow look pretty easily. Just like everyone else said, no lubricant needed, one charge seems to last forever! Easy to use, and great price."
"Positive","Pretty Comprehensive: The writer spent a lot of time researching and compiling and even updating material with newer research. A must have for those doing genealogy research in New Mexico!"
"Positive","A Sublime Experience!: This video is terrific. Insurance companies should reimburse you for it, especially if you work a high-stress job. It strengthens the body while releasing tension and actually relieving pain. The relaxation at the end is probably the most unwinding and soothing experience I have ever had. Also teaches excellent stretches and lower-back releases for runners and anyone who plays high-impact sports."
"Positive","Sharp little dictionary: While limited in vocabulary, this is a handy item to carry to class or while travelling. It's smaller than a pocket sized dictionary and allows faster look-ups. After you have thumbed several characters of the word you want, it offers you a list to choose from. If you enter a spelling that it finds no word for, it lists similar words to choose from. The definitions provide part of speech, gender of nouns, and idiomatic uses. The Puzzles feature does not offer puzzles to solve, but is an aid in solving crossword puzzles (names of popes and presidents for example). As a student of Spanish, I had hoped for a way of looking up verb conjugations, but no such luck. The battery so far has lasted a month with frequent use."
"Positive","A must read!: Lise Goett's flawlessly written poems describe other worlds yet powerfully lead you through these extraordinary places and people's lives by your own vulnerability and your own emotions. Her miraculous metaphors strike again and again at your core. I've read Waiting for the Paraclete three times and it's my number one gift to friends and family. Finally, a contemporary woman poet who gets it: sensuality, love, death, purpose, etc. An incredible tour de force- read it now."
"Positive","CLASSY & CLASSIC: My wife gave me a Burberry's gift set and it's now become my favorite scent.She didn't buy it on Amazon and paid nearly twice as much as it's advertised for here. I know where I'll be buying my Burberry's from now on.Everyone has different body chemistry so no cologne smells the same on everyone. However, I have received more compliments on this scent than on any I've ever worn."
"Negative","Skip it!: I bought this for my husband last holiday season and its already fallen apart. Four out of the six key pins have fallen out and cannot be put back in. The first ones fell out within a month or two of purchase. This is a bad product and I highly don't recommend it!"
"Positive","The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Dogs 2004: We enjoyed your book and found it had excellent graphics, however there were a few concerns. On pg 83, it states when suffering from heat exhaustion to ""bath the dog with cold water and especially drench its head"" if one were to do this it would send the animal into an immediate state of cardiac arrest in shock, a condition that no owner is equiped to deal with. I think that any veterinarian would agree, the best course of action would be to slowly cool the animal with tepid water and seek immediate emergency help. As well there is a section stating how much dogs like to eat chocolate but there is no mention to the fact of it being extremely toxic. On the plus side it is nice to see that you recommended that any injured dog should be muzzled as it may bite (something that the owner may not know)."
"Negative","All Jerry, All the Time: The Deliberate Intent 4-CD Collection II was a surprise. There was no Esther Hicks or Abraham, only a rote recitation by Jerry Hicks. He reads a series of ""games"" to practice improving personal intent and vibrations, and adds some brief lectures. He has a fine voice, but it lacks the expression, energy, and sense of attraction to draw listeners into a space of creativity, response, and commitment. He wants his share of the spotlight, but frankly, he's tedious."
"Positive","""Baby Boon"" speaks the truth: Whether parents want to admit it or not, ""Baby Boon"" gets to the heart of society's bias in favor of parents and children. Elinor Burkett has taken a lot of heat for daring to write this book, but to put it plainly: Somebody had to do it. I wish I did not identify so strongly with the childfree people mentioned in the book. I wish the book didn't seem as if it had lifted experiences straight from my life. It does. If Ms. Burkett is ""whining,"" then perhaps that is what childfree people need to do to make their voices, needs, and wishes heard and understood. I am pleased to see such well-written material addressing such touchy, often unpleasant subjects."
"Positive","The Raft: My daughter is 5 and loves this book, as do I. As we got to the last page, she said, ""Read it again!"" The illustrations are so beautiful and what a great way for children to see the beauty of nature. Another great thing about this book, is showing kids(and adults) that you don't need tv to have an amazing time."
"Positive","A Christmas Classic: I love this album...it is timeless. I bring it out every time the holidays are here. It brings out the joy of the holidays and brings out the meaning of the season again. It has many of the classics and there are some with a little pop that will get you up to dance and sing along. Thanks to The Carpenters for making such a beautiful holiday album that will forever be a part of my holiday music!"
"Positive","this cd is tha best: when i first bought this cd the only song i bought it for was ""where the party at?"" after listening to tha whole thing every song became my favorite. tha ballads kick and the fast songs are indredible its an awesome cd everyone should get it fa sho"
"Negative","Complicated, hard to follow, not a great workout either: I was very disappointed with this video. I'm always so busy trying to keep up with Karen's complex coreography, poor cuing and choppy sequences, that I don't get to enjoy the workout and get decent results. By the time I finally pick up a move, she adds on to it or moves on to the next thing. She is serious, boring and not much fun to work out with."
"Negative","A bit flimsy, works ok but not good value for the money: Not a very efficient solution if you need to wrap and unwrap your cords more frequently. It's just a long strip of Velcro, much longer than I actually need so most of the material is wasted and even gets in the way (as you have to wrap it around and around). This also makes it more time-consuming to wrap cables."
"Positive","Definitly an indoor flag.: Flag is of the highest quality you could expect when paying this price. Probably wouldn't last long as an outdoor flag. But works great for indoor use in my man cave."
"Negative","Eh.....: Full Collapse is decent for what it is, but not essential by any means. Thursday is perhaps the best of what has been dubbed the ""mainstremo"" movement, and while their brand of stream-lined emocore is a nice respite from the slew of bad Blink 182 rip-offs, it's nothing special either. Some melodic guitar riffs here, a screamed chorus there, repeat. If this is your thing, I'm sure you'll enjoy it; it's not god-awful by any stretch. But this just doesn't move me anymore. I'd suggest you buy yourself a Jawbox record; it lasts longer."
"Negative","If you have patience: The story is incredible. However, it is written very poorly and the author repeats things to many times."
"Positive","Bravo!: I am both a music major and a huge Mendelssohn fan, so recieving this was a real treat. The music is brilliant, the choreography is great, and overall it was a great performance. I love watching it."
"Negative","EXPENSIVE shipping: I am only giving this product such a low rating because of the shipping. The product costs $29.95, and shipping is $22.49 ... Doubling the cost!This is the product we used to flavor the popcorn in the movie theater I worked in during high school. I adore it."
"Negative","Be Natural Callus Eliminator - don't use!: PLEASE be careful using this product! I had a salon use this on my feet during a pedicure and they got some on the soft part of the bottom of my foot (right in the middle) and now I have cuts and burns all over the bottom of the foot. It was fine on my heels, but it caused cuts and burns on the side of my ankle and side of the foot as well. I wouldn't use it!"
"Negative","Think before buying this one...: The ""new"" planes were horrid. Several wouldn't work out of the box(Abacus finally put out a patch months later). I was unable to get the runway lights to work at Sky Ranch and Abacus was of no help!"
"Positive","Melissa and Doug for Imaginative Play: As a homeschooling mom of 7 I can authoritatively say that Melissa and Doug products are the best. So sturdy and durable but realistic at the same time. Read the book The Doll People (or listen on tape) while your little ones play. With these accessories my 3 littlest girls (6, 7 and 9) imagine that their dolls are real and play at night with all the of the food, plates, silverware, and use the lamps and toys. You can't go wrong with this company all around."
"Negative","poor design dont waste your money: i gave this a try but wasnt thinking clear..this is not what the pros use theirs isnt as restricted,this product would be better with the wheels fully exposed...dont bind your blade in the plastic or your knife is ruined quickly...i get a way sharper and more even egde useing a cheap carbide hand sharpener...ive been sharpening knives sense i was a kid and can shave with all of them except for the ones i gotta fix because of this machine...total waste of money"
"Negative","The only movie I ever wanted to walk out on: I'm sorry, but Joe Vs. the Volcano was just about the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't blame Tom Hanks or Meg Ryan, I just felt completely disappointed by the BAD SCRIPT! I hate to be a dissenting voice, but I have seen many movies, good and bad, and this one is the only one I actively loathe."
"Positive","Good CD: I saw this movie a few times Can't Fight The Moonlight is a good song and the other songs were good....I liked it, enjoy."
"Negative","string buzz: Lots of string buzz if you try to pop it on and start playing.You can get it to play without the strings buzzing, but not without some trial and error.Ditched this and bought a Kyser which works like a charm."
"Negative","Okay, I don't get it: The sound quality is certainly far from state of the art, even by 80's standards. And the songs and performance - well, I don't get it. Give me the Trio of Emmylou, Dolly and Linda over these gals any day of the week. Lots of hype, good looks, but not much else."
"Negative","Frequent disconnects. Bad quality control.: Do not buy this router. The quality is a hit or miss. And there have been quite a few misses now that cannot be ignored anymore. I just wished I read about this first.The router may suddenly fail to work and requires a reboot by unplugging it. This isn't ideal when you have it stuck in a location that is hard to reach. Running the latest .14 release of the firmware (6/2004) and still has the problem. For some it may occur once a month and for some every 30 mins. Please do not even consider this.If you are skeptical about these comments check out the forums in dslreports.com and search for 'post your BEFW11S4 issues'"
"Negative","Not Again: You think making the game 3 times for each system would be enough, but gamecube has to try to make more $."
"Negative","Not that great: I bought this for my 7 year old son and he played it for about 7 minutes before tossing it into the ""games he never plays"" box. Not only are most of the fighters out dated but it was hard for him to even figure out how to use 2 player mode, he thought it was 1 player only until I read the instructions on how to access the 2 player mode. He is usually very quick to pick up on how to play a game but this one was set up in a dumb manner. Also, the announcers are annoying and keep saying the same thing over and over. Even though it was very cheap it still was not even worth it."
"Negative","so bad its good: what absolute nonsense... the ""proofs"" she offers are so terrible they are laughable. the ""investigative journalism"" is so bad it makes weekly world news (a tabloid she sources in the film as proof) look like barbara walters by comparison.this is great to watch if you are high and want a good laugh, but if you take this crap at all seriously, you are going to be wasting your money."
"Negative","disappointed: I ordered this fully expecting it to be the FOLDER as it says. Instead all I got was the tiny book that comes INSIDE the folder, no outer cardboard folder with the plastic molded quarter holders. Now it's going to cost me more to order what I need and none of these descriptions seem to indicate what you really get."
"Negative","Quality going downhill: We have a 25 year old water pik and a 5 year old one in a different bathroom. Guess which one fails? The new one. Every time I turn it on, there's a 90% chance there'll just be a buzzing sound. If you bang it against the counter and suck on the hose while it's buzzing, the motor might start spinning (or it might not). then you can put the reservoir on and do your thing. Other than that major offense, it does what it's supposed to do."
"Positive","Not quite the title: This book on the cover seems to say that it will help you learn more HTML and CGI. It does show you some good code but I think this book is more of a reading book then a reference. In the beginning it tells you everything about the web you can think of. There is a lot of information that I did not know, but this book takes you where you have never been. I would recommend this book to the accomplished HTML person with medium CGI experience."
"Negative","I Wish I Could Give This a 0: Anyone who thinks that this movie has any basis in fact or any remnants of reality should read a few books. I recommend ""The Birth of Whiteness- Race and the Emergence of US Cinema"" by Daniel Bernardi for starters. Films like these only promote a blind ignorance of American history, one which contributes to the racism, bigotry, and nationalist superiority sentiments which are at the root of all our domestic and international troubles. This movie attempts to be a feel good film for anyone who has ever felt disenfranchised because of their race or economic status. If you fell for it, that's too bad."
"Negative","Frustration: Frustrating...my husband and I worked for hours to get this set up much to the disappointment of our five year old son.Pieces did not stay locked in placedirections were vague and difficult and skip stepsmaterials were flimsy and did not fit together wellWhile I was excited about the prospect of fun this toy could bring it came far from delivering.We returned this product"
"Positive","One of the decade's best: Gene Siskel was dead on when he named The Ice Storm the best film of 1997. It's visual style resonates, and the performances are wonderfully true.Ang Lee's camera is respectful... it is easy to imagine the exploitative qualities this film could've undertaken with a different director, but Lee is (smartly) tender towards his hurting subjects."
"Positive","They just keep banging it out of the park!: What else can I say? I love this show, I am so glad Jim Parsons got those Emmy's, he deserved them and if he keeps it up he'll deserve them for many years to come. Maybe they'll recognise that the show deserves one too! If you're wondering if you should buy this, all I have to ask is this, have you SEEN the first two seasons? Then what's wrong with you? Why haven't you bought this already!?"
"Positive","Mummies Are the Word: What a wonderful little book. Clear, smooth, natural prose, and wonderful drawings. We all love dinosaurs, but not many of us (okay, I'm probably the only one ignorant in this way)have even considered the idea of dinosaur mummies. Wish I'd had this book when I was a dino-nut kid, but my grandkids have it, and I'm happy for that."
"Negative","One size fits all cuff doesn't: This is a promising blood pressure monitor. The problem is that the cuff leads to multiple wrong readings. I've checked it multiple times against my blood pressure in my doctor's office and this is consistently wrong. I'm now looking for one that doesn't have one-size-fits all.And to correct Pajama Guy's review, it's not exported in an Access Database. It's exported in a comma-separated values (CSV) file."
"Negative","duped be description--NOT MADE IN USA: I purchased this item online with the belief that the description, including the words ""Made in USA"" were to be true. It is not. It is made in a country that currently trades with the U.S. and does not mind that high lead content and poor quality are a hallmark of their exports(never mind their workplace or human rights records!!!)I would send it back, but that would only throw good money after bad. Buyer beware, all descriptions are not the same and are not necessarily accurate...verify by phone first before you buy."
"Positive","enjoyable read: I liked this book and thought that, there should have been follow up stories about theromulan. (another seperate novel)solid read"
"Negative","Arthur Mythos: This is the worst rendition of an Arthurian mythos CD I have seen. I wouldn't recommend it, it was boring. The comedic tone really bogs it down."
"Negative","Total Junk: I own a set of the walnut tradition from Chicago Cutlery and have been very happy with them. I wanted something I could put through the dishwasher, so I ordered these, thinking the quality would be on par with my other knives.Mine didn't even make it to the dishwasher - all 8 that I ordered had cracked handles upon delivery. On top of that they were pretty dull - nothing like my walnut handled chicago cutlery knives...."
"Positive","Great water fountain,but fails in one area.: I have two Persians,which are long haired,and Ifind I have to clean the pump and replace thefilter every week,if I don't the water flow dropsto zero. This fountain was designed for a shorthair cat,but when it is cleaned my persians loveit. I still recommend this item because it pro-vides a fresh and cool water source."
"Positive","Clear, but CD no longer runs on Mac: Clearly written, easy to follow.If you have a Mac, though, the CD-ROM does not work with OS 10.7 (Lion) or above. The second edition is 10 years old, so that probably explains why."
"Negative","wow: I read this book and im 13 and i don't think i should have read beacuse the book was very graphic about killing ect. i would not recommend this book to anyone under 13. besides that the storyline was ok. I would only read this book on a rainy day.~*~shelby~*"
"Negative","inaccurate thermometer: I owned an insta-read thermometer from this company previously. It lasted four years and the circuitry died. The new one took 20 seconds to register the temperature of actively boiling water and gave the result as 204 degrees. I returned it immediately. I now own the $99 Thermapen. I was trying to avoid the price, but I need accuracy."
"Negative","pyle 2400watt amp: ok the first day i got it, it never worked the lights dont even come on and my friend does hook ups for a living and he said its something wrong on the inside"
"Negative","Anne is a redhead!!: Did anyone read the first page??? Anne is a redhead! This is insane! I'm so angry and very disappointed in you, Amazon. Whatever just-out-of-high-school little jerk you hired for this should be taken out back and shot!"
"Negative","Horrible and dangerous for kids!: How can anyone still feed this to children? I cannot believe that, given the medical research evidence about the dangers of artificial colors and flavors (of which Wacky Mac and the other Fould's prodcuts have several), anyone would give this to children. If you want a Kosher mac & cheese, make it from scratch (it is sooo easy) or buy this one instead, which is far healthier: [...]."
"Negative","Bored Silly: I could not even finish this book! It was so slow! Then there is the unbelievable safety precautions. 1. The FBI isnt going to pay for the men or the resources for this girl. 2. Dont you think that the average guy stuck on an elevator with a girl (that is talking in a little girl voice to another female not on the elevator) would wonder about what kind of psycho craziness is going on! I know I immediatly thought of the book Sybil. I am glad that I got this book free, otherwise I would be depressed!"
"Positive","overlooked and ahead of it's time.: Why is it that almost, if not all of Walter Schreifels' projects are so undoubtedly amazing and genius? Why is it that the best music 9 times out of 10 comes from New York? Why is it that Walter can never stick with one band long enough for people to catch on? I don't know the answers but I do know that 'United by Fate' is a work of sheer genius. Modern rock radio will never touch this album due to the lack of cookie cutter Nickelcreedpuddleofsalivadefault3doorswhatever appeal but maybe it was meant that way. Maybe the masses who would rather hear Kid Rock display his utter lack of talent and disgusting views on music shouldn't have the priviledge to hear such timeless and mindblowing material, nor would they probably even understand it. Regardless, ol' Walt knows what he's doing and we can only hope he continues to do so for years to come."
"Negative","Breaks too easily.: A wonderful device, BUT I've now used three of them before giving up. The general design is quite good. However, the suction cups at the end of the graber break or just fall off. They are good enough to pickup a dime but with continued use eventually they fall off. I tried jiffy-glue but the screws go into a plastic bushing, which fractures."
"Positive","Prog Rock for Deadheads: Certainly jazzier than most Yes offerings, Chris Squire's solo album from the mid-seventies has always been one of my favorite ""obscure"" albums. All the songs are incredibly listenable and feature the odd time signatures and impressionistic lyrics you will find with a lot of great Dead tunes. I love the jam at the end of ""Silently Falling""For $4.99 at amazon's mp3 store, it is certainly worth the price."
"Positive","AMAZING!!!: These boys have done it once again. Whith each album, they seem to be gettin better. They never dissapoint and always bring the classic material. From beginning to end this album is fire! They're consistency is unmatched. My favorites are Hard, Walked Outta Heaven, Whats it Like, I Don't Wanna, In The Morning, and SHady Girl.. This is a definate addition to your collection, a no brainer. Just pop it in and let it play from start to finish."
"Negative","Something is not right: I ordered the same model battery for my camera that I had already existing and when I tried to use the new one they shipped me, it was slightly larger than the old one. I did not notice this until I put the battery in, and it actually go stuck in the battery slot and it took a but of work to get it out. It was obviously not the same battery that came with the camera, even though it was labeled with the same model number. I requested a full refund and got it, but now I am stuck with a camera that does not work still and I am leaving on vacation tomorrow. It was not worth my time and I am left wondering where this seller is getting their product from to be honest."
"Negative","Much opinion, little substance: There are some good books about the astrological effects of Chiron. But this is one which goes long on opinion and short of substance. The author states opinion, and then grabs that opinion as fact, which she then goes on to explore in length. While there is a LOT of well written verbiage here, there is little of substance which one can take away. Her parameters for drawing opinions, posing as fact, seem to be too wide. If you want to read well written text, then use this book. But if you are looking for documented substance, look elsewhere. Sure, there are some 50 chart examples, but the interpretation of these examples is based on opinion. Where is the substance?"
"Positive","Workout guide for the motivated.: The book is a great guide for the motivated. It gives great inspiration for the long term, if you are motivatedd enough to stick with the program. Don't expect an overnight dramatic change. This book is geared to the person that is willing to work for the ideal body size and maintain what they worked so hard for. Should have added more exercises for the advanced levels and long term, but overall good book."
"Positive","It's the REAL thing!: Collectors and film historians alike know why this collection of Korngold film music is a veritable treasure. In the 1960's Warner's made the decision to destroy all the acetate production recordings of dialogue and music in their archives. Luckily, the composer's son,George Korngold, transfered the remaining optical tracks from the original Warner Bros. recording sessions to tape and preserved them in the family archive. Therefore, this collection consists of the only original recordings (apart from composite soundtracks) of Korngold conducting his own music! I think you'll agree...limited sound quality is a small price to pay for the joy of hearing the original scores conducted by the composer at work! Of course this collection is incomplete due to the fact not all the originals sessions were preserved. In fact it was derived from over 20 hours of tape. Love it for what it is...a treasure that was almost lost forever!"
"Positive","Great Product- It simply works: I've tried dozens of CD-RW drives. This one is simply the best I've used. I wanted to get an external drive so that I could use it on all of my computers. I was worried about finding one that was affordable and thought I'd have to go with Iomega and all of the driver problems they usually have. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the backpack product was available and competitively priced. It's the same price as an Iomega drive at best buy and the Iomega one doesn't have the parallel port interface. Also, it's worth noting that Amazon had the lowest price for the backpack drive. I checked about 10 retailers.Even better the software that's included will handle all of your CD writing needs. It's simple to use yet doesn't treat you like an idiot or give up function in favor of simplicity.If you're going to buy a CD RW this is the one to buy."
"Negative","Sloppy Story and Writing: This is easily the lousiest ""chic lit"" book I've read. The writing is bland and the characters are poorly fleshed out. More than once the author gets lazy and doesn't even bother to create a character herself but invokes a well-known character in pop culture and expects the reader to just insert that well-known character into her novel. For example, the main character is ""Sarah Jessica Parker, but prettier."" Her office mate is ""Lillith,"" from Cheers and the show Frazier.The main character is the least endearing of any I've seen in a ""chic lit"" book, which is a bad thing considering that so much of the pleasure of reading these novels hinges on the ride the main character takes the reader on. I would analyze the storyline for you but it's so weak I've nearly completely forgotten it already."
"Negative","An early Dick novel, and not a particularly successful one: Written in the early 1950s, this novel takes place in 1949 in post-revolutionary China and concerns three Americans, two men and a woman, who have remained to hand over control of a factory to the new government. One of the men, Carl, a boyish innocent, falls in love with the woman, Barbara, who is cold and emotionally repressed, and happens to be the ex-lover of Vern, the other man. The working out of this triangular situation is told rather tediously, with many flashbacks to minor incidents. The subplot of the political takeover of the factory is not well integrated with the romantic theme. Despite the vividness of some scenes, there is a meandering slackness to this novel, undoubtedly the weakest of Dick's mainstream works."
"Negative","Limited features and poor timepiece: I bought this watch hoping for a quality watch. Although I like its plain look (don't like any gold trim), it is not actually a good watch. Unlike a Seiko I have that was cheaper, it does not have a power reserve, so if you take the watch off overnight, it will stop. The Seiko will ""remember"" the time, even if the hands no longer turn, and once shaken, it will automatically move the hands to the correct time.The Mido also does not keep accurate time. It loses about 2 minutes each week. I don't think that is acceptable in a watch at this price. I don't recommend it."
"Positive","vile display of good music.....or is it?: Well, im a 'vile' is my first death metal album (bought it out of wonder) and i must say it is a great album. Even the simple opening to pucture wound massacre can't sway my virdict: for people who make fun of this opening, listen to the rest of the song. Plus, for people who are long time listeners to cannibal corpse: when you keep writing about the same thing over and over, it gets alittle boring, so when you look at 'vile's lyrics, just think that management was restructuring. Thats just my opinion, i could be wrong."
"Negative","I really hated this book: Apparently lots of people like this book judging from the other reviews below, but I found it incredibly shallow and tedious. It had a premise with a little bit of promise, but the juvenile characterization really put me off. The characters seemed like cardboard cutouts of fantasy archetypes to me. In addition, I often felt like most twelve-year-olds could have seen right through the shallow notions of good and evil Brin works with.Other people who enjoy lighthearted fantasy works may indeed enjoy this. I've enjoyed other fun works of fantasy like The Princess Bride, though I tend to prefer fantasy writers that are more serious, like Tolkein and Stephen R. Donaldson. I haven't read any of Brin's other works, so I don't know whether I have a problem with all of Brin's work, or just with this book in particular. In any case, you may agree more with the other reviewers and love this book, but I wanted to provide an alternate perspective."
"Negative","Too salty for consumption!: I love the White Cheddar Rounds, so I assumed that the White Cheddar Bars would taste the same. Not even close. The bars are so incredibly salty that I couldn't eat more than 2 bites. A complete waste of money."
"Negative","sunny chandler's return: Sorry. I like Sandra Brown, but this was all sexual inuendos and not much more. I skipped thru and tried to read more but I had not missed anything. It was the same. I very rarely do not finish a book, but I could not get into this one. And yes I will continue to read Sandra Brown unless this is going to be her style."
"Negative","Garage band sound: Come on. Bruce Palmer and Dewey Martin could be replaced in a second. Fact. Neil Young, Stephen Still and Richie Furay were the Buffalo Springfield. Its like going to a Steppenwolf concert without John Kay. There are members that carry the band and others that don't. Sorry my vote is this DVD is a rip off."
"Positive","Colorful puzzle: My 3.5 year old daughter loves doing puzzles. She was doing 48 piece puzzles and I realized she is ready for a little bit more challenging ones. So, I found these 60 piece puzzles and got a couple of them for her. She loves them. I am happy to find many non-princess themed, still attractive-for-girls kind of puzzles from this company. I think I will buy some more pretty soon."
"Negative","Flame Out: It would be a nice torch if it would light and stay lit. The only way this torch would light was to hold the tip close to a non-combustable surface & push the light button. As soon as it was moved away from the lighting position the torch would go out. Returned product & went back to more expensive and reliable Bernzomatic. Reliability trumps expense every time."
"Positive","Remington WPG250A Trim & Shape Grooming Kit for Women: It's an amazing little tool. I use it to shave my legs, tweeze eyebrows, trim stray hair around my neck and ears, and my bikini line. I love this product."
"Negative","NO SCREEN DISPLAY: THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT SCROLL AS DISPLAY ON TV/MONITOR.....THE CDIS STRICTLY ""AUDIO"".I THINK THE DESCRIPTION OR PICTURE DOES NOTREALLY CLEARLY STATE THAT THIS IS JUST A CD YOU CAN SING ALONG TOO...ORNOT A CD+G KARAOKE DISC."
"Negative","Overrated underperformer: I have owned several bread machines and this one is simply not worth the money. The mixing system does not work well, so you always have to babysit it or risk having an uneven loaf that is wet in the middle with dry ingredients stuck in the corners.When I called the manufacturer to complain, they were completely unhelpful.The 110 preprogrammed settings are mostly useless."
"Positive","Great value: I have had this monitor for several months now with no problems. The picture quality is great although not as good as my previous 17"" CRT. It is nice to have the speakers integrated into the display. I was hoping to get rid of my desktop speakers, but the sound quality is just not the same, so I may go back. The volume control is through a menu and not a knob, so it is a little more difficult to control.It frees up a lot of desk space. You may have to fool around with the display controls to get the quality you prefer. It was truly plug and play.Prosgreat priceplug and playintegrated speakersConsSpeaker qualityvolume control"
"Positive","easy Chinese cooking: These NOH spice packs make Chinese cooking easy. The char siu kit tastes pretty good, too. The Amazon price is too expensive, though. These costs a dollar each at my local grocery store."
"Negative","cheap price and cheap sound: dont buy this, it's a cheap product at low price for who dont apreciate the good sound of music."
"Positive","Cowboys & Aliens: If you need a few minutes to get away from it all this flick will do it. The film does have some story. It's presented with good camera and special effects. I'll be watching it again."
"Positive","Let's Have It on DVD Please: I saw this movie many years ago on late night TV and it made an indelible impression. Later tracked down the book by former actor, Tom Tryon. A fine piece of atmospheric rural horror. Creepy as hell, with some great unsentimental twists. Director Robert Mulligan served the story well. Love to compare my memory with an up to date viewing. Let's have it on DVD one day soon please. I'm afraid VHS is a sunset (or sundown) technology at our place."
"Negative","Good concept, but doesn't work well: My son who is four really wanted this toy, as he loves to bowl; this toy has a great concept, but it doesn't work well. He had to get right up to the pins, (3 inches away)and slam them in order to knock them over. Almost all of us tried it. It is almost impossible to knock the pins over. The balls are very small and light, but I don't think that was it, he practically had to hit the pins with his hands in order for it to work. Even another ball didn't work well. Wish the pins went up better. We bought ""Silly Pins"" and that is a hit. Very funny, very do-able."
"Negative","Before buying this game go to the game website and verify it is the correct video card as only 10 video cards work!: Well my pc is about 1 1/2 years old and can play any game until this one! I have all the requirements even the upgraded video card. I was able to download, but then when I try to open the game it goes from a black screen and then back to my desktop. I checked the website for the game [...] and only about 10 video cards are listed that work many upgraded video cards don't even work and they have them listed there so just because you have the necessary requirements to play doesn't mean you are going to be able to. I'm out $20 hope no one else has to be!"
"Positive","Can U Answer the Call to SELF?: Many are called to be resurrected/raised to their former glory, but only a few will choose to answer the call. Books such as these should be a home-based repository for our children after coming home from modern societal school.Afrikans, spend your money on books, books and more books!!! Build your very own library of the Afrikan-story. If we cannot make the one-way trip back to the mother-country, then atleast go there mentally and permanently."
"Positive","Low Price, High Quality: When I was looking for a web cam, I wasn't quite sure what to look for. I knew I didn't want to spend a lot, but wanted something that worked well. Amazinly enough, this is the perfect buy. Inexpensive and so far, has outshown any other high priced cams that I have seen. Would highly recommend it (as I have already)!"
"Positive","Michael's Review: Gods and Generals by Jeff Shaara is an exciting adventure of the Confederate and Union armies during the Civil War. Each chapter moves a to new General for either side. This wonderful, informal novel shows mainly the defense and attacking strategies of both armies. General Robert E. Lee of the Confederate Army is the main character that it talks about and whose scenarios are mentioned the most in this historic novel. He takes the Confederate Army from poor to excellent enough to defeat the Union on numerous occasions. This book is one of the best books I have ever read and I say that whoever is into the action involved with the Civil War and crucial moments and decisions should read this book."
"Positive","Sonin water alarm: This is my second purchase of this item.The first time was 15 years ago.It has lasted that long.We use it to tell us when water is coming in our basement whenever our sump pump malfunctions.It has a very loud alarm which wakes me up in the middle of the night even in the basement on the other end of my Ranch house.I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with water problems in their basements!!!!"
"Positive","almost perfect: my dogs have always loved this toy. unfortunately, it is now softer plastic which allows them to bite through and break off fragments they can eat. this is not safe for chewy dogs."
"Negative","Nice Read - Not As Described: I have read the other two reviews and only agree with the first reviewer. I have been flying for 28 years as both a recreational pilot and a professional commercial airline pilot. I expected this book to be a guide and full of practical advise for my son who is in the middle of his career as a pilot. It is not. It is seriously over priced and over hyped. I agree there are much better books out there for advice and instruction. Do yourself a favor and try to get this from the library if you want to read it, do not spend the money."
"Negative","Not that good: I gave my dog this ball and chased him around the house with it for about 5 minutes. Then I took a break and got something to eat and came back and it was torn up and pieces of it were laying on the floor. The reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 is because my dog has also ripped through the tiger tested toys that Kong has so it just might be that my dog has very sharp teeth!"
"Negative","idog - don't buy: It is very cute - but after a few minutes - the thrill is gone. The ""dog"" makes the same sounds - gestures over and over - and then getting him to turn off is quite a task!"
"Positive","I love kelly!!!: I thought that this CD is a worthwile investment for it has all the great song of your singers packed into one CD. Definanetley a good CD to buy"
"Positive","Jump in and savor!: For all Richard Thompson fans this is a real treat. The vocals by Judith Owen and Debra Dobkin are great. Excellent all around!"
"Positive","A great hard rock album dark&edgey: Well I wouldint put this nessiarily in the nu-metal genre persea.Actuly this is more hard rock than nu-metal. Altogh It doesnthave quite as much as the mellowness of break the cycle, stillit's one of those hard rockin cds that you can just listen toall the time. But don't be discuraged that it only has 9 songs.it has a secret track if you fast forward 15 minutes from song#9, another acoustic ballad by arron lewis. Now to the cd thereare some very notible songs on here. like just go,me, mudshovel,home."
"Positive","Excellent: This book is very detailed. Although I've done some stamping, etc; I've just started getting involved with cards and this is a very good book for beginners and there is a listing in the back where products can be purchased. One of the things I've found most frustrating is trying to find the materials for the cards, etc."
"Negative","Shipped item no where near the photo product description: The plant that arrived was a full 1/3 to 1/4 the size of the plant used in the photo used to market this plant. The photo was the factor used in deciding to purchase from this vendor versus others. I will not likely purchase from this vendor again."
"Negative","like sleeping on plastic!: I bought this because i wanted to keep my mattress clean and also because I am allergic to dust mites. Sleeping on this made me feel hot like I was sleeping on a plastic sheet and even worse this product can not protect against dust mites because it does not go all around the mattress like a zippered cover does.This product does not meet its claims, try a different one."
"Negative","Strictly by-the-numbers covers album: Ms. Estefan sings a collection of oldies here, and NONE of them have anything unique to offer in the way of clever arrangements or an individual point of view. ""Cherchez La Femme"", the great song originally recorded by Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, is virtually identical, minus the pizzaz and sass. It is transformed into a bland vehicle for Estefan. Ditto ""Turn The Beat Around"". What is the point of copying the original musical and vocal arrangements so closely that it renders the remake utterly pointless? Why listen to these cheezy remakes when the originals are the real deal? Keep these questions in mind, and before you invest in this hollow exercise, seek out the originals, and leave this empty collection alone."
"Positive","Nice variety of episodes.: This is a really nice collection of Wonder Pets episodes. They're well-crafted, short and sweet adventures with wonderful songs and REAL music. Our 2 year old son loves watching and singing along. We don't have cable or satellite at our house so we get our Wonder Pets fix by dvd. I especially like the number of different episodes for the price. Our favorite one on this dvd is ""Save the Fiddler Crab on the Roof"" but they're all good. The ""Join the Circus"" episodes is much longer than the rest. (And good for your toddler to watch while you're trying to get something accomplished - without his help :))"
"Positive","Best Coca Tea I've found: Tea is CLOSE to what I had in South America. I also like that the tea bags themselves are unbleached. I would encourage anyone to try it that is interested in Coca Tea. DO NOT try ordering out of South America, I did and it was a NIGHTMARE: I only order through Amazon and have had no problems receiving my orders."
"Positive","Great grill cover for the price.: You really can't beat this grill cover for the price. It's pretty basic and standard, even a little boring, but it does the job of protecting my stainless grill that sits out in the backyard all day and night. The cool part is that it has velcro tabs on each end so you can cinch it and keep it nice and clean looking."
"Positive","The Wonderful Wild One: This book was a hit to all ages. It was a very good start for the Phantom Stallion set. I am looking forward to reading all the books. Good job to Terri Farley for writing these wonderful books. The Wild One is a good story for everyone to read."
"Negative","Hard to install even with same brand components: It says in the quick install guide to just plug the unit. No configuration is needed if you are networking with other d-link products. Sorry but it's not that simple.I spent the last 3 hours trying to configure it and still not works. The AP Manager don't recognize it and when configuring it manual, the MAC number gives me problems.Right know I'm writting to d-link support for advice. :( I just wish the installation could be easier."
"Positive","Luxury lemon: This is the most delicious lemon juice I've ever tasted. It has a fresh, crisp sweetness that other brands lack. A generous squirt of it makes ice water taste almost like lemonade. Or add it to green tea, hot or cold. This is a high-quality product at a reasonable price."
"Positive","More than 5 stars!: This is a favorite of mine, all the info about the Fin du siecle, Rudolph, and why we went into World War 1, and why some young people don't make it somehow!Amazing and amazingly entertaining book, very very higly recommended. I dont have anything to add to the info of the book itself, go for the editorial reviews."
"Positive","Awesome!: I don't enjoy rap or hip-hop much. And I don't know that I'd categorize Toby's music as either. But it does have elements of both. Regardless, this music is awesome! Perhaps I don't like hip-hop music because all of the other groups are so nasty and/or not talented. Toby's music is always edgy, fresh, and bridges the age gap. I am closer to 40 than 15 and I get as excited about Toby's music as my 18 year old brother does. This album, as with all of Toby's albums, does not disappoint. Toby is probably the single best solo artist in the Christian rock world. Great music! Great message! Love it!"
"Negative","LiDE 50 on Linux a no go: If you plan to use the Canon CanoScan LiDE 50 on Linux, you're currently out of luck. Of the LiDE scanners, the Sane (Scanner Access Now Easy - http://www.sane-project.org/) project only supports the LiDE 20 and 30. That's why only 3 stars.BTW, though this is labeled as a USB 2.0 product, it also works with USB 1.1."
"Positive","Sing-a-long SFA: It's been a really long time... I cannot even remember the last CD I sung along to ;) But this one just cannot get out of my Bose CD system (installed in my 350HP S4...Just bragging').I play it when I go to work in the morning and when I come back home in the evening, it almost covers the growls and hisses of my engine... Sheeee's a gooooolden retriever!"
"Negative","Save your money....: I didn't enjoy this book at all. I can usually find at least one thing I like about a book, but when you don't care much for the main character in the book it is hard to do. The main character was not likeable - she was very immature - she acts like a child and plays ""games."" A very disappointing read indeed.I was looking for a Christian Chick-lit book and I don't think this books fits that category."
"Negative","Expensive/ & noisy...: I found the tumbler to be very expensive for a loud tiny motor w/ a rubber container that you place on the rollers to spin the tumbler... It is very noisy... it takes 30 days of continuous tumbling to get results... I had to put the mechanism in another building on the property because you have to run it so much... it is loud!!! And the rubber smells from the constant friction...I would suggest researching other products..."
"Negative","Not well built or worth the price: This is not as easy as it looks on tv. Thats fine and I dont mind the challenge. However, the motion is not as smooth as they make it seem on tv. Im pretty coordinated and dont have difficulty find a rhythm but the motion seems jerky and like it sticks. I oiled the places it suggestied in the guidbook but I dont think it helped at all. It definitely doesnt look or feel like it would hold up to daily use for even a few months. SAVE YOUR MONEY! I saw a lot of negative reviews about customer service however I havent dealt with them so my review is soley based on the product."
"Negative","DVD-R????: Pixelates and skips from the get go. Unplayable on two dvd players and three computers. Great movie. Unfortunately this burn on demand DVD-R is a worthless release.Take your chance, roll the dice or better still wait for a pressed disk release..."
"Positive","Guilty of being White: An absolute must purchase from this trailblazing hardcore band. Minor Threat sound just as aggressive and powerful today as they did back in the early 80's, and this outstanding release captures all of it, all the bands fierce material on one CD. From such classics as 'Guilty Of Being White' to the awesome 'Look Back' And Laugh', this is one release no self-respecting punk should be without."
"Negative","If it's broke, ya gotta fix it!: The snowblower I ordered from Amazon/tru-value was shipped in a timely manner but was damaged. The shipping box was in good condition, but one wheel was damaged. Repeated calls to Amazon have not resulted in the problem being fixed. It is the first bad experience with Amazon, but beware!"
"Positive","Superb Quality & sound - the best money you'll spend: I can't be more pleased with these. I purchased teh Logitech ones last year but it was clunky and the plastic headphone piece soon broke. These are a little wobbly but I'm just so impressed overall and these are priceless. Give yourself a treat and enjoy!"
"Negative","I may be a Goy but I am not a smuck: I had to counter the deep thinkers that have some how analyzed this totally plot less wanderings to be worthy of comment. After reading one review that claimed this travesty to art was ""witty and engaging (containing) lessons (that)are true and wise (and we should )Be ready for a little action, a few contemplative chuckles, and a lot of food for thought"". I can only say, finish your Tom and Jerry comic and get a book with words."
"Negative","dc sunglasses: i was very dissapointed in these glasses, they look and feel cheap.on the inside arm it reads""china"" and scrapes off! very bad!!!"
"Positive","great vacuum: This is a great vacuum for a great price! it ""sucks"", literally! it got a lot of dust out that my old cheapy bissell ""sweeper"" has left behind.the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the foot pedal is really tricky to deal with and seems that it might also be easy to break because of the stiffness. but i'm hoping that it will get better with more use."
"Positive","Excellent, can't wait for 2nd CD to become available.: All eleven tracks rate between good and great. The crowd sound may be a little overdone but it lends atmosphere and the artists & lyrics more than make up for any slight irritation. This CD is bound to become one of my more frequently played CD's, like Lullabys Legends & Lies."
"Positive","Dusty but better (and cheaper!): This product produces lots of dust, so keep your face away and pour slowly, but our cats seem to like it better, and it clumps SO WELL. Plus, it's cheaper."
"Negative","Disappointed: I was looking for a less expensive solution for holding a white board. Unfortunately, this easel is so flimsy that I will likely need to purchase a different type."
"Positive","The Good Stuff: This is a great feed for all birds. I have a super picky cockatiel and he won't touch any other kibble. Conversion was easy and my bird is going strong. Highly recommended."
"Positive","The Cat Who Should Not Have Left Moose County: An avid fan of the Cat Who series I found this installation boring! The cats, Koko and Yum Yum, and their human, Qwilleran, are always entertaining but this time the storyline was lacking. Maybe the absence of Moose County residents is the reason. We've come to know these folks and they were missing from this adventure. The story takes place on Breakfast Island, the newest 'in' spot. There, Qwill meets and makes new friends but the story just doesn't click. I was much happier to discover our trio of detectives stays home for their next adventure. Meow"
"Negative","bad: the powershot s50 will not turn on anymore sinse the siding lens cover wonnt work right and canon wants 139.00 to fix !!! Im never buying a canon camera agine!!!"
"Positive","A Bit Mixed Up: It was refreshing that this book was not so extreme as the ""Natures First Law"" book, of which Steve Arlin is a co-author. However, this book is not sure what it wants to be. Is it a recipe book? Is it a tips-for-eating-raw book? Is it a bodybuilding book? I think the book tries to be all these things, but unfortunately, with such a short length, it can't possibly achieve this. That said, there are some positive aspects to this book, and I'm glad I read it. I would recommend this book to someone who has already read several other raw-food-related books, and is seeking more information. The author does share some good insights and tips on eating a raw diet. He has been raw for several years, and he does have some good stuff to share. His wife also provides a lot of great recipes (but why is she not credited on the cover of the book?). If you're looking for an exercise program or information specific to body building techniques, you are not going to find much of that here."
"Negative","A terrible disappointment: I was really disappointed after reading this book. I bought it expecting to have a romance, but it wasn't even! The author constantly made the heroine, Sabrina, sound desperate, skinny and very frail. And the hero, Phillip, proposed marriage to her in the beginning and them slept with his mistress on their wedding night! And to make matters even worse, she forgave him without a second thought. How this book came from the same author of ""Rebel Bride,"" which I loved, is beyond me."
"Positive","Works great with my mobile phone: It is nice to have some extended memory in my mobile phone. It works great. The only thing that I am disappointed about it is that the adapter does not fit into any of my computers card reader, and that is what I was shooting for when I got the memory with the adapter. But all in all it is a great product!!"
"Negative","Beware: 8 oz only!!!: The weight of this product was not specified by the seller and the picture is too blurry to see the details. The product description says 10+ oz, but it's only shipping weight. The actual bottle you get is only 8 oz.I was very disappointed when the product arrived and saw the tiny little bottle. Won't purchase this item again."
"Positive","Great Movie from a Beautiful City: I really enjoyed this film and I do not generally enjoy subtitled movies. The characters were believable and I enjoyed watching the relationship between Mehmet and Francesco slowly develop into a physical and emotional bond. The only reason I did not give this film a 5-star rating is because I disliked the ending. I felt that it's message was one about the hopelessness and futility of gay life and that it has no serious future. This is simply untrue. There was no need to make the wife into the type of character she became. Great scenery and a rich introduction into Turkish culture and family life."
"Positive","Great Sci-fi film! A must see for Olivier Gruner fans!: Automatic is an excellent film! It has a futuristic plot & a twist at the end. Loved it! Not to mention, Olivier Gruner is so handsome and has a very likeable character. He's very protective. I bought this film as soon as I found it on amazon; too bad it isn't available on DVD, at least not that I could find.Anyway, I highly recommend it!"
"Negative","Awful, broke the first day: I tried to reposition a section to add 2 sections and it broke; now, because of the male/female hook-ups, I am only able to use it with the same amount of sections as it came, with one broken and the other un-usable."
"Negative","Worst Movie Ever!!! (Negative 1 million stars): This is the worst movie that I have ever seen. I wish I could get the 73 mins that I wasted watching this crap. The storyline, acting, grammar, still shots of Vegas, everything about it was horrible. Recommending this movie to anyone would be a cruel and unfair punishment."
"Positive","Startling and engrossing, insightful and haunting: Watson draws us in with a simple and honest tale of life in rural Montana, then throws a curve which explodes the idyllic myth and draws the reader breathlessly through to its conclusion. Reminiscient of David Guterson or Jane Smiley, Watson reveals the hidden depths under the seemingly simplest lives and the multiples layers flowing through society and history. His voice is clear, his vision haunting even a year after its reading"
"Positive","works as intended: purchased 2 of these to hold my speedlites (580EXII and 285HV)on stands.I was originally using the plastic foot that came w the 580EXII, but had issues with the flashes slipping out.The red knob is a bit small, however it and the metal bracket work well enough to tighten so I no longer worry about speedlites coming loose.If I were to purchase replacements or additional units, I would look for:1.non plastic knob2.larger knob.3.possibly knob 1/4"" further out from bracket for easier adjustment w speedlites on top."
"Positive","Wow: I have been very disappointed with the HD video side of many movies, sometimes it's hard to tell the diff between HD and a good upscaled DVD.Not with this HD DVD, the video is is breathtakingly good and the audio a match.If you love the Eagles, you will enjoy them much more in HD."
"Negative","Waste of Money: Too many mistakes. As for the Cram Sheet not even worth looking at. Total waste of time & money. DO NOT USE FOR EXAM."
"Negative","Not one size fits all: The Wellgate For Women Gel Comfort Knee Support, 1 size is not for all. I read reviews before ordering but after receiving this item, if you are a larger woman don't depend on this to fit. I read where smaller women were having problems because it was to large for them. I'm sure it works for some women that are in the middle of small and large it fits perfectly. Not happy with it."
"Negative","does not work on non US ps3: this bundle though a great value is not region free. does not work on my PS3. there should be mention of blu rays that are not region free."
"Negative","disappointeeeeeddddd !!!!!!: Quite simple : want one was and still is great, in spite of the sometimes irritating vocal style of R.W.; but want 2 is simply tthe leftovers of the first with the bulk of the CD comoposed of overproduced, too long and simply boring songs. only the art teacher matches the first one. Don't buy !!!!"
"Negative","Studio techniques is too shallow!: After reading some of the instructional texts on Photoshop after I bought this book, I found that as much as Ben Willmore claims that he did not want to write a ""Step by Step"" approach, the book is way too thin on the inner workings of Photoshop 5 to be of any real value. There are better texts out there that teach more of what's going on in the program. Plus, the include CD is useless ( nothing there to follow along with the sparse examples throught the book.)"
"Positive","A cross between Star Wars and Mad Max.: This is one of my favorite movies. I watched this way back, and I later bought the tape when the price was $25 and considered it a great value. I still watch that movie once in a while. It's high adventure and an all together great movie."
"Positive","Like it, still getting the hang of it: This is our first GPS and so far we really like it. My husband and I did our homework and this model (although discontinued) had the best ratings with Consumer Reports for this price range. We plan to take it on our first road trip next weekend then I think we'll have a good handle on it but so far it's been great. Only problem we had was loading the new map that came with it, I still don't think my husband has gotten it and he knows computers well. There's an issue with that, but still the older map that's preloaded is great. The bluetooth that connects to your cell phone is really cool too. You can search on the GPS for a location , once it's found you can call the place your going to and speak to them thru the speaker phone on the GPS. Handy and simple. I would definetly suggest this to a friend."
"Positive","Great Product: thank you it is the perfect gift Excellent quality and great priceHave not viewed it...but sure the blue ray way will be great.."
"Positive","A Must-read!: This book is incredible! I first read it from the library, but then found I had to have my own copy. It features recipes, interviews with White House staff, and much, much more! A highly recomended book!"
"Negative","Another dust collector: I was so excited to be able to use a headset while working from home. No such luck...I received several complaints from callers on the other end that could not hear me. I tried every adjustment I could think of, including adjusting my phone and holding the mouthpiece directly on my mouth. Sadly, this one made it to my pile of unusable products shortly after receiving it."
"Positive","""Down To The Bone"" seen live in Charlotte N.C. What a nite!: ""Down To The Bone"" This is no doubt this best jazz group on tour in the U.S. If you get a chance to see them preform Go! This is one jazz group thats going to the top. A nite you want forget. ""Not bad for a bunch of white boys"""
"Negative","Fun for the cats: The cats have a ball with these, but they're definitely not high quality, but you get what you pay for. I received a pack of 2 and one of them didn't work. The company I ordered them from promptly sent a replacement though. All in all, a pretty good value for the money."
"Positive","Surprisingly Wonderful!: This book is an excellent finale to the Sailor Moon series. This manga has lovely artwork and has a sad yet beautiful story that anyone would love to read! The end of this book concludes the whole series with the marriage of Bunny and Darien."
"Negative","Cannot play U.K. movies in U.S.: I sure wish I had known that if you order a movie from the U.K. that I cannot play in on my D.V.D. player in the U.S. I sure wish Amazon had told me that before I bought the movie. Please let us know about that before we buy the movie. Thank You."
"Positive","A MUST-READ if you have now, had in the past or hope never to get cancer!: This is one of the best books I've read on the subject of NATURAL alternatives for cancer management and treatment. It is easily understood and well-laid out. Dr. Blaylock makes suggestions for how to proceed more effectively if you are going to go the ""traditional"" treatment path and he also provides excellent information for going forward naturally. He also helps you to understand how to decrease your likelihood of getting cancer in the first place and what the best options are to keep it from returning once you've had it. He provides a good overview of both sides of treatment options (natural/traditional). This is an EXCELLENT SOURCE of information for those seeking wisdom on this subject."
"Negative","Skip This: This movie is almost unwatchable. It's like Saving Private Ryan crashed into Black Beauty and all the good parts were destroyed.The first act seems to be written for 4 year olds. The script is so sickly sweet it gave me a headache and Director Steven Spielberg seems to have pulled the characters fro the book ""Cliche English characters for dummies"". Once the story moved onto the battlefield the movie makers seemed to give up on the dialogue altogether and we got endless beauty/heroic shots of the horse and main character. This part seems to have been produced with the sole object of making 9 year old girls cry. I can't review the end of the movie because with less than 20 minutes to go I gave up and stopped watching. This shouldn't matter really, because even though I'm a fan of some of Spielbergs' work he very rarely knows how to end his movies.Even worse than War of the Worlds. Don't waste your money."
"Negative","""Whisper His Name"" is not up to Thornton's other books.: I used to say, ""I'll read anything written by Elizabeth Thornton."" However, ""Whisper His Name"" was a total disappointment. I couldn't make it past Page 99, and even that was an effort."
"Negative","Ehh.. only alright: This game is slow to load, and it takes you through to many screens before you can just play. the games are good though, I wish they cut out a lot of the fluff... The award ceremonies take forever..."
"Positive","Wow!: Karen Kingsbury has a way of telling you a story that teaches serious life lessons. This is a good book!!"
"Negative","Adobe FramaMaker 7.0 Classroom in a book: The disk that accompanies the book is inaccurate. It made doing the lessons very confusing. I finally had to contact Adobe Press to find out why the lessons and the sample files didn't work as mentioned in the book. They said the disk had errors, they would send me a replacement. But I'm still waiting... it has been over two week since they said they would send a replacement.And of course like the series of books of the Classroom in a book... it isn't very detailed especially on authoring structured FrameMaker."
"Negative","This movie is BAD.: Golf Punks originally premiered on the Fox Family Channel. The web page says it's rated PG-13, though. I don't know if that's a mistake or not; maybe they had to take things out to play it on TV. Anyways, I'll probably buy this when the price drops because I want to get all Lampoon films on video, but unless you already saw this and liked it, I don't recommend it. See Men In White instead, which is better, and I hope will come to video too."
"Negative","Limited scope: Got a subscription for one free year when I subscribed to another magazine. If you're into sportbikes it's fine. If you're a cruiser rider you're all but forgotten."
"Negative","Easily fugazi's worst.: I forgot how bad this album was until I popped it into my CD player the other day.It seems like every song has one or two parts that are totally killer, followed by 3-4 minutes of boredom. The song ""Epic Problem"" is good throughout, and Full Disclosure is EXCELLENT except for the horrible screamed verses. Strangelight is awesome too, and not very typical of Fugazi. The Kill is also good in the same way, it's very chilled out. Past these few standout tracks(which wouldn't be standouts at all on any other album of theirs) there isn't much reason to listen to the album. It's incredibly boring.I suggest picking up any other fugazi album first, maybe 13 songs, red medicine or in on the kill taker."
"Negative","Dolby-B on CD: OK. I like YES. When I started hearing their new song ""Lightning Strikes"" all over the radio, I had to get the album: it's a great tune.But when I popped the CD in and started listening to this brand new album, my horror and dissapointement were accute. Listening to this FLAT sound reminded me of the days of cassette tapes and Dolby Noise Reduction slicing the top half off every song.I actually thought my stereo was hammered, so I ran over to my brother's house to give it a listen. What do you know? Same thing.Didn't anybody at the studio give this mix a listen before sending it out? Wholly Cow! What a waste!"
"Positive","Better than History: Though fiction, this book presents a most clear and concise explanation of the enduring hatred the Irish had and still have for the British. Wrapped in a suspense-filled story, the reader is caught up in and experiences the despair and frustration of the Irish citizen trying to exist in his own county in the mid-18th century. However, the fast paced book manages to avoid being a depressing tale. A good read!"
"Positive","Works for me: I am not really good at taking something everyday. . . but I have noticed when I do manage to drink this on a regular basis I feel better. I think the flavor tastes a bit like the old Tang from when I was growing up so not too bad. Over all I will be buying this product again."
"Negative","Included Sony Voice Editor Software Incompatibility: I returned the Sony ICB BM1 due to the loud audible ""click"" it inserts into the recording whenever it is paused. Sony tech support said that it was a characteristic of all BM1's, not just the unit I had. Then I find that the Sony Voice Editor software is incompatible with my Windows XP Media Center pc, and the more current Voice Editor software which came with the BM1 does a ""dirty"" uninstall (leaves it's own dll files in the windows\system folder rather than the Windows dll files it replaced). This caused my Sony ICD MS515 Voice Editor software (an earlier version) not to work. After a week back and forth with Sony tech support, their conclusion is that ALL Sony Voice Editor software is incompatible with Windows XP Media Center pc's, and I was just out of luck that my older Sony ICD MS515 Voice Editor (and the recorder) wouldn't work now after working fine for seven months. I'll never by Sony again, and am waiting for the new Olympus DS-2200."
"Negative","Not worth the money!!!!: We bought this for my 2 1/2 year old for Christmas. We decided to get this one because it was cheaper than the Vsmile and the games were cheaper. Well you get what you pay for with this product. First this was two advance for her. The age was for 3 years and up so we put it away until she was older. After her 3rd Birthday we pulled it out and tried to play it. The starter DVD got stuck on Sponge Bob and we couldn't play any other game on the DVD. We put in the Blue's Clues game and we played sheets 1 and 2 fine when we had to play sheet #3 it wouldn't work. My 3 year old got very frusturated and started to cry. When we got the DVD's working the sheets wouldn't line up with the buttons so when you would press the correct button nothing would happen. She has played with the Vtech Vsmile and loves it. We are going to buy this for her for Christmas."
"Positive","I Could NOT STOP!: This book (Enchanted, Inc. (Katie Chandler, Book 1)) is so amazing, it is the type of book that you can not put down. I do not how many times I have read it, it is that good. I just have to continue reading this series,so my quest to finish it continues in Shanna Swendson'sOnce Upon Stilettos (Katie Chandler, Book 2). Enjoy :)"
"Negative","What a Turkey!!!: Horrible little book I bought in despertaion at some airport. Please save yourself the money of buying this. Just a run of the mill travel book with vague attempts at humour but more often just boring."
"Positive","Tai Chi for Health: Yang Long Form: I bought this dvd for my husband who had done this form of Tai Chi twenty years ago. This was the form he has been looking for. If you know the basics of this type of Tai Chi, this dvd is really an excellent refresher course. Sometimes, though it is hard to follow the instructor, but if you watch the dvd first and then practice with the teacher it is a really great program."
"Negative","DO NOT BUY THIS DVD: If I could give it a negative star I would. This DVD has absoulutely NOTHING to do with Christmas and is blatant false advertising. Even the Tom & Jerry classic ""Night Before Chirstmas"" is not included which should have been an obvious choice for a ""Christmas"" DVD. Obviously, this is another example of MGM ripping their customers off. I am amazed that they can get away with this stuff. Luckily I was able to return mine to Walmart and get my money back. Save yourself the time and don't even bother getting it in the first place."
"Negative","Disappointed: I love the DD Warren series. I read all the books and then started this one. It's disappointing. I don't know if it's one of the author's first books or what, but it really reads like a Silhouette romance with some crime thrown in here and there. I don't like the heroine of the story (she's just weak and unlikeable) and I don't like the guy who is helping her (he's a brute and an alcoholic.) Just not the author's best work.I might try one more book in this series, but if it's like this one, I guess I'll just wait for the next DD Warren book to come out."
"Negative","Lessons on what NOT to do if this ever happens to you: Unlike other Bowden books, this one was a little disappointing. Not because of Bowden's style but because the story is just page after page of a [person] who can't keep his mouth shut about his recent find. It is a quick read, because there is not that much to the story. Still, the story could have been summarized more or less in a lenghty magazine column. One last thing, Joey Coyle is made out to be kind of a Robin Hood for how he was giving his money out. From reading the book, I think he was more just someone seeking the attention of being ""that guy"" thus showing his generosity only to increase his fleeting moment of popularity. Ultimately I finished the book only because I paid for it, and I found myself counting the pages until it was finished."
"Negative","Product did not meet expectations: When I opened the package, it was covered in some kind of greasy substance. Had to take out the disc and rinse off the entire case, which now is ruined with water stains. In addition, the disc will not fast forward in my bluray player, I can only skip to the next scene but am unable to fast forward. When I try, the disc freezes. I would have absolutely returned this product had it not been only $10 with shipping. However, This product was not even worth that much."
"Negative","A absolute discrace to hard music: Heavy metal or hard rock what ever you would like to call it has seen many diferant faces. From blues rock muscisians like led zeplen and black sabbath that played around with a little distortion to the kings of rap/metal korn. While slayer is cool death metal is probabally the lowest of all metal. Every Canibal corpse cd has sick!!!! and disgusting art work and every song is about killing some one. A absolute discrace to hard music,"
"Positive","BRASSENS IN 1966: This cd is also available in a 20th anniversary edition of the death of the now legendary songwriter.Few artists have remained as true to their nature like BRASSENS was;a guitar,a bass and lyrics,this is all he needed to create one of the most admired body of work in all french music.This 1966 offering has him toying with his favorite themes:death,women and ancestral ages and still managing to shape a marvellous product that defies the ages.The first song SUPPLIQUE...is one of his most famous and rightly so,since it deals with his imaginary death;if you don't know much about the french language,you better pass that one;LES QUATRE BACHELIERS is GEORGES's tribute to his father;LE MOYENNAGEUX has him saying he should have lived in the middle age;LA FESSÉE is actually about the dubious nature of some women.In all, this is a grade A BRASSENS recording ,that fans should possess."
"Negative","can't find the fun: A very boring game. Nothing to do but run around and become bored. The sea battles are nothing to brag about as they are boring as well except they have more noise when a ship blows up. Got to the end of this game and thought, ""wow, I never knew it was so cool to be bored.""Same enemies over and over again, except at sea, as the game progresses, one runs into more and more ships.But on the upside, the game is like a Disney trip. At Disney land, you can stand in a long line and be bored and when you get to your ride, you are too tired to be excited. Same in this game, spend all day running around and when you get into a battle it is so boring that you might feel like saying, ""wow, this is so cool to be bored.""This game wouldn't hold the attention of a 4 year old. In fact this game made me think I had ADD.Rent this first, and then if you think it is cool to be bored, buy it."
"Negative","Compilation of banalities: The book to me was useless. There were a couple of items that may have been useful, but overall this was a compilation of banal truths that you can find elsewaher and written in more amusing manner. I don't recommend it."
"Negative","A poor excuse for a game....: With the coming of many other MMORPG in the next month, there is no reason to pick up this game. The reason?Simple, this add-on is unfinished and shouldn't have left beta stage; While UO in itself is a good , outdated graphically,game, this 'facelift' seems to have turned bad. Its unstable, many crash issues, the 3D graphics are barely acceptable in today's expectations, but still require some very powerful hardware to run it! Patches for a live game should be made to ADD thing to the game and REPAIR game issues that couldn't be foreseen. That's absolutely not the case here, this software is an insult to consummers. Paying 40$ for a game still in 'beta' stage is too high a price."
"Positive","Psychograss ""Like Minds"" (1996): A true supergroup in the realm of Newgrass-- takes Dawg Music to new heights of virtuosity, compositional complexity, wit, and even -- gasp-- beauty. Going on seventeen years old and still fresh as a spring rain."
"Positive","A real SWAT officers review: I bought this game because i just wanted something that reflects on my work. I usually dont play video games so i was origionally planing on just buying it for my neice so she could see kind of what i do for a living. When i installed it into the computer i decided to play it a bit to see if it was what i really do. Well let me tell you this, i dont think it could get any more realistic. My neice is 14 and she plays it whenever she is at my house....she never really understood what i did for a living and now that she has played this game i think it pretty much summed it up for her."
"Negative","Amazing, un-professionally written smut novel!: Even as a Republican whose stomach turns at the sight of Bill Clinton's face or the sound of his voice, I still found this collection of un-documented bachanalian anecdotes impossible to swallow.The text contains absolutely no citations. At the end of the book, the author provides a partial list of people he ""consulted"" while doing his research.Basically, all he did was take a sample of the most egregious stories from books such as ""All Too Human"" and ""Unlimited Access"" and weaves in with them a truckload of sordid second-hand rumors, and calls it ""an all-American love story.""The so-called author should face charges for character assasination. I don't doubt that some of the stories are true, nor am I casting the President as a victim of someone else's lies. The greatest victim in this story is Truth itself."
"Negative","Unbelievable: I can't believe any responsible parent would buy or allow their daughters to read this. Sexual education about your body should be taught by the parents. CHILDREN should not be having sex or given INSTRUCTIONS and TIPS on how to do it like this book does.DISGUSTING!"
"Negative","An okay collection: The 28th Century Masters - 98 Degrees contains five videos: Invisible Man (the original black and white version), Because of You, The Hardest Thing, I Do (Cherish You), and Give Me Just One Night (Una Noche).Overall, if you are a big 98 Degrees fan and the above videos are the only ones you like, then get it. Otherwise, I would get 98 Degrees- The Collection. It's a lot better because it comes with their story as well as ALL of their videos (including the Spanish version of Give Me Just One Night)."
"Positive","The Best: Milton is the only air pressure gauge I trust for high pressure applications. My motorhome steer tires require 120psi and every inexpensive gauge has failed to properly inflate the tire. The Milton has been crossed checked by several commercial sources and always comes in +/- 1 pound. My last Milton lasted 16 years so the cost spread over the life makes it a good investment. The larger size also makes it a lot easier to use and a lot harder to loose!"
"Positive","John Powers classic: After re-reading ""The Last catholic in America"" recently I discovered he had written a 3rd book in the series and promptly ordered ""the Unoriginal Sinner and the Ice Cream God."" I grew up in the same Chicago south side neighborhood as John (he went to grade school with my oldest brother and I went to High school with his sister.) Being able to relate on that level made my enjoyment of this book even more special but his witty humor and interesting characters would make this book great reading no matter where you grew up. I recommend reading all his books and highly recommend this one. john Powers does not disappoint!"
"Negative","Poor Quality Product: This is a nicely made lantern EXCEPT that the finish is only a surface coat that peels off revealing an unattractive gray metal. I purchased 8 of these at various points over the past 4 years and all are peeling. I live in a mild climate so I was surprised. I contacted the manufacturer - Whitehall Products - and was told there is a one year warranty and they take no responsibility for their products after that. Given the high cost of these lanterns the manufacturer should do better - both in applying a better finish to begin with and standing behind their products after they are sold. I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THESE.Update: After several back and forths, the company offered to supply replacement parts at half price. This is better than nothing but I still feel that a durable finish should have been used in the production of these lanterns."
"Negative","Detrimental to Milk Supply: The hospital lactation consultants really pushed this item. Know that this is detrimental to your milk supply. The baby cannot successfully compress the sinuses around the nipple if he latches on to this shield as he will suck more like he would a bottle. It took me 5 very long and frustrating weeks to wean my baby from this thing. That was time I could have spent enjoying my baby rather than fighting with him. Giving him whole, natural breast milk is extremely important to me or I would have given up and just went to formula. A friend of mine gave up on breast feeding all together when faced with the same problem. The same consultants at the same hospital pushed it on her as well.If you have flat or inverted nipple know that you do not need an aid. Your baby knows no other nipple and will figure it out. Once the La Leche League leader in my area told me this, it gave me the strength to go for weaning my baby from it."
"Positive","A voice like warm silk to melt your heart!: This CD is the closest you'll ever get to pure love music. I've sent it to my closest loved ones."
"Positive","very well done: Good overview of bacons working career. color is good,images clear and explanations of work and time frame very well organized"
"Negative","A humerous representation of an Alien landing: What would happen if a pair of chattering teeth came from one of the moons of Jupiter to inhabit a human corpse and wreak havoc on homosexual college students? I really didn't know until I saw this movie. If Mystery Science Theater took requests I would think that this movie would be perfect for them. Let me tell you this movie was so low budget that the dubbing was at least a fourth of a second off the whole way through. If it wasn't for the lack of dialouge, plot, good camera work, and dazzling special effects I would have given this movie five stars but it was funny and what else was I going to do for 48 minutes (I fast forwarded through most of it) so I decided to give it a 2. You should see it anyway though because then I'll know that someone else had to watch it too. We can't let great low budget movies vanish from the video archives. We can't let that happen!"
"Negative","Boring: I borrowed this DVD from the library and I'm glad I did. Even though I didnt get every single move right away, I was bored less than 1/2 way through, turned it off, and got out a DVD I have been doing for months. This is by far the most boring workout I have tried."
"Negative","Poor quality.: Paper peeling off. Looks better in the photo that it does when it arrives. Not durable at all. I returned it."
"Positive","Mityvac: Ordered from Tool Topia. Quick shipping. Works great for my 98 Avalon. Remember to unscrew oil filler cap so a vacuum is not created. Easy to dump the oil from at local parts shop. Great product."
"Positive","Brings back memories: I remember playing this album (back in the days of LPs) over and over again, as I contemplated my navel... Classic collectible."
"Negative","Same story, different town: I first read the Yellow Rose Trilogy which I loved!!! That is why I bought the California series. I am giving this 2 stars not because it isn't a good book. It would have been a good book if I hadn't read the Yellow Rose Trilogy first. This is more of the same. Boy meets girl. Won't admit their love. Share a common faith. Finally admit they love each other. The only thing different is the names and the town!! Lori Wick is an excellent author and I share her faith in Christ. I just feel this is ""more of the same""."
"Negative","Skip it: Everyone told me how important this book was while I was in undergrad; I still don't see why. The book is unnecessarily hard to read and follow. He uses thousands of words, when a few short paragraphs will suffice. Even my professor admitted he had read it multiple times and still doesn't understand it completely. It's as if he thought being incomprehensible would give his ideas more clout; it actually just shows what a poor writer he was. Not a fan."
"Negative","Just okay, nothing to rave about: I have two of these feeders in my yard along with several others and these are always the last to empty if even at all. Most of the time I have to dump the liquid as the birds don't empty it before the liquid begins to rot. Based on my other feeders I think it's the flower that may keep the birds away until they are desperate for food. The birds seem to go after the tube or funnel shaped flowers first and these are just flat. The price was right, so I'm not to upset with the quality."
"Negative","Clumsy, frustrating, and now collecting dust.: This game was a big disappointment. I'd even venture to say that it illustrates how NOT to design an educational game. The clumsiness of the game gets in the way of the learning and the fun. The controls - at least for the math game (my daughter and I got fed up and didn't try the others) - are not at all intuitive. Buyers who don't read manuals carefully, beware. But at least you'd think the game would become fun once that wall was scaled. Unfortunately, the mechanism for making Mr. Incredible move the math blocks is so clumsy that, whether you can solve the math problems or not, it's very difficult to move 5 of them to their proper spots in 60 seconds. This seems to leave you stuck at the first level of the game, regardless of your math knowledge. Is the point to have fun and practice math, or to learn how to move blocks?"
"Negative","Bah Humbug!: I'm tired of writers playing fast and loose with science. This is science fiction at it's worst and a total waste of time.James Patterson should stick to what he does best---detective stories."
"Negative","Not at all good or impressive: The original Wrestlemania was in no way at all a good game. It was boring, slow and every wrestler had the same exact moves and more or less looked the same.Wrestlemania wasn't meant to be a stand out game. I think it was meant to be the beginning of something else because after this came WWF Royal Rumble and WWF Raw which some of us plated to death.I would surpass this one and go straight to either WWF Royal Rumble or WWF RAW."
"Positive","Works as advertised...: I bought this Auto Meter 6391 Cobalt Digital Voltmeter Gauge, obviously, to monitor the charging system in my truck. My 1989 Nissan pickup only has an idiot light to indicate a problem, and I wanted a better way to ensure my alternator was actually charging my battery, and that the battery was holding a charge. After using it for a few weeks now, I can say I've not had any problems at all. The indicator is large and bright enough to see even in broad daylight. It has a lead to connect to the vehicle's lights, but I haven't hooked it up, and don't know why I would ever need to. I checked a local trucking supply house for this meter, and the best they could do was order it for me for $135. I got it from Amazon for around $88 plus shipping. There are cheaper meters out there, but this brand seems to have a good reputation, and like I said, I've had no problems at all. I'm very happy with this meter."
"Negative","7 Meg MAX. SLOW and obsolete.: This was a decent unit when it was new. I used one for years but when Comcast got above 7 meg (now 22) this could not perform above 7. Don't buy if you have more than 7 meg as this will be the weak link in your chain. I upgraded to the FVS318G 4 years ago and that is a big improvement but limited to 22 MEG. Its time for a new upgrade."
"Positive","Love It!!!: Must get, total organization that looks cool!! You will know exactly what you have in each drawer..I had fun putting my makeup in each compartment..I also found a lot of makeup I diidn't remember I had.."
"Negative","disappointed: If this were a $15 purchase I would give it 4-5 stars, but considering the description and cost this is a terrible replica. Hammer barely works and is cheaply made. This is nothing more than a toy and not a replica.On the bright side shipping was prompt."
"Positive","A Great Love Story: This story is a great story that men and women can relate to. I think that the story is very funny. If you haven't been in love it makes you want to.The book also shows how one person and greed can turn a beautiful relationship sour. This book is a must have."
"Positive","Too hard, too easy...You've got to be kidding me!: My family LOVES this game. We happened to pick it up late one night and thought it might be a good way to break the ice with new inlaws over for the holidays. Before this game, you could feel the akwardness in the air...but after we played one night we got a long just fine. We all started out quiet, but once we started to get more competitive we wer yelling answers at the top of our lungs! Sure some questions were relly hard, and some were really easy...but it's just the same as Trivial Pursuit. If you're not savvy in a certain subject, of course it's going to be hard. THAT'S THE POINT!"
"Negative","Where is Rufus Miller when we need him most?: I can think of no other group that has shuffled around lead vocalists as much as Tower of Power. Fortunately, the shuffling continued and the group found a talented lead vocalist for ""Souled Out"". The vocals on this album are flat and lack the soulful edge to which fans have grown accustomed. The album dares ask the question, ""What if Mr. Mister had a horn section?"""
"Negative","what's missing: ok, this cd is, i suppose, fairly okay in its own right; some of the songs are pretty good, like ""ballad for dead friends"" and ""prayer of saint francis""; but what i am wondering is when are they gonna come out with a cd with all the REALLY GOOD music from this show??? There's so much stuff from the fifth, sixth and seventh seasons that's completely passed over (like the song that plays during 'touched' and the one that plays at the end of 'entropy'...)"
"Positive","Love could not be denied, finally: This is one in a series about the Rose Cottage sisters. Each one can be independently read - no cliffhangers. This is a great read about finding and resisting love, and how ""resistence is futile"" - even for love. I thoroughly enjoyed this one."
"Negative","Out Dated: The disk it comes with to install the program on your computer is out dated.... way out dated... try Windows 98, 2000 or XP, and the bad thing is it wont work with anything newer then that. I called Memorex and they sent me templates to use with Word and that doesnt work!!! Look for something with new software!!!"
"Negative","WARNING! MISLEADING AD! I'M SO DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS SELLER!: Please do not buy from this seller. I ordered this product thinking that this was a regular nursing pillow but when I received it, it was an inflatable pillow. The description of the product is not complete. I left a message for them to cancel my order but nobody returned my call. I called them back and the item was already shipped. I was told to just return the product when I receive it which I did and I found out that this item is not returnable. Their customer service people are IMPOLITE! They won't even let me talk to their manager. I will never order from this seller (HAPPY MOTHERS) again. I'm not happy at all. I just wasted my time and money on something that i didnt like. Please don't be mislead in buying from this seller too."
"Negative","Lock changes combination by itself - Do not buy: I have been using this lock for a few months without changing the combination. Suddenly I could no longer open it as it appears that the lock has changed its combination by itself.I called engineering in the hotel I was staying in to help me. It took them less than a minute to cut the cable with ordinary pliers."
"Positive","Very Solid Component for the Price: Full, rich sound with a thoughtfully-organized rear panel and an impressive roster of DSP modes. Very easy to set up and use. My only complaint: The device can't remember individual channel settings for separate source inputs. For example, I like to watch DVDs with the center channel set at +5 dB, so that dialogue pops more clearly. But for music, I prefer to use a surround mode with the center channel at -5, which increases the field depth to my ears. With this receiver, that's impossible unless I want to get used to changing the settings every time I switch back and forth. Different DSP modes are retained for each source, but the more granular audio and channel settings are system-wide. Not a huge inconvenience, but important to know if you want a high level of control over your listening experience."
"Negative","Even all the positive reviews cannot save this book: I thought this book wasn't informing readers about Islam. It seems she allows Islam into her life when it suits her. Islam is a way of life not an accessory to it. The author fails miserably in convincing this reader of her sincerity and her knowledge of Islam."
"Negative","Great recording that doesn't play!: These CD-R recordings that are burnt to CD when you order them don't play on any machine, either PC or CD player!"
"Negative","What Was This??: It seems like Ginuwine just threw this album together. This is not what I was used to hearing from him. I was used to seeing Ginuwine as a slow ballad kind of person. I only found three songs that I liked on The Life."
"Negative","at war with itself: We bought this book on the strength of its reviews. My husbond says its one of the poorest attempts to rip-off a certain old T.V. show he's ever seen. I happen to like that old show and feel SB: 1 or God is a good story, but not-so-well written. The story line seems at war with itself. .it wants to be good but someone won't let it. There is a force working aginst the flow of it. It's not like other books I have read, there is something different about this author's English usage. I don't mean that in a snobbish way, it's jerky or irregular or something like that."
"Positive","Great Camera for Novice: I bought this camera and 1-week later headed for the Galapagos Islands. The camera was simple to use and wonderful photos resulted. We carried two lenses and 3 Gigs of memory for a 10-day trip. The battery held the charge--I had bought spare batteries and only needed to replace them once. I was impressed! I am hoping that photograpghy will be a new love in our life, and the camera will let us begin that journey."
"Negative","Terrible high frequency response...sounds washed out: Terrible high frequency response....basically it is non existent. Far inferior to the free headsets that came with Sony Walkman and CD players that broke over the years. I strongly recommend against these phones. I bought two of them without checking them out in advance. This was a mistake."
"Positive","Book Thief: When my book club selected this title I was more than a little skeptical, especially since it was written in a very different style than I was used to and billed as a 'young adult' book. Once I started reading it I became swept up in it. It was very interesting to view the events of WWII Germany through the eyes of German people who were not captivated by Hitler's rhetoric. It is easy to forget there were brave souls who, in their own ways, protested his iron rule, often risking their own lives and comfort to do so. The Book Thief would be an excellent companion to The Diary of Anne Frank. This book should be a must read for every adult and young adult. It is a book that stays with you long after you have finished the last chapter."
"Negative","It's just not that good: As other 2-star reviewers have mentioned, this book is extremely simple and basic in its treatment of scientific writing. Really, to write well you need: practice and correct English beaten into you.Does cover how editors handle your paper, and that's really the only detailed section, the whole book could then be around 30 pages. If you wrote a paper on the computer in high school with a graph or picture, circa 1998, you were more technologically advanced than several of the sections in the book, most scientists were ahead of that."
"Negative","Just plain bad: I was excited to get this book for I hoped it would further my understanding into a subject I had increasingly grown interested in...The criminal mind. When flipping through it, it seems like a great read, complete with case studies and forensic psychologyLittle did I know that this was a huge step backwards and to the side from other books I had read on the subject. Not only was it not interesting AT ALL, I was horrified to realize that this even begins going into other subjects that are not even close to being scientific in nature.If you want to read about Freud or Graphology (which is a joke--about as scientific as phrenology) thats fine. But don't expect those scientifically invalid interpretations of the mind to help you better understand the fast moving pace of research and experimentation that is forensic science.Instead stick with Mindhunter, the Crime Classification Manual, or anything that has a research bibliography in the back."
"Positive","Weirdly comfortable.: Who hasn't used one of these? It was Epic when it was brought out, revolutionary, the first true analog stick, what else needs to be said. If your like me (a classic gamer) then you have to have a N64 in your arsenal, well you need the steering will to drive a car, nuff' said."
"Positive","An excellent textbook!: Applied Stochastic Hydrogeology is easily the best book of this century in its field. Its intuitive and down-to-earth style makes even the most intricate aspects of stochastic analyses readily accessible to both graduate students and active researchers. The subjects the book covers range from stochastic site characterization and image reconstruction from sparse data to the concept of effective hydraulic parameters and probabilistic assessment of flow and transport in heterogeneous environments."
"Negative","perfectly awful, though Lugosi rises above all others: This is a war spy film about a group of Japanese men placed in the US as a fifth column, taking the place of businessmen. I was intrigued by it because it sounds like ""the hundred days of the dragon"" that was an early Outer Limits episode. Unfortunately, the film has simply terrible acting, with the exception of the mysterious mastermind as played by Lugosi. The men are like sleeper agents, waiting to be activiated by hypnotism. It comes off as both unbelievable and unbearably slow, with wooden dialogue and the crudest stereotypes of ""the enemy"" that one can imagine.Not recommended."
"Positive","study of bible.: doing a study of the bible and at present up to the book of Luke. He being the only gentile mentioned or the rest are jews, so this gospel of luke by william Barclay came in very handy Kia Ora Graham."
"Positive","Not sure how some people don't like this sprinkler: I got this a week ago and it is perfect. Very durable! All adjustments are easy and isn't even hard to do while the water is running. Some of the reviews here say that it has problems but there are no issues at all. If you play around with the thing a bit you learn what each adjustment piece does and it is easy. It shoots water very far but that can be controlled with the top metal flap, on the slow clockwise pattern it launches water far but then on the counterclockwise return it gets the stuff closer to it, everything gets watered. There is a tad bit of overspray on the sides but that is inherent in this type of sprinkler's design. When the arm slaps the water to cause it to turn a little tiny bit sprays to the side, it is minimal and really shouldn't be worried about whatsoever. I bought a LOT of sprinklers before this one, this is by far the best one in this price range. Don't let the negative reviews persuade you, this is a great sprinkler."
"Negative","Do not buy this toy: We received this toy as a gift and I wish we never had. We spent hours and hours trying to get the thing to work. We even bought a new DVD player trying to get it to work. Several calls to the help center only made us try longer to get the crazy thing to link to a DVD player. The call center gives you a ton of codes to try and each attempt takes some time. We finally got it to work on one of 5 DVD players in our house. It disconnects easily however and needs to be reset. The cursor to select the games also sometimes does not work.I would NOT recommend this toy. It is NOT user friendly."
"Positive","Finally: Finally! This is finally here as sought after for so many years. There are so many fine reviews here that I need not repeat them, but let the music speak for itself.Ant Phillips is one of the only tried and true, and I and a whole lot of others bow to him for valuing his values and yet being quite active in this very disdainful world that we've created.I would take my hat off to you Anthony, but the glare, my god, the glare!"
"Positive","Good fun: WE had a good time with the float on Lake huron while the water was calm. A few days it was rather choppy and the float pulled the anchor up and got a few of the kids sea sick which was our fault. Good times though."
"Positive","Derma Wand really got me started on taking better care of myself.: I was hooked on this wand and loved the oxygen smell. One time my eyes was really puffy when I woke up. I used the Derma Wand for ten minutes and I saw a huge difference."
"Positive","old shows: this was a favorite of mine and my familys we all loved this and decided to buy the seasons"
"Positive","Not pills for me: Made me sad to realize I just can't expect to find a pill to ""cure all"" and I learned that from the book. Liked the book and the different things in it. I must admit I have thought in the past all this natural stuff is for the birds but when I see so many people not getting better and just taking more pills it frightens me. I'm tossing the quick fix idea out and have now I'm doing some of the things in the book. It really isn't so bad and weird."
"Positive","What more can you say it's Kiss: Great Cd, the song just is not Kiss, you can tell right off the bat it was not written by Kiss, because it has no edge, most of the tracks are great, the AC/DC remake just plain out sucks!! Manson needs to learn to sing and AC/DC should file a law suit. But as for the rest it is a great cd, i would highly recomend buying it, just skip track 6. Kiss I hope the Rumors aren't true that this will be a farewell tour, you guy are the greatest!!"
"Negative","boring and waaaayyy too much detail: like most people, i was forced to read the book for school...let me just say, if you have insomnia, i recommend this book...itll put u rite to sleep"
"Positive","Segal DVD: This is an excellent job of catching the essence of Bill Segal and being uplifted by the presentation. It has the combination of the great simplicity of the Zen tradition which Bill treasured and the quality of sustained effort practiced in the Gurdjieff work. He is missed."
"Positive","Renaissance: Kitaro's latest albums like ""ancient"" or ""ancient journey"" were not bad albums, but very superficiel ones which made me think that kitaro was repeating himself and that he has lost his creative talent. Then listened to ""the sacred journey of kukai"" And thought that the great kitaro was reborn!In this album, there are no fast pieces as in ""thinking of you"" or ""mandala"", but all the pieces are giving rest and serenity to your soul, and make you feel good with their enchanting melodies, positive energy and with those electrfying bells from different temples.Kitaro has proved once again that he is the master of New Age. And can hardly wait for the volume two of ""the sacred journey of kukai"""
"Negative","don't expect more like ""Coolo"": If you've heard ""Coolo"" on the movie soundtrack and think that you'll get more of the same on this album you're in for a disappointment, as there is nothing else even remotely similar on this disc."
"Positive","Martha's House: This book was my daughter's favorite story book when she was little. She loved this book. I still have the book but it was missing the first few pages. She was wanting this book for her baby. When I finally saw this I had to purchase for her. She was so excited about getting this book. Thank you so much."
"Negative","Breathtakingly repetitive. Preachy... nooo fun.: I am a huge Tom Clancy fan, but this book was just painful to read. I cannot think of another book I've read which is so breathtakingly repetitive. The dialogue is canned, and is practicly recycled every few chapters. There is an immensely preachy edge to this book, and I don't know if it reflects Clancy's beliefs (I hope not), or is meant to engage us in the utterly shallow characters. This book might have made a decent short story of around 30 or 40 pages, but as a full length novel it is boring and trite. With this following on the heels of Red Rabbit (which was like a watered down recyling of cardinal of the kremlin) I have to wonder if Clancy is even writing these books anymore. they are just that poor."
"Negative","NOT TOO GREAT: I AM IN THE PROCESS OF READING THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW. THE WRITING IS TRULY DISJOINTED AND SOME PARAGRAPHS HAVE TO BE REREAD TO COMPREHEND. IT'S NOT THE WORST BOOK I'VE READ OF THIS GENRE AND IT'S SOUNDS LIKE SOME OF THI IS BACK TO THE WRITERS UNSUAL STYLE...FICTION!!!!!"
"Negative","If the screen worked it would be a good reader: This is the second time I have had to replace this reader. It would be a nice product if (big IF) the screen didn't fail so often. The first on went blank and the second one has horizontal and vertical lines making it impossible to read... The product has a lot going for it... when it works."
"Positive","Profiles in courage: Irons does of fine job of describing the uphill battle that a variety of individuals have faced in asserting their basic rights as Americans. Some of these cases righted grevious wrongs, and others are more open to debate. But then, the law is not a popularity contest. The fact that humble and even unpopular cases can nonetheless get their day in court, and get fair and due process, is something that every American should be proud of. It's something worth remembering and defending, something worth protecting, and Peter Irons shows you *why* in this book."
"Negative","waste of buying a memory card: this memory card by NYKO is a very bad thing to buy, here is the number one reason1. after a few months of using this card your data and saves becomes corrupt.look bottom line is this card is a rip off and it is not reliable.I use normal Sony Playstation 2 8mb Memory cards and they work fine!With Sony Cards they data and saves do not get corrupt, and they are very reliable memory cards.Stick with Sony 8MB Memory Cards and you will never have a problum."
"Positive","Great!!!: This album is absolutly out of this world; the mix of trip hop, jazz (the Chet Baker cover is beatiful), hip hop and, the main character, tango is just amazing. Imagine Astor, Anibal, the voices of the outskirts of Manhattan (were I've told the hip-hop was born) and Peter Kruder having a joyfull, solid, ethereal, fruitful conversation.Just give it a listen..."
"Negative","Borders on cheesy: I enjoyed the first two songs of this CD but on song 3 a cheesy conga beat from a 20 dollar casio keyboard kicks in and it all starts going downhill. It's not as if the electronic sounds have a kitsch retro feel like Air--they just sound dated and cheap like something from an eighties Phil Collins rock ballad. He crosses the fine line between tongue-in-cheek kitsch and REAL kitsch. This would be a fine band if they got rid of some of the horrible background orchestrations. The singer has a smooth voice, the lyrics are good, and they've got nice melodies with good hooks."
"Positive","Does the job: Man groomer does the job. Good buy for the price. Takes practice to get a technic that works, but overall good purchase."
"Negative","Beware of Product Claims: As per the previous comment, the unit DOES NOT provide track information on the Sony head unit. I purchased it because the marketing material said it would show ID3 tags on units that had this. Well my Sony unit has this feature and it did not show anything but erroneous track information. Dension support admitted this is the case. I also could not get the head unit to advance, start and stop the iPod - which may be a fault in my particular unit. So if you are looking to use your Sony head unit rather than the iPod for navigating tracks, you will have to look elsewhere. Not much value for money in my opinion and I am returning mine too."
"Positive","Pleasantly surprised: I was so excited when the Amazon box arrived, I knew my much awaited little bird feeders we're inside. So I open the box and my first thought is, how in the world could this be worth $9? It seemed more like a dollar store buy but still I put them (two) up on our windows with no problem at all. I cleaned the windows and per a review used a little swipe of T-zone oil and it worked like a charm. I didn't have one single visitor for about two weeks and I was really disappointed. Then all of a sudden there we're birds practically lining up, they come to my feeders all day long! I did notice that some of the seed was kind of escaping through the bottom where the two pieces come together but a piece of heavy duty tape fixed that immediately. I absolutely LOVE this little feeder, it's easy to fill up and it provides endless enjoyment watching the birds!"
"Negative","Disappointing: Lacked the strong developed plots of the previous books with undervelopement of intercharacter relationships. Disturbingly remeniscent of the later Anita Blake books with regard to excessive male attention that is annoyingly distracting of the main plot and its clear development."
"Positive","Very well written!: This was the third book I read by Susan Donovan and I loved it. It's very well written and keeps you engrossed in the story throughout. I think so many of us can relate to Lucy who have either tried to lose weight in the past or are still trying and the icing on the cake is ofcourse the hero and the way they fall in love. All in all, very good story with real characters who you can relate to."
"Negative","Greed is not always good: I guess 1 billion plus at the worldwide box-office is not good enough. Not to mention how much the studio made after they duped us all by releasing TWO different versions of the films. I absolutely love these movies but I will wait for the extended versions before I buy the blu-ray. I don't mind shelling out a few bucks more special edition blu-rays but when greedy studio executives try get more money from us in this economy it completely amazes me the mindset of people. Why couldn't they put both versions on one disc each. We all know why. Its not like they wouldn't fit. There is plenty of room on a dual layer disc. Even if there isn't they could package them together. But it seems greed will always win out."
"Positive","yaya: Very good sized bib, its long which anyone knows it really helps.Cute design I would recommend it, its also waterproof,good buy."
"Negative","what happened!!!: mature=boring.if you are a replacements fan or solo westerberg fan rum as fast as you can away from this tragedy.easily the worst work hes EVER produced.a straight a student brings home an f!(if i could have given this 0 stars i would have!)"
"Positive","A Compelling Story That Entertains While It Educates: Phillip Van Hooser does, indeed, have guts. That's what it took to tell his compelling story that takes the reader on an amazing journey. An emotional roller coaster, this book draws you in from the first page. You can't wait to find out how Phil's story turns out. This is the first book I've ever read that enabled me to learn a lot about a disease while caring so much about the writer's own experience with it. It's funny, poignant, sad, hopeful, and at times even scarey. But by the end I felt an enormous sense of relief not just for Phil, but for everyone whose life is touched by IBD, colitis or crohn's disease. His message of hope is uplifting and his storytelling ability is unsurpassed. If you know someone with IBD, give them this book. It will be a treasured resource they'll use over and over!"
"Positive","Exactly What I Needed: Just as advertised. Works great. Had no problems what-so-ever. Added another hard drive to my computer with these and after several months everything is still working."
"Positive","Grand Finales is a Grand book: The book ""Grand Finales"" is a book for all people who are interested in pastry and cooking. It is very discriptive and has many recipies with fondations so you can make mank differnet dishes."
"Negative","Do NOT purchase the extra bits and screws!!!: The product image (shows only the adapter), lack of description, and the fact that they suggest a package deal with all three products is a scam. The kit already includes the bit and screws. You do not need 2 bits. You may need extra screws but the kit comes with plenty already."
"Negative","Total waste of money: Makes a mess in my kitchen every time I use it. The little hole in the top causes a hot spray of watery rice fluid to shoot out and everywhere. Didn't last very long either, the nonstick coating started to bubble up, while it was still usable, half the rice I cooked stuck pretty badly to the bottom. If you were only ever to use it to steam veggies, it may work better, as I didn't steam much with it. But as a rice cooker alone I hate this product."
"Positive","Corelle Impressions Abumdance: I'm happy to find that these are still available. I was missing a few plates, etc that were probably broken along the way so replaced with this new set. They match perfectly. No complaints here!"
"Positive","Exciting!: I started reading this at the start of the year, but never got to finish it because it was a library paperback. Read the rest of it now. Loved it! :D"
"Positive","Carnival Party: Perfect for my carnival party. Used wooden cookie sticks to give them a vintage look. Make sure you purchase the right size sticks."
"Positive","Great!: Yummy, healthy fun snack. Great whether you eat them right out of the bag or put them in cereal, yogurt whatever. Highly recommend."
"Negative","Great album, but the sound...: The album was remastered from a copy of the British stereo master tape and is the worst example of NoNoise abuse I have ever heard. Try the Gold CD version on DCC to hear what the album really sounded like when it was first released on Island/Chrysalis in the early 70s (that was remastered without NoNoise and from the original master) The bonus tracks sounded better on the 20th anniversary box set."
"Positive","Compelling and thoughtfully written: Read this by chance! Am not familiar with this author but enjoyed the storyline. The book was a quick read. Not a lot of action but compelling enough to keep the pages turning. I enjoyed the characters and will purchase the next book to see where they've wound up."
"Negative","Not a big improvement, but still better than the antenna included: only slightly better than the antenna included. you need to have a CLEAR VIEW of the sky and roof access, both of which I dont have, to get perfcect reception"
"Positive","Easy to use and recommended: The ease of use is perfect for beginners like me. I have a few books on this subject and i would recommend it to others. Good recipes"
"Positive","Corvette Magazine: Great magazine dedicated to Corvettes of all years. Well written articles and technically sound columns. I look forward to each issue."
"Negative","El Gran Homenaje A Javier Solis: I have been a lover of Javier Solis since I was five years old I remember telling my mom and grandmother I am going to marry Javier some day. They of course laughed since Javier was already dead, then I will marry him in heaven. So I do know Javier when I hear him sing. I can assure you that this is an insult to his memory and to those of us who adore him. He is by all account like no other, and no other will ever compair to him."
"Positive","great game very addicting: i like the controls and the plot, but i guess it may just be not realistic enough for me. im a huge fan of resident evil 4 and other shooting games.. i also think the 'text' when people are talking is a little lame, i would have thought a next-gen game that was as important as zelda would have real voices at this point.. but overall a very entertaining game and definitely worth the 50 hours it takes to beat"
"Negative","Not easy to use: I bought this for my son when he was 5 months old, he likes it but everytime he shakes the rattle pooh won't wiggle and play music, I have to shake the rattle for him to work. Pooh will wiggle and play music based on noise, but as for the rattle working like a remote control, as advertised, it does not work unless an adult is using it, which defeats the whole purpose."
"Positive","Better than Ozzie!: Though not enough of the actual racing makes the cut, the reality of family life comes through! As a Dad with two daughters (we're not in the racing business!) I can relate to the story line. They are an American icon family. and it's great to see that they have been documented on film. Better than your average flick. I would highly recommend seeing them race in person, and recommend this DVD to those who have seen them in action. A great look into a real family, as harsh as it may seem. Go Force Racing!"
"Negative","Not all as was....: I am in this book...not all the facts are exactly like it was....and I agree with the person that said there was more information about the families than was necessary."
"Positive","YAY!: I loved this movie! It's fresh and funny. And the coffee part with the little old man is hilarious! Plus, it's got some bonus features, which I really don't remember alot about. Good family comedy, but watch out for the more adult parts. *hint* hint* Have fun with it! A great edition to your DVD corner."
"Positive","An Art Educator Staple: Design Synectics is a stand out browse and reference text for Art educators. I would also highly recommend this book to any creative person. It is like a service manual for the artist/ divergent thinker. Presenting individual visual and cognitive concepts in a schematic that is easy to read and fun to practice. While some of the action items in this book may seem a little too structured, individual educators will have little trouble in customizing the approaches to fit with their style. While many books written for Art teachers only give outdated product based ideas, Design Synectics gives insight into the thinking associated with visual literacy. This book is a true Art educator staple."
"Positive","Pretty good but.....: These are great for frying eggs. My husband was amazed that they did not melt into a puddle while making his sunny side up breakfast. I have to agree with the writer who thought the notch on the handle to be uncomfortable. It kinda digs into your hand and these will discolor in chili or spaghetti sauce. Just a warning. Overall they are good but if you can stretch to buy the Le Crueset then spend the extra $$."
"Positive","A lovely CD: Ok I just received this in the mail this yesterday morning... I enjoyed this the movie and the CD is different... Okay so it's in a language I don't understand... however the musice is fabulous. I put this on I dimmed the lights I poured a drink and there I was with this great CD and I was really relaxed. I am a new found fan of This type of jazz...."
"Negative","Cover gives it away (mostly): If you read the back cover of this book then you basically know what is going to happen . However the advertised third force is a furphy and is unsatisfactorily set aside . This author has regurgitated the tired Freeman and his delta/sas team formula . The only difference is that the scenario is on a smaller scale compared to previous titles .Unfortunately the author seems have to have retained his desire to introduce sexual liasions of ludicrous and unecesary proportions into his books (Hint: Freeman scores) . This wastes time that could have been spent developing the tissue thin plot and characters.In summary: save your money and buy a proper special forces techno thriller ."
"Negative","STILL WAITING: IT HAS BEEN 24 DAYS AND 2 HOURS THAT MY CREDIT CARD WAS BILLED AND I STILL HAVENT RECEIVED MY ORDER! NOT EVEN AN UPDATE OF MY ORDER!"
"Positive","Subil (Two disc special edition): I remember watching this movie some years back and it upset me greatly at the time. I decided to buy it now as I am a collector of true stories. I feel this is absolutely the best acting from Sally Field, It did still upset me to think a mother could do such things to a little girl, but we cant stick our heads in the sand, this did happen and thank God she met the doctor that could help her live somewhat a normally life. A Great movie, so sad but still a great movie."
"Positive","Great for what it is.: Let me be quick and blunt. This is not a serious movie. It is a hyperbole, so to speak. It's over the top, and purposely so. You will not find the answer to life's mysteries in this movie. It is a fun, action movie, with great action sequences, and some hilarious moments. The acting is above average and the writing is good. The plots starts strong and fizzles out a bit toward the end. The ending itself was pretty bad, but this didn't really matter so much due to the fact that there was no mystery to solve, no question to answer, no big world-changing events. It was just a cool movie, worth a good watchin' every now and then. Some people reviewing this are taking it way too seriously....but it's great for what it is - a good way to kill 2 hours. It could be correctly classified as a comedy in my book."
"Negative","The novelty wears off quickly...: It's weird. If you're like me, when you're interested in a game, you go online and research. Check the reviews etc. the problem is: there's just no consistency on these reviews! So I took a calculated risk and bought Godzilla: Domination. Not the best use of your hard earned gaming dollars. The graphics are nice, the control is so-so, the sound, very simplistic. The real problem is that this game is quickly reduced to button-mashing. There are only a few basic moves available but they are all the moves you need to beat this game in about 20 minutes. That's right, TWENTY MINUTES! You can literally trap an opponent in a corner and just never let them up. BOOOOORING! The special moves are cool but you don't need them, in fact it will take you longer to learn how to use the special moves effectively than it will to beat the game by simply pressing ""A"" or ""B"" repeatedly. Take a pass, trust me on this."
"Positive","Superb art-work clearly explains technical graphics: I have the 1966 edition of this book. I was amazed to find it still in print because fashions in technical graphics have changed so much in 30 years.One of my soapbox topics is the poor way our colleges teach engineers and physicists three-dimensional visualization. The most excellent drawings in this book enable the student to see three-dimensional objects even though they are rendered by techical graphics as a sequence of two-dimensional drawings.In spite of its title, no mathematics is involved. Descriptive geometry is a layout and drawing skill. The first three chapters would benefit any wood or sheet-metal worker. Some of the later chapters would benefit geometrically oriented sculptors.Best of breed!"
"Positive","Great product: Thirty minutes later my tailgate was working properly again on my 1999 Jeep Cherokee Classic even in freezing weather. Easy to install, works great. I can't recommend this enough."
"Negative","Disappointed: My child picked this book out of the school library. The pictures and illustrations draw a child to it until you open the book and your 7 year old is reading about homosexual penguins. What a shock!?! It would have been helpful to have a not for under 7 warning on the book or some type of parental warning on it."
"Negative","You will cry over spilled milk: I purchased these bags when I returned to work and began pumping more often. What a waste!! The twist tie design is both clumsy and ineffective. You can never tie them tight enough and spills are frequent. In additon to this, the cost is ridiculous. The Gerber bags with the zip lock design are much more economical and are leak proof. They can be found at most retail stores including Target and Walmart. These bags do not measure up to the Medela name and they should consider a new design. Returning to work and continuing to nurse your baby is hard enough without the hassle of these bags."
"Positive","Yummy: Loved this...kids finished off the entire pot! I added much more to the recipe as it is quite salty. I would say almost doubled everything...adding corn...black beans...onion etc."
"Positive","Shikoku Pilgrimage: I have started reading the book and have only just completed the first chapter. From what I can judge so far, it is a very detailed study of the Shikoku pilgrimage, its historical evoulution and its significance from religious and cultural aspects. The text is very well written and I have found the narration very interesting even though this book or its subject would not arouse much enthusiam among many if judged only by its title. The authour is commended for the quality of his presentation. The book will be extremely very useful to me and my wife who intend to embark on this pilgrimage as soon as we have sufficient funds.The condition of the used book I purched was good and I am happy with it.ThanksChandra"
"Negative","The world's most plagerised movie: Van HelsingWow, I really can't say enough bad things about this movie. It is roughly 75% plagerised from various flicks. I am not speaking of the amalgam of classic monsters, rather I am referring to direct and indirect quotes, effects, themes etc...of other popular movies. Such as Lara Croft, Star Wars, Star Trek, Krull, Shrek, Dune, The Matrix and I know I found more, but would have to watch it again to name them all, which I have no intention of doing. I purchased this movie, but will send it out free to anyone who wants it. I sure as (enter swear word of your choice) don't want this piece of garbage in my collection."
"Negative","I would not recommend it !: There are some mistakes about harmony theory in the book which could make students confusing . Example: Page #46 - ""B7 was included as Original Diatonic Chord in C Major"" - No one could get this chord using the C Major scale bacause (Ab) does not exist in the scale . Therefore it is not an Original Diatonic Chord."
"Positive","absolutely perfect: the only one I could find with the height I needed. Well wrapped, no damage and arrived earlier than I expected! Love it!"
"Positive","SHE IS BAAAACK!!!: Finally!!! A Madonna album like she used to make 'em back in the day (sorry for dating myself!!). It makes u get up and dance which, quite frankly, is very refreshing being that she went through that whole, ""these-are-my-political-views"" period. I for one want my artists to entertain me, not to tell me their opinions...Great album"
"Negative","Really wish I didn't this: This replacement lumbar pad only needs to be replaced because they break so frequently. I have to replace mine every couple of years since they tend to wear out and break apart at the end clamps."
"Positive","BEST cover out there!: We were looking for something to replace our old cover and found this one. It is very durable, easy to use and pretty nice looking too!"
"Positive","A Big Help: I am a designer who was looking for specific beads and findings and found this book very useful in locating good wholesalers. I use it all the time to locate items I am looking for. Very helpful!"
"Positive","An amazing reference guide for landscape design: If you've ever drooled over perfectly arranged landscapes designed with fabulous color combinations, texture, and an array of plants all sizes and shapes who's colors are pleasing to the eye, this book is your tool. There are many garden companies that offer pre-designed gardens, but they're expensive and sometimes have plants that you just don't care for. This book gives you ideas, plans, tips on how to combine plants in such a way that it looks like a professional landscaper came and did all the work. Every design is wonderful, the photography is superb and the gardens are beautiful. A real asset for anyone who wants to have a beautiful garden without paying a designer/landscaper to do it for you. A great book."
"Negative","Stank: This film was one confusing blob of a mess. One of the worst films I've ever seen. It made me never want to read a Ludlum novel, since that's what it was based on. When I heard an audiotape of Ludlum's memoirs, and he said how he LIKED this film, it REALLY made me never want to read one of his books. Even Michael Caine in his autobiography says that when he got on the set, he read the script more closely, only then to realize it didn't make any sense. But he was stuck, and had to film the darn thing."
"Negative","unrealistic: I think the book is good and although I am not a physician, I trust what he is saying in the book, just find it unrealistic. My day is full. I look for time to just plain relax. How am I suppose to follow these restrictive diets and cook or eat plenty of vegetables when time is of the essence? Until this country adopts vegetables as a necessary option (in fast food restaurants for example) these diets are unrealistic. At least for me. Personally, I find it easier to exercise three times a week and try to eat as healthy as possible. But the diet recommended in this book is for either people with enough time on their hands or people with plenty of money to eat at restaurants with healthy food. Dr. Mercola may be a good physician but he is unrealistic in his views. He also promotes a no vaccine policy. Is this a good idea? Makes me wonder..."
"Positive","Not what I usually like, and yet I enjoyed it: This is one of those books where if you say anything at all, you'll likely ruin it for others.A thirty-something woman looks back on her early life. Vague enough?Even though this book is only a few years old, it already feels very dated--the concerns / issues it raises seem ... well, implausible, and they pale in relation to the real stuff going on in the world right now.Nevertheless, extremely enjoyable and interesting."
"Positive","good read, but not typical wells: As noted by others, this is the story of kind of a floundering everyman stumbling through life. It was interesting and entertaining, but not particularly thought provoking. Note that this is not one of H.G.'s usual sci-fi or futuristic stories, so skip this if that it what you are looking for."
"Negative","Just plain bad: First, the name of the book is misleading. Event driven trading is about selecting stocks that will or have experienced an 'event' that drives the stock higher or lower. The entirety of this book is just a summary/rehash of several other stock picking books based on technical factors and analysis.That said, the only reason I would recommend this book is for someone who has had no previous exposure to the markets.Good thing I only borrowed this book from the library!"
"Negative","Not for Scooters: Got this gauge for my scooter with 10 inch wheels. The neck is too long, and the angle is not steep enough to place it in the back wheel. The exhaust and brakes get in the way. While it worked for the front tire, it was an awkward angle. Seems like decent enough gauge for cars, just not for my scooter."
"Positive","Does what I wanted it to do: I purchased this specific router because it was a good price, and wanted to be able to get online on my laptop. It was easy to set up and has worked from the get-go. I get about 75% signal strength on my laptop when I use it about 50 feet from this router. Have had no problems with it."
"Negative","Yuk!: This bread is the worst I've had. My husband is diabetic and will eat anything that is ""legal"" for him....and he even threw it away. The bread tastes like a dry sponge. Very disappointed."
"Positive","Hostile Witness: I really enjoyed this book by Rebecca Forster. So much, I bought three more of her books. I recommend any mystery/thriller readers try it. I will be buying more of her books."
"Negative","Run, Don't Walk!: ...Although the concept of the mystery is unique, the writerhas used every ""How-To-Write-A-Mystery"" chapter ever known.Her use of sex is unnecessary in most scenes; the murderer is obviousin the first couple of chapters, the story line is ridiculous, and there is no natural flow to the character, Ingrid Beaumont. I understand that Denise Dietz has several books to her credit, so I'm sure she's has improved her writing since the creation of ""Footprints in the Butter""...I hope..."
"Negative","Ok mix, but cut off some tracks: While the overall mix of the album was ok, they cut off some tracks, such as Around the World. This makes one wonder if they did so to others. The overall effect was one of a sampler CD of some great artists. There are better compilation albums out there, take time and look."
"Positive","All but one!: Trial By Jury....very innovative and enjoyable.As for Pinafore, wonderful production, well sung, well staged, well everything, but... but what on earth were they thinking when they cast Little Buttercup? It was like Patti Lupone sings Tosca. Bleh! Otherwise, it's worth it. Would nevertheless recommend."
"Negative","Poor sizing: Not correct size. I have several pairs of these sweats. Gave to friend. Will not order items from this store again, because they may be selling rejects. Don't know for sure."
"Negative","Use your money on something else: Terrible game play as usual from EA.Poorly implemented conroller action."
"Positive","Amazing Film, Wonderful Collection: If you are buying this collection, then chances are you are already a fan of the classic film ""Battle Royale"". The case is quite an inventive and well put-together book design and includes two versions of the first film and one version of the second (inferior, though still interesting, as it may be). The final disc is not actually a blu-ray but a dvd of previously released extra content.Worth the money."
"Positive","Makes my Heart Swoon: Two Thunderous Souls Melting into one Rapturous Boom.JL always strikes a cord in us, with her stories of Passion, Hate,Love and Ultimately the Surrender Ones Will.In Heart of Thunder you meet a strong-will gun slinging free spirited woman and a strong-will ex bandito man who's only desire is to buy back his family's land. Instantly the Heat spreads and the passion melts as the guns fire into a Love/Hate affair."
"Negative","Great product, new cars defeat it: The product itself is great. I own several. They used to work wonderfully, but my newer cars disconnect the lighter socket when they are not running. Therefore, the charger doesn't do anything. Yes, I could get the lighter socket rewired. The thing I loved about this was how easy it was. Taking my car in to be rewired to use it is not what I consider easy.Great Product. Lousy new cars."
"Positive","This fudge is awesome!: Incredible vanilla fudge flavored with vanilla bean paste. So rich and creamy it melts in your mouth! Perfect for any vanilla or white chocolate lover... order yours today!"
"Negative","It's 2003, People!: Unbelievably overblown, melodramatic, and pompous in the extreme this album could only have been made and released in the 70's. As a (laughable) time capsule from that era it actually almost works, but as music it is nothing short of dreadful. Anyone who finds this stuff interesting needs to get out more."
"Positive","Volume 3: It's good to see the characters in a different setting. Rowan Atkisson plays a very different part in each of the four seasons. Great take on how to develop a series."
"Positive","Good Stuff: If your a Bob fan, you'll like the album. It's mostly older stuff that he performs live but has never put on a CD. There are a couple of good new originals."
"Negative","Poor workmanship: This bird feeder was put together in haste with poor quality wood. The maker scrimped on material for the roof. Small roof with no over-hang does not protect peanuts from the weather. It looks like this was done to accomodate shipping."
"Negative","Bad!: If you're a Bette Davis fan, skip this one. It will break your heart to see her this way. It was made fairly soon after her stroke and it is very apparent in this film. It is a story about two elderly sisters living together on a remote island. This movie fails to make any sense to me. It has a meandering story line going nowhere. I wish I had not seen it. The image of Bette Davis, in this one, will stay with me forever."
"Negative","The season of MI5 is dull and boring: Season 1 and 2 were amazing. This season was so dull I had to skip episodes (most particularly episode 7). I do not like Adam Carter nor his idiot wife. Tom, Zoe and Danny are a one of a kind team. I will definitely skip seasons 4-6 as it obviously looks very annoying. I'll be back with seasons 7 and 8 with Richard Armitage. This show is definitely rated on the actors they have chosen. Adam Carter and this team are very bad."
"Positive","Buffy Season 5: The DVD's are in good condition and arrived here within a week. I am very pleased with the prompt and quality service."
"Positive","Old school simple grand Bach: The 1950 performance of the Magnificat stands alone in its invididuality. Its simplicity naturally evokes its grandeur.The mono sound is acceptable and the singing is more operatic than sacred, but I guess that's the way things were done back in the day.The two Orchestral Suites included are from 1949 and are chamber like but with a profound intensity. Klemperer understands his Bach!Not a disc for everyone, only for serious Klemperer fans with a willing pocket for interest!"
"Negative","Use to be great stuff: I use to always buy the Capuccino Ice then stopped for about 6 months. When I purchased it again, it was renamed Capuccino and the recipe changed (looks like no caffeine). It now tastes just as bad as the rest of the protein shakes on the market. What happened? It use to taste great!!Get on the ball EAS and go back to the old recipe!!!"
"Negative","Aliens have abducted Chuck: Nothing like his other works. I loved ""Choke""...I loved ""Survivor."" Nine out of ten subjects blind folded and read ""Diary"" at bed time agree that it was written by Elizabeth Berg or Anne Tyler on crack. Two stars for the Foley bag. Although this is my least favorite to date, the man can write. I will be tackling the library clerk as she shelves his next book. My goal is to turn on more 42 year old mothers like myself on to this talent."
"Negative","A Poor Man's ""Moby Dick""....: As one previous reviewer wrote, ""WAY,WAY OVERRATED"". This somewhat meandering story didn't engage me, and like many readers, I found no compelling ending to Pi's journey. The emperor has no clothes...."
"Negative","Scooby Doo, What are you doing in this boring movie?: My son is a huge Scooby Doo fan,so we rushed out to buy this DVD and it was a big disappointment. The last movie (""Scooby Doo and the Alien Invaders"") was so much better. This one is just repetitive and tedious. I pretty much found it unwatchable. I realize that at 38, I'm not the target audience, but I've had no trouble sitting through the last two movies, over & over & over again with my kids. Save your money!"
"Negative","house beautiful: Zero stars - placed an order and needed to change the address after placing the order. That was about 4 weeks ago! Still waiting for my first magazine to arrive! So much for customer service!! I will probably not use Amazon again for a magazine subscription."
"Positive","Better than Dyce: This a great book that gets right to the point instead of dancing around it like dyce. I highly recommend it to all of my fellow vet students. It will save you tons of time!"
"Negative","Intermission . . . . on a DVD!!!!: Yes, it's true! I didn't believe it until I actually bought this copy of Goodfellas myself, but the production crew of this DVD were gracious enough to stick in their very own intermission in the middle of this 2 1/2 hour film. No, there wasn't one in the theatrical release, but there is an extraordinarily annoying and unnecessary one here. For in the middle of this incredibly entertaining movie it suddenly stops. The viewer must then get up and flip the DVD over to watch the second half of the film. !!!!NO KIDDING!!!! Why didn't Warner Brothers just release this on 8-track!!!! Totally unacceptable!!!! I actually thought I had received a bootleg copy through Amazon and requested an exchange . . . . but the joke is on me, because this is how the studio intended it for home viewing!!!! I highly recommend not purchasing this DVD, solely for this reason. I do LOVE the movie, but this is totally unacceptable!!!!"
"Negative","Characters lacked viewer sympathy.: I was interested in viewing the movie because of a newspaper review. I could not find a place to rent the movie in my area ofWhittier, California so I finally decided to buy the DVD.For the price I paid I was disappointed with the movie. I was hoping for more depth in the development of the characters and their relationship in the time prior to the baby kidnapping.I may need a second viewing to fully appreciate the story line and some empathy for the characters. Sometimes seeing a movie more than once creates a better appreciation of it.The good news is after several months of trying to find the movie to rent my quest is no over."
"Negative","Not worth the money: My Ipod never worked correctly, and when I tried to send it back they said the warranty was void because of a few microscopic dents in the casing. They wanted $255 plus tax for repair. How are you not going to get wear and tear on a product meant for being on the go?"
"Positive","Invaluable configuration and deployment reference book: A valuable one stop resource on JBoss configuration, administration, and deployment tasks. This handbook provided an organized presentation of information required to learn and implement JBoss. I wished though that MySQL should have been included in the chapter on JBossCX and Data Sources. Overall this material is a focused and great instant reference to those new to JBoss. Buyers of this book will highly appreciate any errata or updates be made available on the Wrox website. Thank you."
"Positive","Kindle2: My wife and I each have a Kindle2. If we want to read the same book or newspaper, we both have to download it or change Kindle2's. It should be possible to share things in archive with other Kindle2 owners in same household."
"Positive","The Craft & Art of Bamboo: Anyone who is interested in bamboo will want The Craft & Art of Bamboo by Carol Stangler readily at hand! She looked North and South, East and West for her resources and inspirations. And she knew who to include, some of the greats in the field of working with bamboo -- among them, David Flanagan (the Bamboo Fencer), Yucatan Bamboo, and Doug Lingen and Reed Hamilton of the Bamboosmiths. The reader may not need or be attracted to each project (with 30 in all, she offers a BIG range to choose from!), but there is a great deal of information to be gleaned from each one. The chapters on harvesting and tools alone are sufficiently full of information to make the very reasonable purchase price worthwhile. This would be a great gift, for yourself or for any woodworker-crafter."
"Negative","Oih.: I was forced into reading this book by my Language Arts teacher, as a comparison to Romeo and Juliet. The book had excellent discriptions, but I'm afraid thats it. The plot was dull, you couldn't get to know the characters at all, nor could you begin to understand them in any way whatsoever. I would have given it a 3 if it wasn't for the last sentence, which left me angry and irritated, I won't go into it incase someone else actually wants to read it to find out, though I suggest against it.Also, there are some fairly graphic scenes with discriptions that I really didn't want to read."
"Positive","Good Book: I enjoyed this book and the story was a fun read. I have finshed the other two books and have went on to read more of Mercedes Lackey's books. I'm sure her books will keep me buzzy for a while.S.Barnett"
"Negative","Designed By Marquis de Sade: This is one of the most annoying and badly designed machines of its kind.It is this side of un-cleanable.An odd size, but quick to do what it should do. But it is the aftermath!!!Cleaning it takes more time than preparing and cooking. And in the end, the cleaning is always difficult and usually unsatisfactory because of the silly and thoughtless design which must be by someone who has: 1. never cooked, and 2. never cleaned.This should only be sold at S&M; sandwich shops."
"Positive","One of JNHs better scores: It seems that M. Night Shyamalan brings out the best in James Newton Howard. All of my favorite scores written by the popoular composer are to films by that director: Unbreakable, Signs, The Village, and now Lady in the Water. This score has a great theme, and the last few tracks of score are phenomenal. There are a few songs tacked on at the end which I don't care for--all covers of Bob Dylan songs, I think. If you've liked Unbreakable or the Village, you'll like this one too. It's on the level with those. Probably better than the former, not quite a good as the latter."
"Negative","Total rubbish: What people see in this films beggers belief. The story is ridiculous and the acting is daft. I'd give it no stars if I could."
"Positive","great product: I have used products from this company in the past, so I went with them again and it is working great for me again. I would recommend this product."
"Positive","Sad Eyes: I hope they show the ""Sad Eyes"" episode here. It's one of the cutest episodes, in which Lizzie gets a job and learns that work is really hard, and also learns a lesson about the value of $. It starts when she asks for a raise in allowance, looking really cute and begging her mom and dad, smiling oh so sweetly, and then when her mom disagrees, resorting to the sad eyes. How can you say no to the sad eyes? But her mom did, and off storms Elizabeth Brooke who is determined to prove to her parents that she can be responsible and earn her own money. Classic episode."
"Negative","christina slaguilera: Like OMG this girl like needs to get a life, she has like noooooooo fashion sense and she like totally needs to re do her hairstyle, like hello get a grip reality girlfriend!!! i really just need to say that although she has an average singing voice she really needs to like sort out all of her other aspects in like life and take a rain check on her album and 'pop star' career at the moment. i also think that like she sees herself as a pop princess but then tries to be like justin and does like all the r n b music that is basically like 'OMG you really need to get out more girlfriend and see like what the normal people of the world like and want to hear, and not what you think that your mum would like .... ok!!!!!!!!!"
"Negative","boring: This movie is boring. Everytime I try to watch this movie I get the same result: boring. I don't know what other reviewers see that gave it 5 stars; because this movie is awful. From beginning to end competely dreadful."
"Negative","Splash guard too high for a girl: We started with this potty earlier than the recommended 24 months and our daughter was too short for the splash guard and it would poke her in the bum whenever she tried to sit down. She is now almost 24 months (as recommended by the manufacturer) and it's still a pain. In addition, the seat tips easily when she's trying to lower herself on and slides around all over the tile (bathroom) floor when she's getting on and off. A waste of plastic for our shortish, chubby-thighed girl."
"Positive","Flexible, weighted, lets out a great stream of bubbles and looks great!: I am very happy with this flexible bubble wand. I have it in a 4' long 55 gallon tank and it provides a beautiful curtain of large and small mist like bubbles ... assuming you have a really good airpump. I purchased the Whisper 100 and it is doing a horrible job but one of my other pumps does a great job with this wand. Definitely worth having if you want good surface agitation to increase O2 levels in the tank and the fish love to swim through it. Also, with it being flexible you can put it in and out of objects, all around the tank, around objects, start at the front and end at the back. Whatever you want. It is weighted nicely but still needs some gravel coverage to keep it in place - especially if you have Koi or other fish that like to move the gravel around."
"Positive","Good Item, Fast Shipping.: What can i say. It's micro-'soft' They try to get you any way they can. I bought this for my son, i figured getting the year membership is a better deal. Shipping was fast, received item two days later..awesome. thanks amazon."
"Negative","MUCH ADDO ABOUT NOTHING !: Much has been said about this book. But, like a great number of French writers costumely do, this book is written in a boring narrative."
"Negative","Very uncomfortable: In the past 2 weeks I invested in 10 different pairs of winter boots from Amazon and Sierra Trading Post.These boots are so uncomfortable to wear that my legs started to ache right through.The stiffness was overwhelming as there is no give in the lifting of the foot motion to simply walk.They are also rather heavy as well so the weight and stiffness makes you aware of every step you take.As soon as I took them off the aching subsided and was gone in 5 minutes.Because I finally have winter boots for the first time in my life the novelty will take years to wear off.But these boots will be used only in the worst conditions as to not ruin any of my other boots.Because I live in Australia, postage to return them would cost me more than I paid for the boots and it's not Amazon's fault so I shall keep them."
"Positive","What's the date?: This was a 1st time experience, buying a watch online. Overall, the watch is what I was looking for, and I have already ordered another one.My only criticism is the face, all be it quite large, is very hard to read. My eyes aren't what they once were, but I should be able to make it out."
"Positive","Yukon Game Gambrel: I purchased a Yukon Game Gamble about 2 months ago prior to the Kentucky upcoming deer season. During my hunt, I killed a large 10 point buck with a bow and used the Yukon Game Gamble to hang the animal from a rafter in a barn in order to field dress and process the animal. This item was so easy to use and will allow one person to manage hanging an animal that weighed around 160 - 180 lbs with little to no effort. The instructions were very clear and the item works flawlessly. This is definitely an item every hunter needs. I will recommend this to all my hunting buddies and friends. Thanks Yukon.... Rick"
"Negative","hated it!: returned this item because: although the earbuds produced enough bass it was at the expense of clear highs. bought a ten dollar pair of phillips @ a drug store that were much better sounding."
"Negative","2 & 1/2 stars; pleasant, but uninspired: It's not that this is a BAD book, it's just ordinary. It does, however, have some nice moments and interesting characters. As the other reviewer noted, the huge surprise was not treated as a significant event, but I found nothing wrong with the ending otherwise.There were awkward moments and subplots not fully explained or left to dangle, but overall it was a fairly pleasant read -- especially at a season when so few books are worth cracking open."
"Positive","Haunting: I had seen the film, but it was a long time ago, so instead of buying the dvd I bought the book.If you only read one book this year, make it this one.If you only read one book in your life, make it this one.Five stars is not enough."
"Positive","A bit of a shock, but it is signature Alec Empire!: When I got Alec Empire's new cd, The Futurist, I was shocked that it was full of guitars and not the usual ""sampled guitars"" and uber-heavy distorted electronic beats I love Digital Hardcore for. But, after a second listen, I am hooked to this CD!! The stand out tracks for me are Kiss of Death (#1) and Vertigo (#6). If you are sick and tired of the cliched punk scene and the every growing boring electronic scene, check out The Futurist. Trust me, you will see the future and it doesn't look all that good! At least you can thrash to it with impunity!"
"Positive","brand new item like described netgear WGE111: EXCELLENT ITEM BUT I DIDN'T NEED IT. SO I RETURNED IT AND THIS COMPANY WAS GREAT DID THE RETURN NO PROBLEMS"
"Positive","Kills roaches, after a time.: Bought a shortsale home which had a large roach problem in the kitchen. I spread this amply in the corners of cabinets, floors, behind the stove, under the sink, and on the countertop where it meets the wall (wherever I thought there could be an entryway or a path for the roaches). It DOES take a while, several weeks. It's been a month since I've used this and in the past 2 weeks I haven't seen a single roach, compared to seeing 3-4 a day."
"Positive","Read this one aloud: The rhythm of sentence fragments, lists of images, occasional insertion of a farsical headline, harsh purity of the characters. You can't help like Quoyle and his daughters, Sunshine and Bunny, in spite of their ordinariness. You can't help fall into the dialect of the Newfoundland fishermen and the reporters who, with Quoyle, prepare The Shipping News. Fun to read. Anxious approach to each new chapter. Waves on the shores. Boats capsizing. Bodies floating. What will happen to Quoyle tonight? Man Finds Romance Reading Aloud to Wife"
"Positive","Amazing: This is a surprising small yet full of addreses. The only problem is that infrequently it gives the directions as if you are coming from the opposit direction"
"Negative","Unpleasant Reading: As a Troggs fan, I was thrilled to see a biography had hit the shelves. I bought it immediately. Joy soon turned to disappointment as I struggled to decipher the totally convoluted syntax filling these pages. Sentences go on and on and on, packed with references so obscure, I couldn't read it for more than a couple minutes at a time. And I'm very familiar with 60's British slang and culture. The book is still worth laboring through if you're a big Troggs fan, but be prepared for a difficult slog."
"Positive","VCR makes too much noise: The TV and DVD fuctions are great. The only problem I have is when I watch a VHS there is a loud hum while a tape is inside (Playing or not) the unit. That hum makes it impossible to covertly watch an adult movie without getting caught by your spouse. Also, when you hit stop the unit makes a loud noise. The DVD portion is quiet and the transition back to a cable channel is fast and soundless. Bottom Line. If you are watching something you don't your wife to know about use the DVD. Still a good buy for a bedroom TV. I also have it hooked up to my mini sound system and it looks and sounds great."
"Negative","41 inches: I bought this because it was one of the few gates that seemed like it would fit my 42 inch opening. Nope...good for 41 inches, but not 42. Sent it back."
"Positive","Fast, Furious, and Fascinating: This is a wonderful mystery thriller with many twists and turns to keep the reader guessing. Once you start you will find it difficult to put this one down. Definately worth your time."
"Positive","Great for Beginners: First off, this book is for TRUMPET.The ""Essential Elements 2000: A Comprehensive Band Method"" is a great book for a young person who is learning an instrument for the first time. There is a fingering chart in the back of the book to make looking up fingerings quick and easy. The book starts off very basic with the parts of the instrument. The easiest notes to play and finger are presented first with exercises to practice them. This book comes with a play-along CD. This CD includes all solo exercises.Hal Leonard also offers (though not through Amazon) band sets for band directors. They are simple arrangements of music that correlate with the book. They are great for the first concert.There is an older version of this book called ""Essential Elements: A Comprehensive Band Method"". The book is purple and has many of the same features as this one, but the CDs have to purchased separately."
"Negative","dissappointed: After following directions perfectly, my ice cream didn't work.If there is something that I am not doing, please let me know.I would love to use this for my extended family, but don't want more embarrassment.I also have a milk sensitivity and would like to try some milk substitutes since I still love ice cream.Thanks for any help or input.J Brown"
"Positive","A Must Have Drill: I have used this Bosch drill for a few months now and love it. To go along with the drill I also bought the Clic-Change, hex screwdriver bits, and hex shank drill bits. The Clic-Change makes life a whole lot easier by being able to switch bits quickly. The drill is small enough to fit in places that others can not. Plus, the weight and balance is such that you can drill all day without fatigue. The Bluecore battery charges in just minutes. I have also dropped the drill a couple of times and it hardly has a scratch on it. I also really love the 2 speeds. The first speed is for screws and the higher speed is for drilling holes. The 2 speeds match perfectly to the job. I highly recommend this Bosch drill."
"Negative","A bizarre record: Pierre Henry's electronics sound very abrasive. I like a lot of the musique concrete records from Nonesuch like Stockhausen and Xenakis, but I haven't warmed to this. I guess I was expecting things to...gell more. From a prog-rock perspective, I actually prefer both of the Electric Prunes releases more than this because the David Axelrod production is so crisp and clear. As another entry in a short-lived experimental, and somewhat lost era of rock, perhaps it is worth another listen."
"Positive","Excellent, and does what it's supposed to do: Although I would have appreciated a little more explanation of JavaScript concepts, this book works as advertised. And for $18, it can't be beat."
"Positive","fast food is no better than fast sex ;0): This movie makes you feel going Mc donald's (for fast food) just as much guilty as going to a brothel (for fast sex). I think we do need to respect our food so that we can respect our own body. In short, you should build a strong and healthy relationship with your food but not a FAST one. Although Fast food might taste really good and have lots of choices to pick from, be faithful to your body.I think the documentary movie makes its points very clear. ""Must watch"" but I won't own it."
"Negative","not an author children should read: Mr Whittle is a skilled writer. However his fiction should be written for adults, where the problems won't affect impressionable minds.The first thing that disturbed me was the poor English of Quon Lee. While those learning English as adults might have difficulty pronouncing certain sounds that their native language don't contain, this would not be the case with a little boy. It's not true that ""Chinese tongues"" are unable to make the l sound, etc. Add that to the portrayal of the Jewish tailor as always whining, you get ""old-fashioned"" in the bad sense of the term.Then Lizzy was involved in smuggling, in effect stealing from the government & those obeying the law. Then blackmail. It's not OK to blackmail someone even when that someone isn't a good person.And I certainly don't think that people kept in a barrel would be alive at the end of a week. They either would starve, die of thirst, or suffocate. Maybe not all, but at least some."
"Negative","International National Kit: I took this on a small fishing boat trip since it was an inner bag which featured a leakproof, waterproof and airtight seal. My small fishing boat took on water and I was swimming for land. Fortunately the lightweight outer bag survived.Upon opening it, many items were out of date or just didn't work, like the band-aids, medical tape and oinkment. This Kit is also not fireproof as I found out when I fell asleep by my campfire and it caught fire."
"Negative","POS: This is by far the worst product I have ever bought. It came with no guide on how to use it and there is no phone number to call when you are having a problem. You have to email the company and then pray that they send you your activation code, and if they don't (which is what happened to me) oh well, out of luck. And come to find out you cant even use it to convert regular dvd's and it isnt even compatible with my Zune player.save your money and get something else!!!"
"Negative","Rubbish: More of the same rubbish from the lunatic fringe who deny the scientific evidence of evolution. Watch only for more of the same perverse entertainment trotted out by these morons."
"Negative","Ice Not Nice: Being that the doors at my place of work are constantly open, humid and hot air is always lingering. Ice bandana seemed like a good idea to help me keep cool. In less than 2 hours, the ever-so-slight cooling stopped; my shifts are a minimum of 4 hours. Also, the tie in the front of the bandana looks ""dorky"" - something I'd be willing to overlook if the product worked. Even during the first hour, the bandana didn't fit snugly against the skin because the ice insert is stiff. This product is a huge disappointment and a waste of money. It's best to keep searching for something else; even if you find nothing, you won't have lined the pockets of the companies who sell this product."
"Positive","classic: Barrowman has the perfect voice for Cole Porter's music. Beautiful!I wish his rendition of Night and Day had been included, but probably it is reserved for the soundtrack album of the movie Delovely."
"Negative","sippy cups are not for chardonnay and this books is not for laughs!: I purchased this book based on the reviews. Not as funny as other reviewers say. I kept reading the book in hopes if it getting better. I was very disappointed."
"Positive","Truly Unique: Unlike anything done before or since.Imagine, if you will, Pretty Hate Machine, on happy pills, sped up a bit, with a truly massive and very harmonic sonic landscape (i.e. lots of sounds filling up your ears), and the angellic, yet edgy voice of Toni Halliday. Someone else has called it ""techno"". Not far off. Rock? Could be. Indie? Showgazer? Alternative? Yes. And no. All of these, and more.I've had this for 13 years, and it's been a favourite the whole time. Just buy it. Buy it now. You will love it.And if you can, get the single of Fait Accompli. They remixed it for the single and it is, improbably, better than the album version."
"Negative","A slasher with gusto: Can you believe this movie is Francis Ford Coppola, and produced by Roger Corman? Nether can the viewer. I am not sure how it made it to film. However it has collector value.Dementia 13 is not a bad movie; it is a little dark in more ways than one. The just is nothing significant about it other than a few hacker scenes.We find our self in a Castle with a murderer who is bumping every one off. The question is ""who done it?""Was it Lizzie Borden or Jeffery Dalmer?Maybe it was mommy?Or the mad doctor?Who knows?This movie makes a good addition to slasher movies and it is not as mindless as most.Apocalypse Now - The Complete Dossier (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)"
"Negative","Talking cars: Horrible idea. Worse with no organization.: In ways I felt the same about this movie as I did with Gnomeo and Juliet. It is just terrible and not organized. I think a reasonable car movie would be something involving all of the NASCAR races on ESPN and ESPN 2 with real people in the cars racing them and do the animation that way. I hate it when there are talking cars.Cars aren't meant to talk. They are meant to drive and stop when supposed to without talking. This is my opinion. Just because you don't think this is right doesn't mean it's not helpful. Be kind."
"Positive","Great book !: This is a fantastic cookbook with great recipes and beautiful pictures. I would recommend to all."
"Positive","Lew, the blues singing postman: I heard ""Iv'e been cheated"" on XM and bought the CD. This is a great CD but it is not what you would call Chicago or Detroit Blues. This is Kentucky blues sung with a drawl and excellent guitar work. The pace is slower and there isn't anything hard rock about the music. My suggestion, go to YouTube and listen to Cheated, then Tattoo Blues and that should be enough for you to decide. This in not Buddy Guy but it is great blues and excellent guitar."
"Positive","Good start to a Wales based mystery series.: Three policemen try to unravel first the identity and then the reason for the murder of a woman found hanged near 'Gallows Cottage'.The men have an uneasy and at times bickering association. There is much of interest in the locale and characters involved. I found the book to be enjoyable and am anxious to read Mrs. Taylor's next installment. She is a good writer with strong beliefs who expresses all the petty and serious discontents faced by ""Everyman"".The mystery is inhabited by familiar ghosts. Mrs. Taylor observes of one character, who has left his wife and alienated most others around him that, ""...he waited for Death, the only visitor likely to call."" A thoughtful mystery with more than murder on its mind."
"Negative","Eraserhead: I saw this film while in college. Some group sponsored it and charged $1 admission. How could you go wrong for a buck? When the lights came back on I not only wanted my dollar back, I wanted the two hours of my life back. What a pretentious, self-indulgent pile of crap!As we filed out of the lecture hall I overheard someone say that it was ""brilliant"". I don't think this guy knew what the hell he just sat through and, figuring if he didn't understand it, it must be genius. I wanted to punch him in the face."
"Positive","This thing is fantastic!: I read the previous reviews and ordered a SpotBot, which arrived last week. I cannot believe how good it works! It took care of (excuse my candor) cat vomit stains from an off-white and a mauve carpet, with no problem. (We have three cats with stomachs that must be more delicate than the garden-variety kitty, because it seems like they do it alot....)We also used the SpotBot to remove a dark stain that was left on the mauve carpeting by the leg of a brass bed - it was really deep and imbedded. I was amazed!This cleaner isn't for all-over carpet cleaning. But it is wonderful for little (and not so little) spots and stains, without using elbow grease! And the price from Amazon (with $$$ off and free shipping) was about $25 less than I could buy it for from our local Wal-Mart)I'll never put off cleaning up those stains again!I am so satisfied!"
"Positive","Great Basic Mouse: I needed a basic mouse to compliment my wireless mouse. This works great. No problems. comfortable in the hand. Using with my mac laptop."
"Positive","Martex Desert Horizon Reversible bed in bag: The idea of using two designs on the sheets was interesting, the top and bottom halves of each sheet were each different. The quality of the fabric was good for the money: 2 sheets, 2 pillow cases,2 shams, bed shirt and comforter"
"Positive","Wish it was bigger: Pre-seasoned is always the way to go. Thank you Lodge for the innovation! This means clean-up is easy and you have a huge head start on seasoning.I like the grill press because it helps my food cook faster and it does keep things flat. The cast iron makes it nice and heavy. My only regret is that it isn't bigger. Mario Batali seems to have correctly figured out the press-to-pan ratio.The press is still a good buy."
"Positive","A nice electric kettle: I had this kettle for about a month and have been very satisfied with it. I use it at work, and have it right on my desk. No smells, it's quick, takes up very little space, and is fairly atractive.I gave it four, rather than five, stars because it's a little larger than I'd like, I would have perfered all stainless steel, and the cord is about 2"" too short to reach a power strip on the floor when placed on a typical desk."
"Positive","deep and moving: I heard this from a friend and then bought my own. It is a moving piece with other sounds than just voice. You can feel the deep intensity and it is different than some other native pieces."
"Negative","Terrible vacuum: This is the worst vacuum I have ever owned. It is so time consuming with the filters clogging up so fast and then having to clean them several times before it over heats and shuts off. You can't vacuum half the living room without it shutting off and that's with clean filters. This vacuum is junk! My 20 year old Eureka canister is better than this vacuum. I just replaced this Shark with a Dirt Devil Breeze and the Dirt Devil is far superior in suction. The Dirt Devil picked up an unbelievable amount more dirt and dog hair than the Shark did when it was new. The Shark was a complete waste of money."
"Positive","FANTASTIC SNOW SHOVEL: I bought this shovel 3 years ago and never needed to use it until this weekend. With 24"" of snow, it was definitely put to the test. Each time that I went to clear the drive, I would wait until at least 4-6"" of snow was on the ground. This shovel saved so much time and so much back pain! It cleaned up quite well, there was a light scattering of snow left behind, but you would find that using a regular shovel, too. It throws the snow forward, so you need to plan out the path that you'll be shoveling - you don't want to throw snow onto an area that you just cleaned up. I was the envy of my neighbors ... so many people asked me where I bought it and I directed them to Amazon.com.I never thought that I'd enjoy shoveling 24"" of snow, but I did!"
"Positive","A book every woman should read: My daughter suggested I read this book and I was so glad that I did. I never realized how as a woman I should listen to my instincts."
"Positive","Canon Speedlite: This product shipped very quickly. It came new in the box with great packing and everything is stated it would."
"Negative","Only one side sharpened?: I am giving two stars because either they forgot to grind one of the sides, or because this is a left handed only knife and they did not put it in the product discription. I am not left handed so I can not use it!**Update** I wish I could give zero stars for this, worst possible option for a neck knife, totally and completely useless!"
"Negative","disappointing: Sigh. I loved Secret Life of Bees and was really looking forward to this book but it falls flat, in my humble opinion. I am not done with it yet (am on page 205--can anyone tell me it gets better?) but the writing and characters, and the setting and plot do not measure up with the drama of Secret Life. So far in the book, the main protagonists, Jessie and Whit, are so shallow and cliche, their arguments for breaking their respective vows are not convincing. Jessie separates from her husband in a conversation that took about two paragraphs and he went running back to the mainland....that just seemed weird to me. There are some ""sort of"" interesting characters, Kat and Hepzibah for example, but they are not enough to save the book. I am going to soldier on to see how it ends, but it is painful. The author had a real problem here in that Secret Life was a tough act to follow. Ms. Kidd should stick with chronological adolescents, not middle aged people acting like adolescents."
"Positive","New Meaning to Multi-Tasking!: Mimi O'Bara gives new meaning to multi-tasking. I recognize her family! This book hits home and is a must read for women who think the balls in the air are hitting them on their heads too often. Order two; one for you and one as a gift to give your career colleague who is also super mom and adoring wife and thinks no one understands her plight. Nothing takes the sting out of a bad day better than a good laugh. Mimi O'Bara provides more humor than the Comedy Channel. Kick off those heels and give yourself a fun break. This book made me laugh more than I can explain."
"Negative","Ouch!: I bought this because I thought it would be fun to see Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland in their older years. Not to mention Ceaser Romero.....but man oh man what a stinker of a script. Don't bother."
"Negative","Okay as a clipper - horrible for a clean shave - doesn't work wet: This product works okay as a dry clipper for those places where you just want to trim. However, it doesn't work wet as advertised - the hair gets matted and the combs don't catch it. For anywhere you want a clean shave (chest, back, etc), the foil doesn't work AT ALL, wet or dry. It doesn't remove any hair the length that the shortest comb leaves. Also, the pop-up trimmer (which I used for my neckline and sideburns) gets rid of hair, but it irritates, and can even draw blood. Overall, a pretty junky product."
"Negative","A big yawn!: The bottom line: What's wrong with caring for all beings on this planet? Before you chow down on that drumstick, think good and hard about where it came from.Have some mercy people and for once, think beyond yourself!"
"Positive","Absolutely love it: We use this to cook veggies and smaller meat items like shrimp on our grill/smoker. It's heavy duty made, super easy to clean, and the food doesn't fall through it. It also heats evenly which is great. Going to get another to keep in with our camping supplies.Only con is to be careful of the edges and corners as they are rather sharp."
"Negative","Even DieHards Fan Can Skip: i was hoping for something a little different for diehard wz fans. unfortunately, the quality of musicianship leaves much to be desired, and i have listened to this piece of trash just once. if you need a warren fix, i would suggest purchsing the VH1 special and then play his masterpiece, ""warren zevon."""
"Negative","Not terrible...: After hearing about this when it was being promoted on the Howard Stern show I decided to pick one up. The shaver itself has a nice comfortable design. However, as noted in other reviews, the guides are awful. They do not do a good job of guiding the hair to the blades, making your trimming look uneven and sloppy. Another problem I have had is when trimming without the guides the blade unit has a tendecy to pop right out of the shaver. Sure it easily snaps back into place, but itis annoying and can easily mess up what you are doing. This product is a great idea, but something really needs to be done about how well it works with the guides, as I don't always want to go down to bare skin."
"Negative","Pioneer 578 - not for DVD-A: I picked up a unit from Best Buy, and it worked swell for about 26 days.For some unknown reason, the audio playing from DVD-Audio discs suddenly sounded as if was coming from underwater. The odd audio only occurred in 5.1. When playing the same DVD-A discs in stereo, the audio sounded normal.5.1 SACD discs played without a problem, as did DVD-Video discs. From some of the other reviews, it appears there are those that didn't experience any problems.If you desire to purchase this unit, I'd advise buying it locally in case you need to return it if turns out to be defective. I had to return mine and ended up purchasing a Sony DVD/SACD changer instead."
"Positive","Going fast and trimming brass!: The Lyman case trimmer with pilots has been one of the best reloading tools I've purchased. Everything works smooth and leaves a good finished edge to reload."
"Positive","The Best on Swings: This book is the best book on Swings that I have come across that provides solutions to issues and problems that a Swings GUI developer faces while developing real world applications."
"Positive","very cool: Knowing the 10GB model is being phased out by Apple for the 15GB model I recently purchased one at the relative bargain price being offered by Amazon. I seriously doubt I need even close to 10GB for music - but never say never.I have a PC so I was a little leary - and I did have one hurdle to cross - my PC was operating on Windows 98 so I had to upgrade to WindowsXP to use the Ipod. The upgrade was painless and the new operating system is a major improvement.As for the Ipod the directions could be much clearer and for this I take away one star. All in all the ipod works as billed; it sounds great and the design is very functional, and it looks really cool. I really like this unit a lot - but, while (after some experimentation)I can load the music I want I still believe that there must be an easier way that I will eventually discover and the directions really are lacking in this area."
"Positive","Witty, Wise, and Accessible: This is quite simply the best introduction to eastern religions I have ever seen. It treats Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Jainism, Shinto -- and even Tantra. It is full of cogent information, examples, and lots of humor. Diane Morgan has the gift of making even the most abstruse concepts clear and entertaining. For those in a hurry, an audiotape is also available. This is a must read!"
"Negative","Mediocre Battle-of-the-Horns: Although a few of the tracks seem inspired, it's mainly Mulligan going through the motions with Getz, with very little chemistry between them. ""Anything Goes"" and ""Scrapple From the Apple"" are nice enough but beyond that it's weak. Mulligan himself didn't speak very highly of the recording session, saying that he enjoyed his other dates with Desmond, Webster, and Hodges, but mentioning that ""Granz wanted that session a lot more than I did."" Of course, it would be quite out of the ordinary to hear anything but negative remarks about Stan Getz and his sparkling personality. Save your money and go buy the 2-disk reissue of ""Meets Ben Webster"". Or, if you don't have it already, the seminal Pacific recordings with Chet Baker."
"Negative","Meh: Fast paced, but I never developed a connection with the character. I got about half way through it and if felt more like a job than a book."
"Positive","English for nincompoops: This book is very, very funny. It's a real rarity, a reference book that you can read from cover to cover in one session.Leo Rosten, does the subject justice and keeps his timeless style intact covering this fascinating and esoteric world of <AngloSachs> faith, foklore, tradition, genious and history through a cute study of Yiddish philology..."
"Positive","Solid Performer: I purchased this lawn mower in 2003 and it's worked well but finally died (2008)(I'm fairly sure the thermal circuit breaker finally went out). This lawn mower was stored in an unheated garage during bitter cold Minnesota winters, yet battery power remained reasonable until it just died.I've always preferred electric lawn mowers over gas ones. It's nice to use a maintenance free product.This mower did have difficulties in deep grass (and I mean really deep - like two feet high) and never really had enough battery power to cut a full 3/4 acre. I would say on average it can cut just about a half acre on a single charge.The wheels became a bit wobbly over the past year but still worked fine."

"Positive","A must read for the artist!: This book is exactly what the title says it is a Legal Guide for the Visual Artist. I wouldn't say the wording is the easiest or most interesting--it is law--but it definitely seems to be written in a way so that the artist can understand it. As someone who stumbles over law, I appreciated this book. The guide provides examples of forms that might be needed and gives examples of famous cases that have occurred with pictures to help in understanding them. The book is very helpful and pretty up to date, covering not only the older forms of art like painting and sculpture, but also new forms like digital imagery. As an artist, if you are going to get one art law book, buy this one."
"Negative","Blacked out Black light: I purchased this blacklight for its small portability. It arrived quickly and well packaged. It just did not work well at all. It sizzled and burned out when the batteries were inserted. I received an unexpected quick refund."
"Negative","LIES AND LIARDS: I NEVER GOT THIS ITEM, AND AMAZON OR THE SELLER NEVER RESPONDED TO MY COMPLAININTS ... I AM NEVER BUYING FROM AMAZON EVER AGAIN."
"Negative","The structure: Upon reading the book ""Chinese Eunuchs The Structure of Intimate Politics"", by Mr. Taisuke Mitamura, i found the structure to be very unorganized and at times, hard to follow. Given, the book starts off well, with vivid descriptions of what a eunuch was and how they became eunuchs, but in the later chapters the book, (or at least i felt) went off tangent. What i mean is that it began to describe the roles of ""fearsome wives"" and then into the ""Yellow Age"". Maybe i missed the essence (albeit i read the book very quickly) but i thought the focus was in the role of eunuchs in intimate politics."
"Negative","its actually 3.5: 3.5, but i gave it 2 because the other guy gave it 5, so its to balance out.too much big sugar influencetoo funkybut stil good"
"Negative","Horrible! I beg you not to waste your money!: Calling this a book is perhaps too kind. I use that term only because it is in the physical shape of a book i.e., words arranged on paper bound together with glue.How this 'book' ever got published is beyond me. Maybe Henrick has one of those nasty high-tech guns pointed at the head of the publisher. Why is it so horrible? Let me count the ways: 1. It's poorly written. 2. You don't believe the characters. 3. The situations are ridiculous.If I was one of the people who contributed to this travesty of a 'book' I would ask to have my name removed from the credits.The only reason I kept reading it was for the perverse pleasure of exclaiming, ""Oh my God! Is he kidding? That's the stupidest thing I've ever read!"" Please, for the love of all things good, don't read this book."
"Positive","jackie at his best: this movie has been done by everybody so there are no surprises but there is something about jackie chan. great movie....id buy it again"
"Negative","Nice start for beginners: I saw a pattern from Hollywood Knits in the Winter 2002 Knits mag. It was super simple, but the style of it elevated it above your typical, dowdy beginner pattern. Liking that pattern, I took a look at this book in a yarn shop. I was not that impressed with the look of any of the other designs. Were I a beginner, I would want to knit one of Suss's designs for a beginner project, but after that I would want to move on to more techniques. If you are not a beginner, you could probably knit any of the projects just by looking at them, without reading the directions. The designs are that simple and straightforward. Unfortunately, most of the designs are not elegantly simple, they are just plain simple. As in Girl Scout troup. On the other hand, Suss uses great yarns, many of which I was not aware of and would really like to get my hands on."
"Negative","The Girlfriend's Guide Bombs: This book was very negative. Thank goodness I read it when I was far along in my pregnancy or I would have been dreading it instead of loving it. Your attitude can make or break a pregnancy and Iovine's book doesn't do much to help give you a positive one. I didn't learn anything new and disagreed with her views on exercise, weight gain and labor. There are many books available. Don't settle for this one."
"Positive","Too bad this has turned into a political debate area...: Unfortunately, most of these reviews don't actually review the movie as much as they declare reviewers' political affiliations. If you take a step back, Michael Moore has compiled a documentary that raises key questions and highlights current issues. Wether you agree with him or not is your business, however as a documentary, this is well put together and extremely thought provoking. It is compiled mostly from released documents, news segments and historical facts, some of which seem to be questionable to the population at large. It's an important documentary to see, if for no other reason, to be able to discuss it or disbute it intelligently."
"Positive","Fun: My dogs loved this toy, comes with a replacement squeaker but my dogs quickly pierced both.Now we just have an empty ducky."
"Negative","AMATEURS ONLY!!!!!!!: I was given this book by someone with the most sincere intentions...Opening it was was giddy.. i was in my car and almost crashed trying to read of new positions and take my sex life to the next level...I'm not sure what pulled the other reviews in and why they are so excited about this book because it was one HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. Half this stuff is obvious... the other half is really ridiculous. I'm assuming the target audience is for women who are pretending to be a lesbian - or maybe those who want to sample it out bc their husband is interested in a 3some...for the hardcore lesbian who has had a time rolling around in teh sack - this isnt the book for you. Been there done that... its not going to take you to the next level.. at all. You're imagination is alot better than this book. Its for amateurs and belongs in a photography book. Only positive is the pictures are beautiful in an artistic kind of way. Who needs art when she is trying to get a girl sprung?"
"Positive","Some important articles but the collection is rather dated.: This is a useful collection of articles on the historical origins of the Qur'an, many of which are hard, for the non-specialist, to track down. The very small number of similar publications available on the market makes this an important book. However, the material included is rather old, to say the least, with virtually nothing from the last fifty years of scholarship, when important advances have been made. It is a shame, for example, that we are not given any ""classic"" introductions dealing with some recent discoveries, such as the early variant forms of the Qur'an found in the 70s in Yemen. It is also rather sad that, given the enormous number of critical (in the best sense of the word) studies of Christian and Jewish religious texts, that the articles included here do not make use of the plethora of historical tools that these, comparable works, have made available to the modern scholar."
"Negative","Hoover F5300 Floormax: Problems encounter: Had to guess work on what pads to use, directions weren't clear and no instructions on how to install the pads. The container that holds the cleaning solution doesn't snap in -- had to push in with the palm of my hands which got pinched. The container that holds the cleaning solution is not as large as the other reviewers made it seem (Maybe, a gallon). The machine itself is awkward to handle, the bottom is heavy and when lifting doesn't lock in the upright position. Which slammed on my hardwood floor and ceramic tiles due to the heavy motor. The lack of instructions on how to probably use the enclosed attachments (pads), assembly and the non-lock upright feature has made this product a disappointment. I was ready to send it back but will give it a second try now that I figured out the problem areas. As for the cleaning, don't know, will give it another try."
"Negative","No more Combo routers for me: The router I received is great with the fixed base. The motor won't fit into the plunge base, and the plunge base came with a broken sub-base. I should have gone with the dedicated plunge router. DeWalt deserves a black eye for their lack of Product QA."
"Negative","untitled: Christina Aguilera is so Dirrty She gonna need a bath. This song is disgusting and has anyone seen the video? it's even worse"
"Negative","Commerical, generic garbage for aging hippies.: Who still listens to this junk? First, she isn't even hot. Who listens to ugly female singers? Listen to true beauties like Jessica Simpson. Hot = talent. Second, this album is like 1000 years old. It never even got any BET airplay! An artist is only good if they're on BET. Third, this is commerical, generic garbage! It was overproduced, too commercial and Patti's voice was generated through a computer. What you're hearing is basically a machine making this pathetic excuse for ""music"". She even tried making a rap song (""Redondo Beach""). Wow, Patti, give it up. You'll never be as good as 50 Cent. Sorry."
"Negative","If you like Schlock, you'll love this film.: It's got everything from cheezy effects,(a pitiful dragon puppet,) to cheezy dialogue as well. I'd be surprised if Mystery Science Theatre 3000 doesn't take this one on. It's set in the Ireland, so at least you get to see some nice country side."
"Negative","My dog didn't play with it or chew it at all: I think my dog thought it was too heavy and didn't like the texture so I couldn't get her to play with it."
"Negative","Do not buy this mirror-its buld won't last for 3 months.: You purchased this item on February 12, 2009.Do not buy this mirror-its buld won't last for 3 months."
"Positive","A thoughtful gift: Bought several of these tie bars for gifts to my husbands wait staff at the restaurant he manages. Useful and still attractive."
"Positive","This is a preemprtive ""shh"". THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!: The lines are the best. Although the average person may think this movie to be somewhat silly, it is those of who enjoy a good spoof that will take it for what it is meant to be, FUNNY!! Mike Myers is great in this and So I Married an Ax Murderer. I highly recommend both."
"Negative","Picture Is Not Accurate: If you like the way the frame looks in the picture you will be sadly disappointed when it arrives. The picture they shows that there is not matte around the screen. when you receive yours it is large, bulky, has a 3/4 inch matte around the frame that looks cheap, plus the frame appears to be put together buy someone with poor craftsmanship. I purchased one of these frames [...] and they screwed me over on the deal. I just want everyone to be aware that your item will not look like this picture."
"Negative","TERRIBLE: I hooked the player up and in 5 min it died. The picture started scrambling and then it never showed anything on the screen after that. I have to return it now and speaking with ""ritzcamera"" customer support is almost to hard to even get my refund. Absolutly brutal experience. Its only $50 so I am thinking I am just going to give up. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."
"Negative","Old box with oxidized and broken lock.: I paid for a beautiful gift like the picture but i got an article that looked used! The white paint was yellowish. It's a old box with oxidized and broken lock. I throw away the cookies because don't have expiration date."
"Positive","Fast track to learning Portuguese: This is hands down the best tool for the beginner to learn Portuguese. Portuguese is definitely not a language that as a beginner, one would want to delve to deeply into. The grammar structure can be daunting and the phonetics can be daunting as well.Pimsleur, however, goes straight to the point and has the learner conversing by the end of 30 mintues!The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the price. Learning a language should be fun and educational, not a privilege available only to the rich. I was lucky enough to find this in a library. Many people may not be so lucky. They may have to be left struggling with outdated and poorly written books that are too complex and too frustrating for the beginning student.If you can afford it, or even better, borrow it, I highly recommend this program! Portuguese is a very beautiful language and just think of all the fun you can have in Brazil as a motivating factor!"
"Positive","Pure quality.: You need to be too shallow to give this a bad review. If you have any bit of appreciation for great music in general you will find out that this is the needle in the haystack when it comes to finding rare great music. You don't need big fanfare and big productions behind projects. I said it before, when you have talent, all you need is a couple of great guitar players, and a great woman with a charismatic voice that was formed by paying her dues. Those many nights of endless singing making people cry anywhere from big theaters to the tiniest cafe places of the globe. Sometimes for a small salary, but most times just for joy. This is Chavela. This is the meat and potatoes of the Mexican Music. This is the juicy stuff. Chavela is no studio-made artist. Chavela formed herself burning the midnight oil and by scrambling our and her own feelings to create some of the best music in the last two centuries. Plain and simple."
"Positive","good quality....: this ball is good in quality material that is sold at a good price i defitnetly recommend this ball it will last you a long time cause i use it on concrete and still bounces good."
"Negative","Toasti Toes 40 pairs from Brand Variety: Ordered 8 boxes of Toasti Toes Toe Warmers (40 pair per box) that were sold by Brand Variety. When my order came it was in a very small box that contained a total of 8 pairs.....not the 320 pairs that I paid for. When I called them they said that the AD price was wrong and they can't fulfill my order of the 320 pairs I should have received. I did finally get a refund but will never purchase anything from this seller again. THEY DID NOT HONOR WHAT THEY ADVERTISED !!"
"Negative","Picture It - Point Break without any redeeming qualities: Now you have seen the Fast & Furious.This movie is so terrible, I can only say.....if you have to see it - WAIT for the video.Here's the story.... Undercover cop infiltrates a group of losers who spend astronomical amounts of money (with no identifiable income) on little bitty imports in the quest to develop the ultimate ""10 second"" car. The cop becomes attached to the losers and then has to choose between his new friends (& love of street racing) and his career.The film could have made up for the poor story, acting & dialog if they had filled it with stunt driving, but with only 2 interesting driving sequences the movie was a total waste of time."
"Negative","Prometheus: Slow developing of characters and the relationships to each other and the project. Predictable story line, actually boring in some spots. Glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater."
"Negative","Didn't get the Mildew off Sunbrella fabric cushion covers: Bought this to get the mildew/mold off some outdoor dining seat cushions and it didn't help. I tried spraying directly on the seat cushions and also mixing with bleach (as the directions indicate) and still - no use. Back to the drawing board for these cusion covers!"
"Negative","Trite poorly written nonsense that has nothing to say about Parrish's art.: I was so tempted to give one star and probably would have if the author didn't stop when she did.The book has nothing of importance to say, no insights and only the author's opinions with very little to back it up.If tempted to purchase a book about the art of Parrish, avoid this one as it will disappoint.Perhaps the photo of the author in a sleeveless black frock and elbow length gloves was warning enough of the calibre of this insipid book.It is so bad, I wouldn't lend it or give it away. No one deserves to be punished by it."
"Negative","Fail: The controller I bought was not the kind that I had expected. Instead it was a dark, generic looking one and it didn't have the Super Nintendo logo on it. I tested it out and the buttons was kinda stiff and hard so I threw it away. Best bet is to go to a game store that sells them and get the real thing. Complete waste of my money."
"Positive","great product: the product came on time and works exceptionally well. it fits the windshield exactly as advertised and does make a dramatic difference in how hot the inside of the car becomes when parked."
"Positive","comfortable, nice fit: I normally get Under Armour spandex (which can be about $25 a pair) but this was really nice! I love the cut, and the texture is nice as well. The actual color has more of a tint of bright coral, but I like it like that. I'll be getting more mizuno spandex in the future!"
"Negative","Disappointed, esp. after reading reviews here: This is a bit cheeky, but after reading this book, which I got as a gift, I was reminded of how my ex would always complain about his ""Playboy"" when it would come.""Such great pictures,"" he would say, ""now why the hell do they think they can improve them with a lot of pretentious writing.""I felt the same way about this book. Except that the pictures weren't as good as Playboy, either."
"Negative","Not that great: Sure it looks cool at first, but when I bought this a couple years ago, the game was too complicated and boring, trust me, don't by this unless you like this sort of thing."
"Negative","Does Not Deliver What It Promises: I would not recommend this book for people who are trying to get their life together after a diagnosis of diabetes. I bought this book because its subtitle is ""A Complete Guide to Planning, Shopping, Cooking, and Eating"". It is none of those things.I was particularly interested in the SHOPPING promise because I find that to be the most difficult part of managing my diet. Other books didn't have anything helpful, and despite its promise, this book doesn't either. One has to read through every single recipe, write down the ingredients of what you want to make, and then go out and get it. Just like every other book. So tell me: how does this help with ""shopping""? I expected lists of basic staples in a diabetic's diet. There should be lists of ""must-haves"" for your pantry. This book lies about what it contains, and is sadly lacking in what it needs.An expensive mistake, don't buy it."
"Positive","Great Horror All It's Own: To start off, the original Dawn Of The Dead could never be replaced or out done by a remake, but the remake is incredible just like the original. The best thing about it was that it wasn't a duplicate of the original, like the remake of Psycho where it was exactly the same. This film just takes the base story form the original, like the shopping mall, and then goes in it's own direction. Now the zombies run, which I still haven't made up my mind about which is better walking or running zombies. This movie had eveything a great horror movie needs, the suspense, some jump scenes, a little nudity, I especially loved the scene where an acoustic version of Down With The Sickness is played. All together this movie is really great with the effects, the gore, and an all around great story. Note be sure to watch to the end of the credits to learn the fate of the group."
"Positive","Inspiration and good basic instruction: I purchased this video on the OneTaste website. It has inspiring stories about OM from couples who do the practice and animated demonstrations. My partner and I have been practicing with it for a while now. It gives you all you need to get started. I also gifted it to several friends who love it. A nice wedding present!"
"Negative","A more annoying character I've NEVER met...: I have to say, that after reading all of the reviews of this book, I was really looking forward to this one. And I was highly disappointed. Tiffany Trott has to be one of the most annoying female characters I have ever read. Bridget Jones, she is not. I took this book with me on vacation and was expecting to finish it in a day or so. It took me 5 days to dredge through all the horrific dates in this book. I kept on through it all, hoping that the ending would redeem the rest of the novel. No such luck. (Upon finishing this book, I threw it against the wall of my hotel room in disgust)! Tiffany Trott as a book and a character has little, if any, redeeming qualities. My advice: stick to Bridget and leave this wannabe alone!"
"Positive","Fantasia 2000: I was extremely pleased with the cost, quick delivery, and excellent condition of this DVD. I highly recommend this vendor, and would use them again!"
"Positive","An epic novel: Chris Kubasik really did a wonderful job with this one. I own nearly every Battletech novel and gaming system and this novel has really stood out. The realism in the 'horrors of war' concepts truely stand out as well as the feelings of the main character Paul Masters as he see's that it is not an 'ideal war'. One last thing his Phoenix Hawk is the best described mech in any of the books i have read."
"Positive","Marsha's review on Mike: Off the Wall is unequivocally Michael Jackson's best work. Just the put the CD on and hit play and shake your butt until the last track. It's hard to believe that Off the Wall has never got the respect it deserved because of Thriller. I know that Off the Wall is a must have for any music lover.Here are some exceptional tracks off of this music classic:1) Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough -- Great disco groove.2) Rock With You -- so smooth.....3) Working Day and Night -- More disco groove.In summary, this is a must-have album."
"Positive","Pink Panther cd review: CD arrived very quickly with no damages as it came very well packaged, it had also a reasonable and competitive price, will buy again for sure, I am very satisfied with service."
"Negative","Don't bother ordering these: The listing picture is not representative of the product. It is made out of hard plastic, and it is thick. The result is that it extends into the wheel well by about an inch!Because of the photo, I was expecting something that fits tight against the back of the wheel well and wraps around the body a little bit. I was surprised to see that this mounts against the back of the well but extends so far into the wheel well."
"Negative","Never Again: I will never purchase this product again, within 2 hours my Chocolate Lab was having an allergic reaction and within 5 hours my Black Lab was having an allergic reaction. The worst 2 days of my life!"
"Positive","Bottom Line: This case provides the best protection in relation to weight available for your $400 - $450 investment."
"Negative","Lines in the video and `buzzing' after a few months: I wanted to use this to connect my Direct TV receiver to other TVs via coax. It worked fine for a while, but after a few months, I noticed this unit started producing lines in the video that would cause buzzing. I tried shortening the power cable as someone else commented on in another review which did not help I even tried using the S-video input with no difference. It's now too late to return the unit ( The cost of shipping back for warranty does not make returning it worthwhile.) I will try a different one from a local store so I can return it if it does not work."
"Negative","Bad Dudes... try Bad Game: ...Bad Dudes is a lack luster game. Once you beat it, it goes out of rotation and eventually gets traded in. I would not suggest this to anyone. I would prefer Double Dragon, River City Ransom or even the TMNT Arcade Game before this one. Don't waste your time or money."
"Negative","Accordian Tribe: A friend once joked to me that the music in heaven is played on a harp, while music in hell is played on an accordian. At the time, I was offended because I've enjoyed accordian music since my childhood. After hearing this CD, I must agree with my friend. I consider listening to it a second time much worse than a trip to hades. I can't give it away for fear of losing a friend, and it lacks the aerodynamic qualities of a Frisbee. Perhaps I could send it to the earlier reviewer as a replacement for his CD after he wears it out from repeated playing?"
"Positive","LOVE THIS DECK!: I love the energy of this deck. I am a ""crystal"" addict - meaning the rock and gem sort of crystals, and found this deck to be very complimentary to the other oracle cards I use. The information is so helpful and the illustrations are amazing.If you love crystals and love to use oracle cards, I highly recommend this deck.HAVE FUN WITH IT!!"
"Negative","Lid Breaks Off: My Brother's family has gone through TWO diaper genies and we have now gone through ONE. The lid breaks off of them after a while, around a years worth of use, not abuse. I am very dissapointed by this and we can't be the only family that this happens to. I am going to try to reach Playtex to see if they will send a new lid for ours. It depends upon their response whether or not I will buy another one for our next child. It is no use buying Stage 2 refills as they are more expensive and do not control odor any better than the stage one. By the time they are old enough for Stage 2 they usually only poop one to two times a day and I could use the fresh air I get from taking the diaper out to our big trash can outside after changing that kind of a diaper anyways."
"Negative","Better films out there: so soWarren Oates has done better in other films. He never seems to have beengiven really good roles."
"Negative","Allison Dubois is the real thing but....: I thought this book would be more about Allison and that it may tie in with ""Medium"" the television series. It was more about how to tell if your child has the gift and how to handle it - there were some real life stories - interesting that she does not get her information in dreams like the TV show. Other than that I feel I wasted the money on both her books. Not so great - although I love the show."
"Negative","Plastic connectors break: Lasted 5 minutes, both the connector that came with this and the one that came with the tip both broke. Plastic not make for anything over 1,000 PSI."
"Positive","the best real rap out there: there are a lot of ""fake"" rappers out there now but xzibit is real. this is one of the best cds i own along with fellow cali rapper tupac. if u love rap , u need to get this album now"
"Negative","just awful: ~ fortunately i found New Faces of '52 on a VHS that was performed on TV. LIVE. Minus Eartha Kitt (thank God). Love it."
"Positive","More wonderfulness, please.: This is must-have stuff for any Queen fan. Brian rocks his heart out, holds nothing back. His cover of Hendrix's ""One Rainy Wish"" is just phenomenal."
"Positive","Leather Motorcycle Jacket: The jacket was more than I expected. It is a great jacket than I recieved for the price. The jacket is a good quality.Rebel Ryder Men's Stone Leather Motorcycle Jacket And the service was great. I received the jacket way before the due date given."
"Negative","It is the most degrading book by a black woman author: My daughter brought this book home to read. I was appauled.This book written by a black woman is degrading Afro-American people as well as black women. I feel Afro-American people haven't reach the diversity to talk about our hair. The language(Black English) is not how Black people talk today. I feel Herron need to be sued by the Black community .She has allot of guts writing some insulting literature for other cultural to relate to in the class room. She is slapping her race in the face, as well as calling us ""Buck Wheat"" off the Little Rascals.I feel as a Afro-American Historian and educator. I couldn't get away with teaching or reading this literature to a class of white children or any other ethnic child. I would be fired not resigned to another school."
"Negative","Avery Greeting Cards: I'm disappointed in these Avery greeting cards. They are not scored where they need to be folded. I guess I'll go back to Hallmark greeting cards. They ARE scored where the fold should be and that makes it much easier to fold them. Also, the paper is rather flimsy for a greeting card. I expected more from Avery. I was going to return them but decided I would go ahead and try them when I run out of the Hallmark ones. If you want cards that have a fold score and heavier paper, these are not the ones to get. I will not be buying these again."
"Negative","Super short inseam, defective pair?: I'm usually a XS in american apparel, so I was surprised--when I removed them from the packaging, I could instantly tell they were going to be short. I'm 5'6 and the inseam on these must have been around 28in. I tried to not roll the waistband, but then it just looked silly wearing it lower like that, it didn't fit. Will have to return, super disappointed. $20 wouldve been a steal for these."
"Negative","12 Volt Hair Dryer: This dryer puts out a small amount of heat, making it not worth the time and trouble to dry my long hair. I think I should have purchased an inverter that allows a more powerful watt dryer instead. If you have short, thin hair I suppose it would be o.k."
"Positive","Fab Music, Mystery & ""Story-telling"": Anyone who likes 'violin' should see thisI loved the seperate stories connecting with theviolin - all though, some very poignant - in the courseof it's life. It is very interesting how the story-telling waspresented. It took a while, for me, to catch-on what was happeningExcept, for the ending it is not exactly a cheerful moviebut worth the time to watch, and in my case, to add to mymovie collection which I did - I loved the ending!"
"Positive","Right on! ;): The movie was in great condition and arrived promptly. I couldn't be happier. Would buy from seller again!"
"Negative","Does not have enough power for iPad: This is a decent hub that worked flawlessly so far, however it has one shortcoming, which is that it does not have enough power to charge an iPad..."
"Positive","""dreams"" debut cd.: song list: intro, bring it all back, over your shoulder, chubby, baby dont go, carnival, note, boredom,interim, blondie, chameleon, ill be fine, what do you wanna do, crimes, so like a clown, afraid of what i know, disappear. great debut cd!"
"Negative","Ban these Quick Cut conc ert DVDs: Buy the last Megadeth DVD instead (Rude Awakening) if you want to enjoy watching Megadeth from the couch. I can't wait until this trend of quick cuts for camera shots slows down in metal DVDs. You NEVER get to see a guitar solo anymore."
"Positive","**SHAKE IT, BELLYDANCERS!**: The entire CD is an inspiration to me as a bellydancer. I can't help but want to dance when I hear the music and it gets the creative juices flowing for making up choreography! All tracks are fun, funky percussion - perfect for hip shaking and shimmying. A must for any serious bellydancer's music collection!!!"
"Positive","Love the music: She sings beautifully and for my first Sarah I love it Peaceful, calm and beautiful words and music"
"Positive","Poetry of Illumination and the 'Examined Life': Not all poets nor readers of poetry for that matter are interested in the 'examined life' but Linda Gregg is and has been since the publication of her first book of poetry. In her latest book 'Things and Flesh', she continues this examination. Her topics are life, death, love, betrayal, good and evil- all that matters. Hers is the voice of the lyrical poet who uses images from her daily life experiences to question the relationship between knowing and imagining-between experience and hope. Gregg is a great utilizer of Western myths to explore our being 'self conscious' and her myth poems have a coherency and immediacy which are illuminating. In this book she uses both Greek and Southeast Asia locations and mythologies to examine the predicaments of our lives. In our world filled with noise and over-stimulation it is a relief to reach for this book and listen to Gregg's voice of intelligent contemplation."
"Positive","Fondue Party: I purchased this to help celebrate Valentine's Day with my Granddaughters. We had chocolate fondue with strawberries, angel food cake, graham crackers. It was a lot of fun and very easy to clean up. Loved it and I think my granddaughters enjoyed it also."
"Negative","Fun but lame: The issue of bugs has been beaten to death. I have a good system and I found that I couldn't go for the best graphics, but I didn't have to settle for the worst. It is buggy, but I lack the technical sophistication to argue whether it is my fault or the game's fault.I was indignant and horrified that the gooks have choppers and armored vehicles. The game creators made bold pretenses with their dubious history lessons before each singleplayer level, then they insult the player's intelligence. The point should be that the VC can beat the US with numbers, skill and ingenuity. The game makers made BF Vietnam into a farce. This is BF 1942 to a '60's soundtrack with assault rifles instead of Garands and MP 40's.By the way, this is nothing like real combat. It is a fun shoot-em-up type game and nothing more."
"Positive","Timothy is Beyond Life and Ahead of his time: This is a near perfect CD. The musical selections seem to put the soul at ease as Timothy Leary would want it. The Moody Blues contribute several tracks to this CD such as Legend of a Mind. Allen Ginsburg also appears on Track 10. This CD is a must have for anyone who respects Timothy Leary. This CD includes Trip- Hop, and Indian influences and is a must buy."
"Positive","DA BEZT: TO ALL THE PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE WHO THINK MIKE TYSON IS A THUG,, RAPIST, EAR BITER AND SO ON HE HAS ALOT OF MANA WHICH MEANS RESPECT IN MAORI AND HIS MOKU ON HIS FACE MEANS PRIDE AND THATS WHAT I HAVE FOR HIM AND ALOT OF PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE FOR HIM IS WELL AND THATS AS A PERSON, BUT AS A FIGHTER HE IS THE BEST HANDS DOWN AND THIS DVD SET SHOWS WHY HE IS SPECIAL. P.S THERE IS ALOT OF RUMOURS IN NEW ZEALAND THAT A VERY RICH PERSON WANTS TO OFFER MIKE TYSON A HUGE SUM OF MONEY TO FIGHT IN NEW ZEALAND AND FIGHT DAVID TUA IN AUCKLAND WHICH WOULD BE EXCELLENT, TYSON IN TUA,T.N.T I THINK TYSON WOULD KNOCK HIM OUT."
"Negative","what the?: this album is nominated by me for the worst thing that ever happened this year for music. The lyrics seemed to be written by a four year old who is retarded. I've lost faith in Method man after this album"
"Positive","I'm Very Satisfied With This CD! (A+): I went to see a play and before the play started they piped in music for the people in the audience to listen to while waiting for the actors to come out and begin the play, one of the songs that was played was Rosemary Clooney's Come on-a My House and I really loved it and thought it was a wonderful catchy song and I thought wow, Rosemary Clooney is a wonderful singer so when I decided to buy a Rosemary Clooney CD this is the one I chose and I love all of the songs, Come On-a My House, Mambo Italiano, etc, and I'm truly pleased with this CD and I highly recommend it!"
"Positive","Great Movie: I bought this movie as a Christmas gift to a teenager that loves the older classics. She was happy to have this movie.As always, Thanks.. Thelma"
"Positive","Eurkea: One of my favorite shows of all time. It was quirky, fun, and just plain enjoyable. It was the little things like Tesla High, the water fountain in the middle of the town, etc. that made me really pay attention.A really enjoyable show - I am really going to miss this series."
"Negative","Not worth the money!: I am not impressed with this book at all. In fact, I am a bit disappointed. Not much ""new"" or inspiring information and ideas for us. My daughter has had celiac for 3 years so maybe it is just too basic for us/her. The book is cute, and could be interesting to a NEW celiac child but was not a worthwhile purchase for us three years down the gluten-free road. I also think the price is a bit steep for the type of book. Very plain, black and white sketches, not even drawn by the child! 5 or 6 dollars would be more appropriate for what you get. I guess after all the reading and research I have done to educate myself, my daughter and our family about celiac, I was looking for a kids version of some of that content and information. This just wasn't it for us. Looking for something a bit more educational and informative. Sorry! Cute idea and a great project for a school report.... May just have my daughter write up her own story and celiac knowledge for a school report/ project!"
"Positive","Faster! A Racers Diary - Jackie Stewart / Peter Manso: Jackie Stewart was one of the finest racers I ever had the privilege of watching. Out of 99 Grands Prix he won a staggering 27! In 1969 after only four years in F1 he won his first world championship. This book details the following year 1970, a difficult year for Stewart since he lost two very close friends to motor racing.This book recounts how Stewart was forced to re-examine and affirm his motivation and commitment to the sport, before charging back in 1971 to win his second of three world championships."
"Positive","brilliant book: This book touched upon many different aspects of carp fishing. It was not only very informative, but was expressed in exquisite prose. What I didn't understand was the books emphasis on the hypothesis that carp are "" generally evil creatures "". I thought these sentiments were not only full of hate, but completely contradictory to the huge mass of research which suggests the complete opposite. What also stuck out to me was the book's "" carp as slaves "" suggestion. Otherwise, the book was great."
"Positive","Best Eyemask EVER !: Purchased this item because I am mid day sleeper and cannot sleep unless I have an eyemask on.This one is great because of the curved walls of the mask. I wear contacts and normally cannot sleep with them on mid day because I cannot blink my eyes under normal masks. This also allows me to sleep and have my REM time as well which normally does not occur with normal masks because it interferes with the blinking of your eyelids.I will be purchasing another one for my husband as we both sleep during the day and the quality as well as the price of this particular item is just great.I should also note that I have a large head and most masks the straps are so thin that over time they tend to be stretched out and break, this one has a nice thick strap with a velcro closure which was a nice change of pace."
"Positive","Amazing Singer...And Amaze album ""One Wish"": I love Whitney Houston christmas album and I'm sure anyone who is a big music lover will love it to. Whitney Houston sings her heart out on each song. Also, to make her first ever Christmas album special she add her little daughter on there...Its so sweet I mean you guys really need to check it out seriously. Whitney Houston rules on her first ever christmas album ""One Wish"" all the songs stands out and get you into the spirit of christmas...Or even the hollyghost spirit...Now thats a singer with a bless give if she can sing and touch your soul and your heart...Make you feel so good, happy etc..I recommend this song to everyone...Whitney Houston's One Wish is the way to go!"
"Positive","How Many Tarot Techniques Can You Find?: Valerie Sim, who is the list mother of one of the largest tarot e-lists on the Internet, has written her first book, in large part about Comparative Tarot, a technique she named. To read Sim's book is the equivalent of attending a graduate seminar with the Dean of the College of Comparative Education. However, ""Dean Sim"" not only explains the comparative technique, she gives many different examples of the various ways you can use more than one card to expand on, or give more depth to, your tarot readings. She also includes many readings with different spreads and with different decks. The book explores and explains exactly what Sim says in her title, i.e., ideas and exercises to challenge your imagination and to help you continue looking outside the box for different tarot experiences. It offers many techniques to learn and master. If you are unable to get anything new out of this book, draw the Judgement card immediately to help you get out of your own box."
"Positive","Sweet!: This is exactly what I needed. It can be use in two different ways. You can have two different computers hooked up to it or just have a computer monitor and a tv output and only using one computer."
"Positive","CAN YOU FEEL THE LOVE BUZZ? YEEAAHH: Greetings to all simple rock oriented rock listeners..Having been around during the Seattle GRUNGE era..I must HAIL this album by LOVE Battery,""Confusion Au GOGO"",,it kicks from alpha to omega..I remeber seeing them live..nice tunes.just like NIRVANA,,yeah ITs simply sweet mixed with great grunge hits..Colorblind is the Best,The bassist is so roar,,yeeahh..and Monkey Brain is sugar to my Ears...I wish Kurt Cobain did a song with him,,They would've made the world complete..R>I>P>"
"Positive","Best Mixer on the Market: There is no other mixer I would buy after having used this KitchenAide because there is no comparison. It has made my life easier since I have a permanent injury to my arm and cannot mix anything by hand. I have recomended this mixer to everyone and they are just as happy with their purchase. I really enjoy baking and not just around the Holidays."
"Negative","Lacks conceptual continuity: Admittedly I don't like ""greatest hits"" albums; this one is especially odious. Strictly Commercial, produced after Zappa's death, collects nineteen songs from sixteen albums (Hot Rats, Apostrophe, Over-nite Sensation, We're Only In It For the Money, Sheik Yerbouti, One Size Fits All, Joe's Garage, Them or Us, Weasels Ripped My Flesh, Freak Out!, Zoot Allures, Guitar, Tinsel Town Rebellion, Chunga's Revenge, Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch, and Bongo Fury) and three singles. Each single is inferior to its album version. As far as I am familiar with the source albums (owning and liking twelve of the sixteen), each original album is more enjoyable than this item. I cannot recommend Strictly Commercial over any of Zappa's original works."
"Negative","No more Farberware for me: My parents used to buy a Farberware percolator every 10 years. I had to buy TWO in 2011--this one and a smaller one. I thought the first one was a quality control glitch, but to have two in a row go bad in less than 6 months is a clear sign that the company has faltered. Goodbye, Farberware.I finally bought a Presto percolator, and so far it is fantastic. Four months and still perks for 5 minutes--good strong coffee. The Farberware pots would perk for less and less time until they quit altogether. I don't have time to package up products and return them. I like quality products that last."
"Positive","Money Well Spent: First, the sharpener was at my door well before the estimated delivery date. I have a sharpening stone that I have been useing for 30 years and I could not find a quality replacement for it, so I figured I would try to get to the modern era. Am I ever so happy I did. This piece of equipment makes short work of knife sharpening and the edge is perfect every time. If you use straight edge cutlery in your home you need this machine, but you have to have electricity for it to work."
"Positive","Quintessential Tori: Never do I get tired of listening to this album. It's the first one I heard and has remained, after 6 years, my favorite. Poetry to music. There are so many MOMENTS in these songs. So many moods. The ones that shine: Pretty Good Year, Bells for Her, Cloud on My Tongue, Baker Baker, Space Dog, and Yes, Anastasia. My favorite."
"Positive","Completely worth the Read!: I bought this for myself, I'll be 40 this year. I looked all over my house for it and found my 56 year old mother had not only borrowed it, but was becoming a RUNNER!!! She brought it to the Dr for his thoughts & apparently he ordered it for his wife!! I bought this & several running books from amazon taking advantage if the low prices & free shipping!! ,"
"Positive","leaf blower by toro: not to loud ..blows really nice...weighs a tad..strap would have been nice...very happy with it ..much better than a rake. always had good luck with toro products. a really good buy. consumers report rated it highly."
"Positive","Career Bachelor: I choose to not marry. I myself, like anyone, can CHOOSE to do virtually anything, not just postulate to victim mode that made me not want relationships or make excuses to support the lie why gay is normal or circumstance caused. Lets not play games here. Man + woman is natural. Honored only in marriage. Nothing else works! I've tried the wrong way many times. Happy single and not willing to change. Oh, by the way, as a single person, I can truely say, abstenence is the only thing that works for unmarrieds. Nothing else works! I've tried the wrong way many times. I know in my heart of hearts that this book speaks it straight reguardless of the people who hate the union of couples and slander it by any means. Like the cesspool TV shows and all the supporters of the likes. The author of marriage will heal your wounds of devientcy if you let him."
"Positive","Boz is so Amazing!: I got the Boz Dvd from my close friend for my 2yr old son to watch. I sat with him to watch the Adventures of Boz that very same day. I was so taken by the way the dvd captured his attention, by the way it was demonstrated through everyday life situations.The songs contributed tremendously towards getting his attention which allowed him to finally sit through an entire movie (dvd), which is very unusal for him. He wanted to watch it over and over and over again since then. The prayer at the end of each segment is truely inspiring for any family to encourage their children to be thankful to GOD's blessings.My son knows this dvd like his prayer book. The songs are programmed in his head like a broken record and has learned everything from shapes to sharing etc just by watching the Boz.The producers of Boz should be proud. This was well executed. Your money will be well spent. I AM TRUELY A BOZ FAN."
"Positive","Great condition, fast delivery: Delivery: Said that it would be delivered in 4 to 6 weeks but came within two weeks.Textbook quality: the textbook was not used. Except for some wear on the cover, the pages were crisp and didn't contain writing or highlighting."
"Negative","Not so Perfect Pancake: This was a total waste of money. A plain old skillet works much better. The ""non-stick"" surface is not non stick. The pancakes either stuck to the top or spilled out when I tried to flip them. I tried to give it to my son, but he didn't want it. I was amazed at how bad this product really was."
"Negative","A Bore: I felt this book to be boring, an inferior rehash of Roth's other work. In fact, the prose is sentimental and often downright poor."
"Positive","Jewish Misrepresentation of Passover Family Pack: The Passover Seder is firmly founded in Israelite history, pointing to the Greater Passover Lamb, Yeshua Ha Maschiach (Yeshua the Messiah), who in over 300 places in the TaNaKh (Old Testament) is proven to be Judaism's (as well as everyone's) Messiah. Mainstream Judaism refuses to acknowledge this, due to their own agenda in maintaining documents outside of the Torah as the final authority. What Yeshua came against was the misrepresentation of the scriptures, since Moses wrote about him. Thus, the Passover Family Pack is not foundationally misrepresented and should be kept in the Judaism section of Amazon.com"
"Negative","Batteris last 2 months!!: I was very happy with these batteries for the first week! Seemed to good to be true!! It was! Within a few weeks the batteries quickly started losing their charge, and after 2 months barely last for 24 hours before needing a recharge. I can't believe these batteries were new when I bought them, and suspect they were refurbished....."
"Positive","Tells the Truth About the Ukrainian Genocide of the Poles: During World War 2, Ukrainian-fascist-nationalists (the UPA, the so-called Ukrainian Insurgent Army), imitating the German Nazis, murdered over 100,000 Polish civilians in the most brutal manner imaginable. After collaborating with the Germans in the genocide against the Jews in 1942, the Ukrainian nationalists abandoned German service and formed genocidal bands directed at defenseless Polish civilians. Children were impaled on stakes, and adults were quartered, etc. This was no ""liberation of the Ukraine"", as Ukrainians had voluntarily co-existed with Poles for centuries on territories which had possessed a mixture of Poles and Ukrainians for centuries, if not from antiquity."
"Positive","The London Sound: This is a wonderful compilation of songs from some of the leading acts in the UK, including Oasis, The Charlitans, Depeche Mode, Stone Roses and a host of others. The album takes a couple of twists and turns in styles with the hip-hop sounds of Stereo MCs, to the dreamy vocals provided by Lush, and to the happy-go-lucky tune from Cornershop. It was a shame that the enigma of the UK, Morrissey, was not included in this compliation since he certainly adds a dimension to the great music coming over from the pond. One album cannot cover the gammet of Indie from the other side of the Atlantic, but this is certainly a very good start. So if you have any Smiths, New Order, The The, Housemartins or Suede (who is on 'Shine' as well), then I recommend adding this album to your collection. The double CD will certainly whet your appetite, 'ole chap!"
"Positive","One Tree Hill's Road Mix: I only bought this CD because I've been watching One Tree Hill from the very first season (and b/c of that hot James Lafferty, bka Nathan Scott). This CD is so good. I've listened to this CD in my car CD player for about the last 6 months!"
"Positive","This really is the real Howard Roberts: Roberts made many recording but many where pop records, full of corny pop songs. This is a true jazz record, with a great band, solos, and jazz feel. If you are a jazz guitar fan/collector, you need to add this to your collection. No BS stuff here, this is the real mccoy!"
"Negative","doesn't fit sony ps3 40 gb: ok so this thing does not fit at all on a 40 gig ps3 and they are aware of this and there still selling these.they should atleast print something on the box about it not fitting on a 40 gb system but they dont.but i still have it on my ps3 but thats because its not on straight and the little clips broke off even though it wasn't fault because in the directions it says to push until you hear a click or something like that.well anyway this does work pretty well as far as removing hot air from the system,thats why i gave it a 2 star.but it doesn't fit right on my 40gig system! :( wonder if they'll send me a redesigned replacement even though the little clips broke off?"
"Positive","Great for learning or a little reminder: This book offers great little tidbits of information about common sales mistakes. It has truly improved my closing ratio. This is a great book to pull out every once in awhile when you need a boost. Sometimes it is hard to break a habit and easy to slip into an old routine."
"Positive","ENTERTAINING HOKUM: I don't think it was inspired by the rumours that Apollo Never Happened. I think it was more the other way round; the Apollo-as-hoax myth got off the ground after the film was released.And a special message (on the day after Neil Armstrong left us, RIP Neil) for all you nutjobs out there who believe the rumours and the film: You are dead right. And Elvis is on tour with Princess Di. And Lord Lucan shot JFK from the grassy knoll while mounted on Shergar!"
"Negative","Cheap: The good news is that it is very simple and very inexpensive. The bad news is that it sounds terrible. It sounds muffled and there is a hum."
"Positive","Perfect, what else is there to say?: No Kidding, best flashlight in the world. If you want quality and something that's going to last, maglite is the one regardless of the color! No, I don't work for them and don't own stock in the company!"
"Positive","The Drama of ""Stonehenge"": I teach High School boys and this video kept their attention. Not easy to do! The dramatic re-enactment of the theory on how Stonehenge was built was very well done. I highly recommend this video."
"Negative","gets rusty: When I got this, I seasoned it as the instructions said. Putting a little oil in a frying pan on low, and put press in it. I've used it exactly twice since. Now I've noticed that it is all rusty. It it also very wide and does not fit into most fry pans, only very large ones. Don't bother to buy it."
"Negative","It worked more than year.: This one was my last Panasonic item. It did work but just one year+. I stopped buying any Panasonic electronics. I don't know if Panasonic quality is much better in any other price range."
"Positive","Great pan-- don't know how I did without it for so long: Amazing pan. Super easy to clean, great grill marks, makes cooking healthy a breeze (grilled veggies come out perfectly). I was between a round and square pan, and part of me thinks a square might be better because it would fit more food. However arguments for more even heating in a round pan are compelling. Jury's still out."
"Negative","Where's the "".Net"": I found the title of this book to be very misleading. First and foremost, this book has nothing to do with the "".Net"" platform. At best this book reviews some Microsoft technologies that can be used when creating an e-commerce site (namely, Commerce Server), but misses the whole point of the "".Net"" platform (i.e. web services and the like). Additionally, I found the author to be very self-aggrandizing - ""I found that..."" or ""When I do do this I ..."" or ""I will define ..."". This becomes overbearing by chapter 2 - the entire first 300+ pages are about the esoteric nuance of web design - in his opinion. This book is weak in examples and techniques - it is not a "".Net Bible"" by any stretch of the immagination."
"Negative","A Usable [Item]: At least you can drink the coffee that comes out of the thing, unlike the Mr. Coffee, which produces coffee loaded with stinking plasticizer from the cheap plastic. However, this isn't a 12-cup machine at all; it's about a 6-cup machine, using the 6:1 volume ratio of water to ground coffee recommended by Starbuck's and Joy of Cooking. Cuisinart tells you to use half that, as if you were using cheap trash coffee, and it tastes terrible. Also, plan on spending a LOT of time cleaning the grinding chamber. I'm a pretty disgruntled customer. For my main application, I'm going to be reduced to running two batches, ground outside the machine. By the way, when it fires up the grinder on the timer, it's reminiscent of an air raid siren. It's a blade grinder, not a burr grinder. [Later] OK, I use it for all my coffee making. I grind outside the machine so I won't have to clean the grinding chamber. I'm happy enough. You never know when I'll want the timer-grinder feature."
"Negative","metamorphoses ?: i have been waiting for a cd with vocals from jmj from a long time, but i had no idea that it was going to be this weak !jmj was one of the pioneers of electronic music, that i have to admit. since his success and the million dollar concerts, all the extravaganza's i would have hoped that this cd would have had the artists that shaped his career such as christophe, patrick juvet, etc....instead he picked the weather girls ? (or whatever they're called) natacha atlas, laurie anderson.............why ?to be on the top 10 ?if jmj wanted to go back to his roots, i would have thought he would have done a better job at it , what a pity !"
"Negative","Won't charge an odd number of batteries: This charger only works with 2 or 4 batteries, and won't work with an odd number. Considering that the primary motivation of me getting it was so I could charge the batteries in my bike light, which takes 3, this is a substantial disappointment.The package doesn't say anything about this restriction. Save your money and go with a more honest company."
"Negative","What?: This book was awful. Mr. Holt talks about these children as if they were some of the numbers on one of his off-the-wall math tests. He was rude and very uncaring. He used words like:""Stupid"", ""Ignorant"", ""Foolish."" These are words that I would never use to describe anyone; adult or child! I was very angered, especially about his description of a ""retarded child."" He stated,""What first struck me about this child, as so often is the case with seriously retarded children, was the extraordinary ugliness of her face."" What? Since when can anyone control the way they look; and to think that this child was handicapped. Now I am all for someone having and forming their own opinion, but in no way would I take my uneducated views and published them in a book, then place a title on it that had the words,""Children"" and ""Fail"" in it. I do not recommend this book."
"Negative","never was able to get this for my kids: wont download what a shame and custermer service give you the run around what a jip to waist money made my kids cry"
"Positive","i love this prequel trilogy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: i really did enjoy this movie alot i like just as much as the orginials this movie rocks i love how the prequel trilogy shows the tragic side of how anakin skywalker became darth vader this movie rocks may the force be with you live long and prosper and have a nice day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Positive","Quick! Easy!! and Delicious!!!: I am an Indian and a big fan of cookbooks - both as a coffee-table collection and for actual cooking. This book has some interesting recipes, some better than the others. The few that we have tried out so far were really good and I can think of quite a few more that look tempting from the description. Most of them seem to be ""quick and easy"" as the author suggests; even though some of them may call for a relatively high number of ingredients. Having said that, most Indian entrees do require a lot of ingredients. My only complaint is the lack of attractive pictures. There are a few, but not nearly enough. I am a visual person and a few more colored pictures would make this a great coffee-table addition!"
"Positive","I LIKE ZOLLIE!: ""ZOLLIE GOES WEST"" was a lot of fun to read and I learned how to be a good friend. Zollie helped me understand why we are all just a little bit different. The world would be very boring if we all were exactly the same.Ryan"
"Positive","Life in a French Prison: In spite of the violence it inevitably portrays, this film manages to develop characters that are neither stereotypical nor so strange to viewers that they cannot identify with them. Tahar Rahim perfectly plays the progression of a nineteen-year-old boy from wide-eyed neophyte to cold-blooded killer. An instant classic."
"Negative","The Chronicles of Narnia: VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!These are 20 min story flicks that is nothing like the movie. Wish I would have never bought it...What a waste of money.The movies are great but that is not what this is....."
"Positive","Levi's Mens 514 Blue Collar Jean: these fit perfectly, but were much lighter weight than I had anticipated. However, overall that makes them great for all-year round!"
"Positive","What a great product!: We were recording old LP's for mom onto DVD's when the stereo with the ""phono in"" jack died. This arrived, plugged between the rca cables to the computer, and the rca audio cables for the turntable, and we had volume again. Thanks for a great product!!"
"Negative","It workeed fine until it didn't: This worked fine for about 3 months and than the left channel stopped working. Of course now I have to deal with Sennheiser to get it repaired, wish me luck"
"Negative","very disappointed: bought this knife cuisinart was a durable high quality knife , was i ever wrong used it 6 or 8 times and knife quit fileting to top it off i;ve tried twice to contact them with not so much of a hello from them geeeeeeeez THANKS for very expensive lesson"
"Negative","Buckley's characters lack motivation or dimension: Joseph McCarthy was fascinatingly complex, whether one agrees with his politics or not. A novel should be the perfect medium to explore what made him tick, and a wordsmith like William F. Buckley should be just the writer. Unfortunately, Buckley is content to recite a litany of activities coupled with a handful of traits to produce at best a two-dimensional portrait of McCarthy. Given the quality of Buckley's espionage fiction, this book is a literary disappoinment."
"Negative","Get a Clue, Hollywood. We're Smarter Than That.: With Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Hollywood proves once again that they think moviegoers are all morons. This boring, ridiculous movie offers nothing other than two attractive people to look at. In an age where smart, stylish spy films like Mission: Impossible and the Bourne Identity have added flair to a tired old genre, Mr. and Mrs. Smith takes viewers back to the 1980s when the most ridiculous of the James Bond movies were fashionable. This film is so poorly written and badly directed that I couldn't find anything positive about it. Despite bullets flying and cars exploding, I found myself falling asleep over and over again. This is nothing but a rehash of everything you saw in the old cheesy action films of 20 years ago with nothing fresh or interesting added at all."
"Negative","This book made me feel horrible!: I have to say that this book really disturbed me. I had to stop reading it because there was alot of ""VERY BAD THINGS"" involved in most of the stories that I read. I do realize this is a mystery book, but like I said, it made me feel horrible. I really wouldn't reccomend it to anyone who has a ""sensitive"" side."
"Positive","Junction 18 comes out of nowhere to make great, catchy cd: After I got Junction 18's Vicious Cycle, I listened to it a few times and liked a few songs, but I could never get into it. All of the songs seemed to go together and only a couple really stood out. The vocals were also too quiet and you can't really hear what is being said. All flaws from that cd are corrected with the CD Heroes from the Future. This is one of the best cd's I've heard in a long time. All 6 songs are absolutely awesome, sing-along-catchy. These guys also produce eccentric thought-provoking lyrics. These guys would probably be considered pop-punk, but aren't trying to appeal to mass audiences with their image and stupid teen-angst lyrics. These guys matured an incredible amount from their last cd. I would recommend this cd to anyone. BUY IT."
"Positive","A must have for R5 Administrators: This is the first R5 Administration Book I purchased and it is by far the best one out there. The author does a great job explaining R5 for the experienced R4 admin and even for people new to R5. It was also very helpful to me in studying for (and passing) all 3 admin exams. The information it contains is invaluable - Get yours today!"
"Positive","Legendary figures made real, legendary times brought to life: Readers looking for heroic adventures and mighty warriors set against the turmoil of the Migration Age will not be disappointed. But it is the struggle of Hagan, a young man coming to age in a time of great upheavals in politics, religion and culture that makes this story so compelling. We see beyond the dark and brooding Hagan of Grundy's earlier Rhinegold, into the heart of the man who must learn to balance honor and loyalty to his people with his own spiritual journey. Grundy lets us share the journey as Hagan grows into his dual birthright of princely duty and shamanistic power. If you liked Rhinegold, you will love Attila's treasure."
"Positive","It is big...: But size doesn't matter. He's much too big to be used as an action figure. Definitley a display model. Do electronics add that much to a toy? He's hard to transform, even more so than the small version. His tail is pretty cool though! Buy this toy if you're into Cheetor as a character, it does look awesome. The teeth in his mouth are a nice detail! If you're looking for something to play with, get the little one."
"Negative","Star Trek The Origial Series Remastered Season 2: I bought this remastered season of star trek and I think it's really good excellent work, however I did see a few mistakes paramount made on the episode ""Assignment Earth"" the control room scene is fuzzy with static were they forgot to digitally clean it up and there was some view screen scenes where you can see black specks and a scene where the elevator is going up the rocket and you can see mud on the camera."
"Negative","Actually ZERO stars would be better!: I was amazed how stupid this movie was. The 1951 version is a completely different movie and superior in every way. Don't waste money on this 2008 version. The only thing that is the same is there is an alien, a woman, and her son and a robot. The story line is too different and is an excuse for special effects. I usually like Keanu Reeves, but here he is a dork. I wish they would have made a movie that was more faithful to the original. We watched this on pay per view, so it was pretty cheap and we didn't feel ripped off by going to the movies or buying a dvd..."
"Positive","Highly recommend: If you are looking to get into brush calligraphy, then this is the book for you. It is clearly written and packed with all the information you'll ever need."
"Negative","Save your money!: I bought this book on the basis of a review. This is one of the sappiest pieces of tripe I've ever read - it's just as bad as Message in a Bottle. The dialogue is badly written, the characters are cliches and the story, supposedly so heart-wrenching, is unbelievably banal. Reading this book was an utter waste of time, and I'll never pick up another book by this author."
"Positive","Always wanted one: Great and handy but am not sure if the compass works properly, but happy with price and product overall. Great for travelling."
"Negative","Don't waste your $$$: HOUR OF REDEMPTION by Forrest Bryant Johnson is a thousand times the book that Breuer's is. Don't waste your $$$ on this one. Johnson wrote the original and it is the gold standard for the Cabanatuan raid (even far better than Sides' GHOST SOLDIERS).If you are interested in this subject, buy Johnson's book instead. It has been re-released and is available at the major bookstores as well as at Amazon.com. Johnson's HOUR OF REDEMPTION is the best WW II book I have read, bar none. I would highly recommend it to anyone, not just military buffs."
"Negative","You can read all these clues for free online.: Don't waste your money on this poorly written book. Doing a quick search online for ""Paul Is Dead clues"" will unearth everything that's in this book and then some. R. Gary Patterson goes way beyond the beyond to provide ""newer"" clues that don't even make sense in the context of the originals. Be prepared to read this book once and then let it collect dust, or give it away to someone who needs to kill an hour. There are much better resources to give you a Paul Is Dead fix than this book."
"Negative","Not very professionally done: With the movie's title you would expect this film to be a Christian testimonial, and it is... but it doesn't come across very well. I watched this with a friend who is also a Christian, and we were both disappointed. In fact we didn't watch the movie all the way through. The story line was spotty and jumpy and the testimonies were not really clear what the different people experienced: exactly where they were, how they got out and when. Facts first... feelings later... please. I wanted to like it and even be able to use it as means of starting a conversation about the gospel but I'm afraid it won't function in that way."
"Negative","A medieval book for a beginner: This book should only be read by those who dont't know the basics in game programming, like MCGA and mouse. The only thing I learned from this book was how to draw a 8x8 font from memory to screen. This book could be better if it would show the basics in VESA programming and Linear Frame Buffer, not in SVGA programming."
"Negative","Not worth it. It won't last.: Bought this ball 3 months ago and it started to deteriorate after the 1st week. Finally, last night the stitching became undone. I was only using it once a week on a hardwood basketball court. Amazon will not take it back, lets see if Mikasa USA will."
"Negative","don't buy this: For what ever reason this battery won't accept a charge. Old batt accepts charge but won't hold it this new one even after two full restores on ipod won't accept charge"
"Negative","Didn't hold its charge: I'm not sure why as I've purchased the Sony batteries before but this specific time it is not holding it's charge. I'll put it on the camera and after about 2 minutes it shows 65% less battery life. Not so happy with this shipment!"
"Negative","DON'T PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT: ITS NOISY!!!!. OVEN MUST BE SECURED BEFORE YOU OPEN THE TRAY DOOR, IF NOT SECURED THE OVEN ENDS UP IN YOUR LAP. DOES NOT COOK IN ALLOTTED TIMES SPECIFIED IN COOKING DIRECTIONS. IF WORKING WITH BREAD CRUMB ITEMS, WHEN YOU OPEN TRAY DOOR YOUR COUNTER GETS MESSY WITH CRUMBS. WHEN COOKING STEAKS, BURGERS, ANYTHING THAT HAS A LOT OF FAT DRIPPINGS, SPLATTERS WILL OCCUR AND THE OVEN IS A PAIN TO CLEAN. AGAIN, WHEN YOU OPEN TRAY DOOR DRIPPINGS WILL GET ALL OVER COUNTER. IF YOU WANT THIS OVEN FOR PIZZA YOU WLL FIND THAT IT DOES NOT CRISP IN SETTING TIME. THE INFOCOMMERCIAL IS A LOT OF BULL. I HAD TO GIVE THIS PRODUCT A 1 STAR TO GET THIS REVIEW POSTED."
"Negative","Piece of junk: After about 3 months it falls off the faucet and is no longer useable. A big waste of money. We had problems with another PUR model leaking so we thought this one might be better. Not at all."
"Negative","well-intentioned but confusing: Despite the title of his book, Zomchick has not done any research on 18th century law in the sense of reading statutes or legal decisions; rather, he defines ""law"" broadly in terms of social regulation; but that concept is empty if it remains ungrounded in any contemporaneous legal texts. Thus while I appreciate the intention to historicize the novels he discusses, I found it bizarre that he professed to locate them in their legal context without even discussing what most people think of when they think of law."
"Negative","Love Hobb and book but TTS...: With three learning disabilities I depend on my text to speech function on my kindle ... Disabling it is a unique form of punishment given how much I like Hobb's works...Thanks Random House :/FYI voice acting isn't the same ... Usually it's just distracting from the story... Just saying."
"Negative","This machine is just WRONG. KAPUT. NO FUNCIONA.: I have had the machine for over a year. I think you need to take a college graduate course to understand the manual. I have read and reread it many times. We finally accomplished recording to the DVD. Forget about any onscreen help. That doesn't exist. I am usually pretty technical having a experience as an electronics technician and as a computer LAN administrator. This machine is just plain frustrating. I tried to figure out the VCR section and preprogram a channel for recording a later time. Yeah...I have to take another college course for that too. My parents were looking to buy a DVD/VCR combo. I will steer them away from a Magnavox as far I can. Please do yourself a favor and spend a little extra money on something else. However, if you want to torture yourself then you can buy this and give yourself a migraine. Anything has to be better than this machine."
"Positive","Absolutely Intelligent Humor: The funniest book yet I've read in 1997.The humor certainly is quite ""tongue and cheek"" at times and the book is written in a way that seem Carlin is entertaining right in your own home !A must read!Jessica Cossaboom (jdcoss.hotmail.com"
"Positive","Professional and expert guidance!: The information in this book is slightly hard to read, due to technical language, however, the content is thorough and very useful for the new aquarist. Covers only the essentials for tank set-up, but gives thoroughly detailed information about the different aspects of fish keeping. The authors have a genuine care for fish, and this is reflected in their writing of fish keeping standards. Very professional/practical advice."
"Positive","In glorious black and white: The film opened to what seemed to be a model town complete with a toy automobile or two. But, this was the release which put Alfred back into film production.The viewing gets off to a slow start. In fact, if you are a first time viewer, you may wish to download the Wikipedia summary and character credits.But,the film has it all: A strangled guitar player, pre-WWII spies of dubious allegiance, doctored drinks, an ersatz nun who switches sides, a shootout in the woods, a happy ending, several laughs, and folks who insist upon opening the sash, even though they are in the middle of winter. And, of course, the vanishing lady...Watch for Alfred, as our heroic couple debark the train.An enjoyable film which picks up steam as it goes. Viewing and sound quality are quite adequate.One reviewer objected to commentary on the second disc, but the easy solution is not to view it."
"Positive","Arrresting: Excellent! If you enjoy masterful musicianship this is a must see. Summers is magnificent on guitar, Sting is a virtuoso on bass and his voice sounds impeccable and Copeland is wondrous on the drums."
"Positive","great kitchen: It took my husband a few hours to put it together, but nothing was too difficult and the results are great. My 16-month-old loves it and she'll have years of play, as she has plenty of room to grow. Good price point, compared to some other kitchens out there and the size is terrific. I highly recommend it!"
"Negative","The book was hard to follow: I have read some of Deepak's work that was good and easy to follow. This one was not in that category. I will seek recommendations from friends next time."
"Negative","on the road to freedom: this was just an average cd. the song so sad is the best one on it. i had not heard of any of the other songs. this was more of a folk album. i like some folk music but this was not too good."
"Negative","The Bore and the Drag on: I give. After taking 1028 pages to tell a 350 page story, I wave the white flag of surrender. Clancy clearly doesn't trust his reader base to remember characters from one book to the next. Hence, ever expanding tomes of work. We all know who Ryan is and how he got there. We Jackson, the Foleys, Sandbox and the rest. Why retell all their stories. There was a great story buried in this novel. They say the devil is in the detail and Clancy shows us hell. The only reason I finished the book was to write this review. I'd give it a zero but not an option. Isn't he supposed to have an editor to save him from himself?"
"Positive","The best you can buy: I have had this board for about 4 years I mostly play cricket. I haven't had to rotate it yet, and have had probably less than 10 board induced bounce outs. I love this board and have turned my friends on to this it, all I had to do was invite them over and the board spoke for itself"
"Negative","broke during 4th week of use: I thought this brush would be great...my last one from OXO lasted a few years. But this time I used it the way I normally use dishwashing brushes (not too vigorously), and the rubber button you press with your thumb to dispense the soap pushed completely through and is now permanently broken and useless. Complete waste of the money I spent on this brush, and on the 2 brush refills that I bought separately."
"Negative","ZUNE 30 GB Beware the screen cracks easily: the heading is the story. I bought 2 and treated them gently - gave it a nice plastic case and treated it like all my other MP3 players but within one month both are being returned and I am hoping that Microsoft won't declare I was a bad Zune owner.I don't know how this scrren compares to others but as an owner of an IRiver 20 gb I can tell you this is a much more delicate player then others I owned."
"Negative","strap is crap: Should have read the reviews. But since my husband was happy with his Timex Ironman, I thought I'd try one too. After only 6 months of use ( and only on weekends), the watch part popped out of the strap support, and just doesn't stay in place when you try to hook it back in. The watch may keep on ticking, but the strap is useless, effectively making the whole watch useless."
"Negative","ONE FUNCTION ONLY: The Pyranna opens most clamshells (it failed at several) and it DOES NOT open boxes/cartons; it cannot snip wire ties; does NOT slice open a cd wrapper. Not highly recommended as a do-all opener."
"Negative","Achitectual Graphic Standards: The reprsentation was not clear this is a reproduction of a 1935 published book. This is not usefull in todays building enviroment."
"Positive","Great bowls: I love these, I love all the Le Creuset Products, it is the Quality I like. These meet the usual standards. Heavy, easy to use, great in the micro or oven. Nice for serving a large bowl of soup or baking a small casserole for 1 or 2."
"Positive","No problems at all: Like all hornady stuff well made feeds cases with out a problem, easy to change out, looks like it will last a life time."
"Positive","Anakin Mini Light Saber: We bought 4 mini light sabers - Anakin, Obi-wan, Luke and Yoda. They are all very nice - well made and solid. Anakin is our favorite one because it is very shiny and the details are so well done. It looks just like the larger ones and the one in the movie. It looks very real and is quite heavy."
"Negative","Black Oak: This would be a good album if the recording were even fair, too bad, it's really really bad!!! Pick another album with the same songs on it, there are plenty of them out there."
"Negative","BORING!: Don't bother with this book - and I've read other Randy Alcorn books that I've liked. This book is 500 pages and could have been 100 - it is extremely redundant. Much of the content is either speculative or insignificant - i.e., Will We Tell Stories in Heaven or How Will Humans and Animals Relate in Heaven? It's not worth your time or money."
"Negative","Was hoping it would work but no such luck: After reading the reviews and seeing it was on sale, I thought I'd give it a try. The product seems to be made well and the heat was not a problem at all, no discomfort. The problem for me is, that it just doesn't seem to work for me. I get the occasional blemish and it's never cystic acne or blackheads like the product says it does NOT help. My blemishes that have surfaced have not disappeared any quicker, the device didn't take the inflamation down nor did it get rid or make the inflamation any less painful. In my opinion you'd be better off with an inexpensive facial steamer. all the device does is heat the area of the blemish and it seems you could get the same effect with a facial steamer that emits warm moisture. Sadly I'll be returning the item and will continue my search that can truly help with acne without chemicals."
"Negative","Peter Smith hardcover WARNING!: If you're considering buying the Peter Smith ""edition"" of this book, note that it is NOT a new ""edition"" in hardcover but the Vintage International edition rebound in red cloth, with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front. It looks like it's been rebound for libraries, not for sale to the general public. Amazon haven't seen fit to warn you of this, alas. The book is WELL-REBOUND, and may still be worth it to you Cormac McCarthy diehards out there -- it is for me, and ultimately I'm just gonna keep the copy of it I bought, but it's still quite disappointing. Thought you deserved a warning, hope it came in time."
"Negative","Why is there alarm on this thing?: I took four stars off because I just do not like other programming options on the stopwatch like setting an alarm, having time display on it, and just having the thing to constantly be on. As a key-chain item it gets all programmed by itself when you have it in your pocket and I find it a hassle every time I take it out to just get out of the programming mode into a stopwatch mode. It's also very annoying when the alarm starts beeping after it gets programmed in the pocket.Why not just make a durable key chain stopwatch without any other additions? I have not met anyone who wakes up to an alarm off their key-chain..."
"Positive","simply amazing: now i'm not sure if you're not a star wars fan whether you'll like this game or not. graphics and gameplay wise this is a very good game. so you don't have to be a star wars fan to enjoy this title. if you've got a great sound system then you'll enjoy this game even more (whether you're playing on a home theater system or console speakers with a sub). you can't play this game on a tv with the sound coming from the tv, it's just not right. either use good headphones or get a decent speaker set up going because this is one game you don't want to miss out on with the whole experience!"
"Positive","A good family movie: The music, cars, homes, hair styles and clothes etc bring back the memories of 1970's as this is the year setting for Super 8 (the ""8"" standing for 8mm). This would be good movie for the entire family to watch on a Friday or Saturday night."
"Positive","adding my 2 cents: There have already been plenty of reviewers of The Chronicles of Prydain, but I wanted to add just a couple thoughts:The 5 books are a pleasurable romp through Prydain, a place I might like to visit myself. Taran and his companions are quite likable and engaging, and their adventures are interesting and fun to follow.My only objection is that Lloyd Alexander doesn't do bad guys very well. At the various points in the stories where villians play a visible role, I found myself scoffing quite a few times at the silly monologuing and posturing.But these books are for kids, so I won't complain too much.All in all many hours of pleasurable reading."
"Negative","The top is Plastic: I believed this was galvanized steel receptacle - not plastic with a cheap made bucket. I could have purchased something much cheaper and had the same look/feel. The bucket does not feel like Steel and the thing is light - more like aluminum. Maybe I misunderstood what 'Poly' meant - that's a mistake I won't make again. I purchased 2 of these items for a state building - hopefully, they last longer than a few months. I don't recommend if you are like me, looking for something durable made of steel."
"Positive","Info about the free masons: Nicely written and truly comprehensive book. Since I'm from Sweden and belong to the Swedish freemasons I could have wished for a chapter about our system also. But on the whole this is a very informative book that I can recommend to both masons and to those who are generally interested in the subject.Jan Malmsjö, master mason"
"Positive","This book has made me a lot of money!: I purchased this book less than a year ago and using the advice of the author I have made enough money in real estate investing to quit my job and do it full time. I have read dozens of books on the subject and found this to be by far the most helpful. It is easy to read and gives a lot of specific, useful advise."
"Positive","It Works if You Work It: What a great find! This books has simplified the 12 Steps while not taking away the principles. It has been great in taking meetings to prisons, shut-ins, and others with whom we have a limited time frame. Many of us are using it with new sponsees after reworking the program ourselves using the guidelines set forth in this book. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in grasping and understanding this incredible program."
"Positive","A Savage and Wonderfully Evil book!: First off, I love horror fiction. I head to the bookstore about twice a month here in town, but I shop online bookstores far more often. I stummbled upon Black Moon Rising while browsing the horror section and ordered it based on the description.When I received my order in the mail I read BMR second. After reading the first five pages I couldn't put it down. The characters and dialogue were funny in a disturbing way, a way that doesn't rob the integrity of the work as a whole. The pace is relentless, it keeps building from start to finish. The violence is graphic and terrifyingly believable.If you haven't been scared to the bone before or if it's been awhile then you definitely need to check this book out. Top notch."
"Positive","Perfect!: I purchased this radiator for my 2000 VW GTI VR6 and it fit like a glove! The product was shipped to me EXTREMELY fast. Great price for a replacement radiator, especially when the dealer is selling it for $250! Highly recommended."
"Negative","Save your money: I purchased this stain remover with great excitement. When it arrived our housekeeper could not wait to use it as she loves laundry. It does not remove stains as well as the inexpensive stain remover you buy in the grocery store.I called customer service at Black and Decker and what a nightmare. In order to send it back you must send in the cord with $5.00 (can you believe that??) and you will not get a refund but just another one of the Stain Busters. They also wanted my credit card number...unbelievable.I hope to hear from someone who has used it successfully and maybe this one is faulty."
"Positive","Quest of the Well of Souls: To fully enjoy this book requires the reading of the prior books in sequence. The writer has an extraordinary ability to weave a complex tale that keeps the reader's interest from the first to last page."
"Positive","Nice product.: Bought it for my son, when I bought the camera. He was really pleased and it is very handy when he goes snowboarding at the mountains, very handy! Quick delivery."
"Positive","Not Everyone Is Ready For This Music: ""Have You Forgotten"" is worth the price of admission. Buy this album for this contemporary classic and roll forward with the rest of the CD like you were meant to. When all is said and done you will wish you had found Mark( the creative genius behind all of this) a whole lot sooner. Incidentally, if you want an even more melodic version of ""Have You Forgotten"" then you will have to buy the soundtrack to the film ""Vanilla Sky"". You should own them both!!"
"Negative","A disappointment: An interesting premise but clumsily executed. Reads almost like a draft. Characters are undeveloped, motivations are not plausible and main character, Ella, comes across as decidedly whiny, self-centered and not particularly likeable.Chevalier clearly overcame the problems evident in this first novel with her second book (the third was good but less successful). I wonder if this one wasn't rushed into print based on the success of ""Pearl Earring""."
"Positive","Well, Lynsay is back with another delightful tell.: Well, Lynsay is back with another delightful tell.After her brother's nearly fatal wounding, she flees the hills of her Highlands and finds herself captured by a well-muscled Scotsmen.Little did she know the Scotsman was bent on revenge. Laird Galen MacDonald's wife was murdered nine months before by his enemy, Laird MacGregor. When Galen learns that the MacGregor plans to take an English woman as a bride, he decides to get his revenge by stealing her and marrying her himself.Lynsay's character is no weak-willed miss, and while thrilled she is saved from having to marry the MacGregor, she plans a little revenge of her!!Lynsay proves once again she is a writer that delivers!!!"
"Negative","Tried hard...: Tried hard, but it just didn't do it!Kept reading and actually had to turn the page to keep going...In my humble opinion, Write one yourself, before you buy this...."
"Negative","Never received: I ordered France and France Magazine subsriptions at the same time a year ago. I really like ""France"" but have never received an issue of ""France Magazine"". When I went to re-subscribe, I noticed last year's order. OK - so I'm not always on top of things..."
"Positive","Great Deal: This face wash smells great and seems to ""thoroughly"" clean my face, however I don't like the consistency. It is very watery. The quantity is a good deal for the price but I find myself using more than usual due to the consistency. I might switch back to aveda. Great face wash if your on a budget."
"Positive","great for a unit on flight: Amelia Earhart Free in the Skies is a comic book style biography. We learn lots of neat thing about Amelia in this book. We learn that she made roller caosters in her own back yard with her sister. We learn about the ways she learn to fly and about her famous flights. Through out the book there are also facts mentioned about the Wright Brother and Charles Linburg.I like that the book was written in a comic book style. Sometimes kids feel like biography are boing. This format spices things up a bit making them enjoy the reading. The illustation are also interesting to look at as they read.I would recommed this book to reader ages 8-11. The books tells just enough about the Amelia Earheart without overwhelming the reader with details. It would make a great book to read during a unit on flight."
"Negative","The cost matches the quality: Don't waste your money on this. Terrible sound quality, skips constantly when the car engine is on. There is virtually nothing about this product that makes it a good deal."
"Positive","The Sin City Legacy: I admit having found this hard to come-by but was pleased to eventually recieve it because Sinners and Saints is a dark comic in unique style both artistic and story based. the stark black and white images with limited use of colour provides a nice alternative to the over-coloured world other titles may portray.The story is interesting and seedy and reminds me of frank millers Sin City books it is an overall good title and worth the investment though perhaps not if you live in the UK"
"Positive","This book enriches your family nights: I read this book and think it's wonderful. Many of the games and activities Carolyn lists have been enjoyed for several generations and are still entertaining children today. Because when you think about it, kids haven't really changed...They still love these games and always will for years to come! It's nice to get them away from the video and computer screens and just enjoy a good family bonding with lots of laughs. I also use this book to get game ideas for my scout den, sleepovers, and church functions. Carolyn's a fantastic writer who uses the right balance of humor and wisdom to capture a wide audience from 10 to 100. Hats off to her talent!"
"Negative","too serious,too mandane,too nasal--shame Bocelli: I am a Bocelli fan and a lover of opera. I purchased his new cd with gusto and I am very disappointed. The music ,selection of songs were like depressants(and I do not do drugs). No variation of sound or voice. Whats going on?>?Did the artist have a cold.He sounded very nasal and it was very annoying especially since I can't return the cd. I think it is awful and Irritating."
"Positive","I thought it was cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I thought this was a good album(very very good).I admit the only reason I bought the cd was because Madonna had a duet on the album.But I finally after a week talked myself into listening to it and I'm so glad I bought it.It was the best album of 1999 and his second cd I got for Christmas and loved it too.I think everyone should have a chance to listen to this.You don't know what your missing out on.""Thumbs Up!"""
"Negative","From loathing to love in record time.: I have read everything Holt has written but have been let down by her last two novels. I love a good erotic read as much as the next, however, there needs to be some redeeming qualities in the leads. The heroine went from loathing the hero to loving him within the first few chapters. The hero, was not far behind.I felt no build-up at all and their love was not at all convincing. They were in love because the author *tells* us they are. I was left scratching my head in wonder how this man who was so disreputable fell in love and lust so quickly. I ended up stopping halfway through in frustration as I could see where the predictable plot was going.I recommend *Love Lessons* and *Total Surrender* for spicy Cheryl Holt reads."
"Negative","Boring: Nothing new here. Huge disappointment. Letters are all clichéd generalizations. Sure wish I had my money back."
"Negative","Second rate: This is the least durable knife I own. The edge does not keep and is easily notched. Ironically, the benefit of ""Damascus"" steel is its durability and tendency to hold a very fine edge. This is a pretty knife (if you don't count the notches), but the merits end there. I'm afraid my faith in Calphalon is now diminishing with every product I buy. Poor pans, poor knives."
"Negative","Good idea, poor execution: I really wanted to be able to enjoy this flick, but alas, no such joy. The concept generally includes the outcast kid who is obviously picked on by everyone, dies, and somehow inhabits the body of a scarecrow, and thereby wreak havoc on all who wronged him. Fun idea. Sadly, though, the execution was very week. Its obviously low budget, which is not bad per se, but with the low budget comes poor directing - lots of very empty filler camera shots that go nowhere. But then the scarecrow goes very ninja - weird. Worth a rental, but that's it."
"Positive","Donkey Kong Country: I got dk country last year.It is the BEST game I have ever played.It also has the best graphics.so if your a Donkey Kong lover BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Positive","Light as air: I prefer air mattresses or sleeping pads. Comfort is the main reason with light carrying weight a very important consideration for me when I backpack. Light and it packs small. A winning combination. Love it!Blow it up until it is rigid, stuff it under your sleeping bag in your bivvy sack (you should always have one of those - tents leak), and you will not bottom out if you are a normal weight. Just a few minutes of blowing into the metal valve at the head (unscrew first) will do it, then tighten the valve. Voilà!I suggest the long size. I am about six feet tall but was glad for the extra inches. Suggestion: get an air PILLOW too. If you like the Big Agnes, there is the little Agnes pillow:Big Agnes Clearview Air PillowThis what I prefer although (or perhaps because) I have a foam core and a thin foam in an air mattress. Both take up an enormous amount of space, weigh more, and give no better support.RECOMENDED."
"Positive","Info packed!: Although a few years old now this book is full of great information. I borrowed one from a friend and loved it so much I ordered my own. Highly recommended for detailed information on bird habitat and behavior."
"Positive","great sound and comfort!: I have always preferred the vertical in-the-ear style headphones since they were first introduced in the late 80's. These headphones are very comfortable to wear for several hours at a time. You will barely feel them. That's great, but how do they sound? They have excellent frequency response at 10 - 23,000Hz, and great sensitivity at 108 dB/mW. You will get good bass out of the tiny 16mm drivers. They are also water resistant, so you can wear them while exercising or in the rain. They are designed so the moisture will run down the band and drip off the bottom. I highly recommend these portable (and foldable) headphones."
"Negative","Penn State Puzzle is old.: This puzzle is a picture of the old Beaver Statium before additions were put on. I thought I was getting a puzzle of the current (2009) Beaver Stadium, so I was disappointed when I received it."
"Negative","Sooo not funny: I picked up this book hoping for some delightful romantic comedy to read before bed. However, after the opening scene where she wakes up married to her childhood friend & pregnant, I got a never ending tale of how tragic Paris's childhood was and how she was terrified of hurting her child like her Mother's Post partum depression hurt Paris & her baby sister. Post partum is bad & I'm gonna have it so I have to walk away from my husband and child so I can save them. Are you getting the idea? It was such a good idea & it just plops on the floor. Seriously, how many pages can a woman read about how horrifying Post partum depression is & how the heroine doesn't want to keep her kid because she might get it too.... (Please pardon the run on sentences, but I really needed to vent--I feel much better now.)"
"Positive","Patio umbrella review (sort of): The umbrella I ordered is fine, just what I had hoped it would be. However, I subsequently ordered an umbrella stand (after you prompted me to do so) and when it arrived the two tightening screws in the shaft had been damaged in shipment. Each of the screws have plastic knobs and the knobs were broken off. As a result when one tightens them the broken plastic is sharp enough to cut skin. I have tried unsuccessfully to find replacements at a hardware store. Any suggestions?"
"Positive","Good Product: I am very convinced this product is very well made.I like everything about.I will tell my friends about it.Good job."
"Positive","The Most Original SciFi Author Now Writing: What John Varley was to the 1970s and early 1980s, Greg Egan is to the 1990s and 2000s: An author who thinks about what it will be like for the human mind and soul to encounter the technological advances that can change the nature of consciousness itself. After reading a story like one of these you are too stunned to think, because the concepts themselves are so mind-blowing. This book, by the way, is only the beginning: Egan's later stories (many of which can be found in Gardner Dozois's annual collections of science fiction) and Egan's novels (especially Diaspora) show more of the same."
"Negative","Hopelessly terrible: This is the worst Cure release ever. When you watch this you'll be saying to yourself ""Where are the keyboards???"". It's a shame the band got rid of Roger, he is sorely missed. Bringing back guitarist Porl Thompson does nothing for the band here either. He offers nothing new or interesting and doesnt do any better of a job than recently sacked guitarist Perry Bamonte. The songs on here are mangled, lifeless and boring. Pick up the Trilogy DVD to truely see the once great Cure live. Avoid this dog like the plague."
"Positive","Gives one explanation of a very complex issue: The Boxer Rebellion is clearly a turning point in Chinese history. Various explanations of the persons behind the uprising. Of particular interest is the role of the Dowager Empress in supporting the Boxers. Even the title of the book is a rewrite of popular terminology. The common term has been Boxer Rebellion but this work uses the word ""uprising."" This is a must read for anyone wanting a better understanding of Chinese nationalism."
"Positive","great rendition of this play: Love the way they did this one! One of my favorite Shakespeare plays. TE"
"Negative","Wrong product: I ordered the 8.5 oz bottle of Bain de terre rinse and shine white willow volumizing foam however I received a 6.7 oz bottle of Bain de terre rise and shine volumizing foam. The product sent to me did not have the white willow in it. I like the one that was sent though too."
"Negative","To clear matters up...: A previous viewer wrote that Jesus did not come from the bloodline of David..Oh, what ignorance! MARY was a descendant of David's, not Joseph! This book just goes to show what garbage people will write with enough time on thier hands. Remember, #1 selling book of all time,written for more than 100 languages, THE BIBLE! I don't think the author takes that into consideration, unless he thinks the majority of this planet is that naive."
"Positive","KH 2 Strategy Guide: Over 340 pages amazing artwork,detailed Walkthrough,explanations of every accessories,items&enemys; and there are only few spoilers.You get to know the Story of KH 1 and KH CoM,it's like a short summary of what happened earlier to Sora&Co.;You also get a detailed explanation of what Nobodies&Heartless; are,but if you are looking for a detailed character explanation of Organization XIII you won't find it here :(The bad thing is that the minigames are scattered everywhere and you must look for every single one,which takes a lot of time(big book!) and the character profiles are very short...Not one of the greatest strategy guides,but neither a bad one!"
"Negative","Junk - You get what you pay for.: Our office ordered two of these fans. One didn't work right out of the box. Had to return it for another one. Now, about 1 year later, both the replacement fan and the second one completely broke down and stopped working. So, that's 3 fans broken in less than a year. They did not receive very heavy use either. Only used for a short while when it was extremely hot. Can't be trusted - look somewhere else."
"Negative","600-Thread Sheets: I was disappointed in 1) The color wasn't what I wanted, I wanted cafe brown, not gold...2) The sheets don't feel like they are 600-Thread countI would not buy these kind of sheets again.But there are okay.."
"Positive","Spice!: I think this movie is great! it first came out when i was 2, and i remember all the time i wanted to watch it. just last year i saw it in the first in 9 years! all those GREAT song like ""Too Much"" and ""Stop!"". i also had ""Spice Girls: One Hour of Girl Power"" and my mum and dad used to put it on when i was born! i still reckon the spice girls are great and i cant belive that i forgot all about them! My Cousin just reminded my about them at my other cousins birthday. my favourite song would have to be ""Who Do You Think You Are"""
"Positive","MyShelf.com Book Reviewer: I was astonished at the vast amount of invaluable information I found in the pages of COMMONS HERBS FOR NATURAL HEALTH (Herbals of Our Foremothers) by Juliette de Bairacli Levy. Readers will be rewarded by a detailed listing of 200 worldwide herbs. You will learn how to find them, store them, and prepare them to help treat many common ailments. Don't be surprised if the recipes contained in the back of the book will have you searching your yard late at night for the intriguing ingredients.This book is a must-read for any herbalist enthusiast, or anyone who has a slight interest in alternative medicine. I can easily see this book being passed on from generation to generation; the information is priceless. After reading this treasure, it fully convinced me to change the topic of my college thesis. I'm happy to say I couldn't have read any better book to start me on the path of learning this ancient tradition."
"Negative","Terrible reception: We bought this phone system knowing that Panasonic is a decent brand, but were completely disappointed. The phones have a terrible static noise and calls fade in/out. I looked in the manual for troubleshooting tips and it suggested moving the phones away from other electric devices, which I did, but it didn't help at all.What good are all the other great features if the basic reception is not there?"
"Negative","Awful: Inconsistent quality and freshness.The first time I received the Lyons they were fresh yet in pieces, we ate the pieces since they tasted good..The next shipment was not fresh and did not taste good. Complete waste of money because they are still sitting in my pantry. Very disappointing.Unfortunately I am discovering that amazon is hit or miss on grocery items as of right now."
"Positive","great quality: This belt is very well made and really beautiful. The color though is nothing like shown, it is much, much darker."
"Negative","Bad.: Ok I'm sorry but the anime for Negima is really bad. Poor quality, doesn't stick to the story line, and the worst ending ever leave much to be desired. Now this is kinda upsetting coming from Xebec who also did the animation for Love Hina. Akamatsu was even disgusted with the anime and how it turned out. I would not reccomend buying this anime but instead buying and reading the manga which is a whole lot better."
"Negative","Terrible: Everything people are saying about this ""vacuum"" is absolutely true. I have hated mine since about the second time I used it. It really does throw dirt back at your feet as you use it and it leaves piles of dirt behind when the motor is shut off. The suction is also terrible; I just had one hell of a time trying to vacuum up a very small pile of paper remnants that fell to the floor as I was emptying my shredder.(It never did get everything, I had to pick up the last pieces of paper with my fingers!) Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this ...thing. I will never buy another Eureka product again after this."
"Positive","Clasp is tough, but lovely-looking, great price: The clasp on this watch is really hard to get open when it's on my wrist. I had three links taken out so I don't know if that has anything to do with it. Other than that, it's a lovely elegant watch for a great price."
"Negative","Brief review: Apparently, Robert Altman is only interested in watching his actors move: during ballet performances, ballet practice -- even outside of the ballet company (i.e. the relationship between a ballet dancer and a chef is more action-oriented than talky). There's very little talking and very, very little character development, purposely, sadly. (You know as much about the characters here as you know about the people performing in a ballet play.) The Company is really a silent film with a few droplets of dialogue -- a joke if you ask me. Unfortunately, I was never engaged by the performances (the first one came close, though). Fans of ballet should get something out of it, though."
"Positive","the greatest album ever made: the dark side of the moon was one of the most succesful albums ever made along with hotel california and should be there in your collection along with the wall.very highly recommended."
"Negative","Skip this, watch the Anime series: The Anime gave you amazing character buildup and it was a show adults could enjoy. This movie belongs in Mystery Science Theatre 3000.We need a REAL director to step in and re-do this movie. M. Night Shymalan should be ashamed.We need Guillermo Del Torro and Peter Jackson to come in and save this.For Now STICK TO THE ANIME ONLY!!!"
"Positive","Worth reading,fun,insiteful,eye opening.: One of my favorite parts of studying Freudian Psychology was his ideas on interpertations on dreams. I also enjoyed reading in the bible the importance of dreams and thier peering into the future. I didn't of course agree 1005 with all Freud had to say nor Lund but it makes for great reading and sparks the mind that there are some who do dream dreams as Joseph did in the bible and so too there are others. I am a bleiver to that dreams do have meanings to be explored, others are for pure enjoyment. Like my flying dreams and teaching others to fly, there is nothing sexual about them, or out of the body, just lots of fun.I do like to the alphabetical arrangement of dreams,Lund uses."
"Positive","Car Charger: The charger appears to be well made. It does not look like a cheap imitation. As far as performance goes, I've only used this charger a few times on one long road trip to charge a Samsung SGH-A707 cell phone battery, and so far had no problems with it. So with this limited usage it's hard to tell what the charger lifetime and reliability will be, but so far so good."
"Negative","Where are the Beastie Boys?: Wow, have these guys fallen, this is by far the worst Beasties Cd (and I own all of them). Most of the tracks are just flat out annoyingly bad (""Check It Out"" is good? C'mon...) The song ""an open letter to NYC"" tries to suck up to the 911 tragedy, nice try boys but next time why dont you release a song like that sooner. This CD is very very old skool beatish but it's lacking that Beastie edge from all of the previous CD's. Guess the grey hair is getting to them, time to retire boys if you going to produce more schlock like this, I want my money back."
"Negative","no pretty: This was the cheapest thing I ever bought in my life, saw the reviews. well not sure what they got but mine was a hunk of junk. next time I will learn buy from a furniture store..."
"Negative","Not what I expected: I was not able to use any ideas in this book as it already had a theme that the crafts were based on. I was hoping for something that related to stories from the Bible or open ended crafts."
"Negative","Basic Lock, broke in less than a year: This is slightly smaller than standard U Lock, but it's pretty standard overall. I found that about six months after purchase it began to become temperamental -- I would have to jiggle the lock to make it work or turn the key several times until it finally opened -- and in less than a year the key broke off in the lock, rendering the lock useless. I would find another lock with reviews that list it as sturdy."
"Negative","A collection of old info with a lot of biases: This is an okay book if you already have several others and want another viewpoint. It should NOT be the only book you buy. There are too many errors and strong biases scattered throughout to make it a one-source reference. Freedom of the Hills (latest edition) is still a better resource if you're just going to have one. The Houston/Cosley book is more up to date and better researched. Twight's book is getting dated but still has good info for those who are pushing harder."
"Positive","Buy it.: Debbi Mack has written a satisfying suspense novel that introduces Sam McRae as a hero worth following. I haven't yet read her next adventure,Least Wanted, but I will, and I encourage all who read this to do the same. Sam is a workhorse, a former lawyer and now PI who is simultaneously working on her own identity theft issues as she helps her client with a murder investigation. This is a book with many plot twists, including a big one at the ending. I never felt it took advantage of me with convenient solutions or contrived problems, like many of this genre do. Tightly written and good fun."
"Negative","Shameless reissue: This ""special edition"" reissue contains no new material than what has already been released in the previous box sets (I own all three). Beware of a ""greatest hits"" of Bond movies, as there are several good movies missing from here, including the the 19th flick, The World is Not Enough."
"Positive","Most memorable book of my childhood: I discovered this book while I was in the 6th grade (many years ago!) and checked it out to reread every time I found it in a school or public library for years afterward. It is so well written, poignant, and heartbreaking that all these years later I still get a catch in my throat when I think of that old knight. I shared it with every child I could over the years, writing to local libraries to find one who still had a copy to borrow.I am so glad that, now I have the chance to share it with grandchildren, it magically has appeared again in print.Margaret Lovett, thank you so very much for creating this story that has meant so much to me over the years. I have been a voracious reader all my life, and very few books have captured my heart like this story. This is a masterpiece, for boys and for girls!"
"Negative","Scepter Gas Cans: Don't buy. Never work properly. Spout will go bad within months. Major step backwards. Poured gas back in my 20 year old container and through away."
"Negative","poor construction: bought this toy at target today for half the price that it's listed on amazon which i thought was a plus, turns out it was all just a waste of time. the washer they provide to secure the pedal to the pedal bar doesn't allow the pedal to rotate so my daughter had to take her feet off the pedals half way through the motion on every rotation of the pedal. the end caps they provide for the rear axle are weak and aside from one breaking today i'm sure they would've fallen off soon (they don't clip onto anything it's just a tight fit). i wouldn't recommend buying this for any price, it's not worth anything if your kids can't ride it."
"Positive","Unusual and rewarding: Art Nouveau covers a wide range of styles and so you are not likely to love (eg) Klimt or Mucha as much as you do (oh, and I do!) Charles Rennie Mackintosh or Beardsley - or vice versa - but this book manages to accurately and effectively translate their art into stitch. Barbara Hammet has done a marvelous job here - and her Mackintosh Rose is a delight both to stitch and to see on my favourite cushion. Nice selection of borders later in the book, too. I suppose the only reason I give 4, and not 5 stars is that I have to admit I really don't like Klimt (my son Renny will kill me). A lovely book with lots of artist background too. ."
"Negative","Waste of space and money!: This set looks like a lot of fun, but it is just not all I expected, nor what my kids like. The parts come off way to easily (ie: the ferris wheel and swings), the cars do not do the loopydyloop very well, leading to frustration, you have to get it on JUST RIGHT and even than...it doesn't usually work, even for an adult. This toy is hardly ever played with, it lost its appeal the week that my daughter got it for her first birthday a year ago and has hardly been touched since. Usually the little people sets have been a winner, but this one is not worth the money and space it takes up. Unfortunately it is rather large, and when a toy that large is not played with...well I consider it a waste of space. The Little People Farm set is played with on regular basis as well as the bus and safari set. We have the sets from a few years ago when Fisher price didn't have to put noises on ALL their toys! BUT, that is a pet peave that I won't go into today."
"Positive","Wonderful Format: Beautiful illustrations, but the morals at the end don't always seem to fit the usually very brief story. So many of them are about pride and vanity. And where's the famous story of Androcles and the Lion? I give it four stars mostly because of the large size and large print and the illustrations, all of which should be pleasing to children. Those illustrations are wonderful. And I liked the font, which is very old-fashioned. This is a reprint of a book originally printed in 1914, and the publishers have kept that look. A good buy for your children, I should think. Children always love stories wherein animals talk, and are like people. This is the original. A good moral thrown in never hurts, either. E.g., ""A kindness is never wasted."""
"Positive","Worthwhile: An interesting character study. Jo is both alienating and magnetic. A complex character, she is Every Woman, her life so perfect. But with every page you realize how untrue that is. She's lost in herself, and her many roles, she feels that each aspect of her life is so seperate, yet so easily does she fall from one to another. Her almost reckless abandonment of one life, in her youth for another, shows an almost schizophrenic personality division. She is running away to find herself. And yet in middle age, when life is seemingly blissfull, she abandons the comfortable for the danger of the known past. So simply does the story unfold, with its onion-like layers, it makes you feel you should have seen this coming. Mid-life crisis was never so dramatic. The author conveys the message that life is a complex journey, lessons to be learned and everything that happens has a reason. If the lesson has not been learned, unresolved issues will come forward. Worthwhile read."
"Positive","is a stars light real: ""star light, star bright first star i see tonight' That starlight may well be a message from a long dead dot in space that burned itself out before our worlds existed. Its true. When you see a star's light, you don't even know if the sun that gives it to you exists anymore. Yet there it is, plainly, true light come to your eye from beyond time, beyond space, beyond imaginings. It is yours to do with as you choose. It is much the same with Opal's gift."
"Positive","Nothing less can be expected from Mouni Sadhu: This is one of those books that you always have handy... that you always go back and read, and read... A lot of (not found elsewhere) details about Sri Maharshi mixed with daily inspirational occurrences. A wonderful mix as it should be. Many questions are answered, every page is a fountain of knowledge. How did Mouni fit so much knowledge in so few pages?! Of course, you must slowly read it or you will pass it all! To give you an idea, I just opened the book randomly and it reads: ""It is tragic how we believe that our separateness is real, that what we have is our own, and so remain untouched by the needs of others"". I opened it again randomly: ""While one is immersed in water one cannot see anything above the water's surface. The world above is veiled from sight"". ""Thought must always have an object, however sublime it may be, thus there must always be two, not one. Therefore thought and its process is a blind alley"". I think you get the idea."
"Negative","Brilliant novel + Hollywood = loser: Dumas' novel is one of the great works of western fiction. The massive distortions of the original story in this movie do not serve any purpose other than to create a Hollywood ending. Athos played as grumpy and poor by John Malkovich? This has got to be one of the strangest mis-casting decisions of all time! D'Artagnan as the king's father! These are really bizarre choices that are unnecessary. I can see Hollywood massively rewriting a story that is half-baked, but why trash one of the greatest stories of all time? Do we really need every story to have an impossible series of coincidences and end with a smiley face? This adaptation is an insult to viewers brought to us by people too lazy and condescending to care about quality. Waste of a great book and a great cast. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
"Positive","Dine, A History of the Navajos: A very well written book. The author did a great job putting it tobgether. If you want to know about the Navajo I would recommend the book."
"Positive","A Remarkable Book: I thoroughly enjoyed Angela's Ashes. Even though he had a terrible childhood Frank McCourt was able to keep his sense of humor and his humanity. I don't understand the reviews that said it was so sad they couldn't finish it. How can it be more sad for the reader than the man that wrote it. He was able to find reasons to laugh in every one of his awful situations (expect maybe when his siblings died).I liked that he showed us the hypocracy and hatefulness of the Catholic church and some of the elders in his life. With all this negativity in his life it is amazing he was able to keep his dreams alive."
"Positive","As advertised and great price: Exactly as presented, and at a great price. All seem well made and easy to use. Very bright colors, good and reusable container."
"Positive","Music that gets you through the day...: This album is hot, when I first heard the song Lo Hechamos A Suerte I couldn't get it out of my head--my friends and I couldn't stop singing it! The lyrics to these songs actually make sense, and they're poignant without being mushy and overboard. Their voices are an awesome, grooving blend that'll take you from one mood to another. Great variety on just one CD!"
"Negative","This is terrible!!!: I have read all the Thoroghbred books up to number 25, and was very disappointed when heard about 'Christina' and her like of jumping. It seems that Cindy disappeared into to thin air. What happened here? I really miss reading the old series. Until the series returns to racing I have stopped reading, and I really think that the other author (Joanna Campbell) should return to writing, or stop putting her name on such lousy books. They were really gooo untill 'Cchristina' started. Thanks."
"Negative","Didn't Work: I got this to help keep my wig in place. It didn't work for me. Will try to find another use for it."
"Negative","what a crappy album: They were trying to make somthing new and different from Load/Reload and their earlier stuff, but they failed somewhere along the road. The drums especially sound really bad, like hitting on garbage cans, like Slipknot and other nu metal crap. Really they have to get back to their roots of the mid 80's to early 90's when they could be called one of the best heavy metal bands alongside Megadeth and Anthrax, etc."
"Negative","Hazards of Halogen Light: Light output excellent. But what happens if the motion-detector timer fails to shut off and the high-heat producing halogen bulb stays on?In my case, it caused the outer plastic housing to melt down and possibly to have caught fire, just two weeks after installed. Fortunately, it was self-limiting, but the heat blistered the paint on the wood siding on which the light was mounted. The siding could have, but did not, catch fire, or else the house could have burned down. The manufacturer said it shouldn't happen. But it did. And if it happened once, it can happen again."
"Positive","High Quality Nut Driver Set: This set was bought as a gift. It was perfect. The recipient had used this product at work so he knew the quality. Highly recommended! Excellent product."
"Negative","Absolutely Horrible: Nice cover, Slow and shallow plot with horrible voice over effects(I cant beleive someone was actually paid to do voices in monotone!). Controls and camera view are very clumsy and user-unfreindly. What on earth where the developers thinking??? Gabriel Knight was 1000 X's better than this game. I only wish I'd left it on the shelf. PS: I wrote a longer review but I couldnt find it posted, so I shortened this up a bit.Bill Negron AKA AceFreight"
"Negative","Looks good, plays badly!: I read the other reviews about the mechanical noises this DVD player makes while scanning the DVDs. I thought it was much to do about nothing, so I bought one anyway because of the long battery life and sleek look...but then I tried to play my first DVD! The other reviewers were not exaggerating! This thing could wake up a sleeping spouse with the mechanical noises it makes while it's thinking about whether it wants to play your disc or not! Eventually it started playing my DVD after 3o seconds or so. To be fair, it then played fine if you don't need to use the navigation buttons much. But if you need to go back to the main menu, etc, it is slow to respond to the buttons. I got really frustrated, and I am returining mine tomorrow!"
"Negative","FAKE MEMORY STICK: DONT BUY ANY OF THESE, THEY ARE COUNTERFEIT CHINA-MADE MEMORY STICKS AND WONT WORK AT ALL, I WASTED MONEY ON THIS DONT WASTE YOURS."
"Negative","Non-critical survey of dispersion models.: Zib writes what could easily have been a class notebook (about 100 pages) compilation of mathematical models used for urban atmospheric diffussion analysis. Each page details the mathematics of each model with little attention to critique or explaination.I give the book a thumbs up for detailing the full spectrum of models employed for the urban environment. In this respects, the reader has the opertunity to consider and compare different models. Unfortunately, there was no real practical knowledge departed on these models, nor a critical analysis of their use."
"Negative","A ""Hallmark"" Historical Novel: You could feel the author was uncomfortable with the tame sexual scenes and stretching to include sexual language. The book was overall too ""Hallmark"" for my tastes and Anne, far too whinie about ""do you love me"", do you really love me""?Not a bad book though, just not what I like to read. For a really juicy story, read Jackie Ivy's ""Lady of the Knight"", Sophia Johnson ""Risk Everything"", and Susan Carroll's ""Dark Queen Trilogy, not particulary in that order, S. Carroll's books first."
"Negative","Below Average: This book details the life of a KGB agent, his career in the organization and an overview of what they do and how they do it. It comes off as a very high level, average and uninspiring work. There is just nothing new here. The book was a little run of the mill. The story sounded like it would be full of interesting stories from this former KGB agent. We get some interesting details on how operations are planned and carried out, some detail on the trade craft and recruitment, but overall the wooden written and the lack of large amounts of new information make this a book only suited to someone that is really interested in learning everything they possibly can about the KGB. There are better books on this topic."
"Positive","Going! Going, Gone?: Last Chance To See, another wonderful display of Douglas Adams's depiction of dry humor and dark truth. Adams, zoologist Mark Carwardine, and a BBC reporter, travel to the outposts of the world searching for signs of life that are rare, exotic and endangered beings.I would have liked more photographs of animals and the environments Douglas describes. His superior descriptions and wordpainting placed me at his shoulder, but I love photos.I highly recommend this book to any soul interested in the survival of the world. After reading Last Chance to See, I became aware of the sad fact of how many florna and fauna we lose due to our negligence of our place. Very enlightening, Thanks Sutherland for the assignment.C.O.S. Giants"
"Positive","great band: Falling sickness are awesome...all cds are good...they are great punk with some edgy impossibles meet operation ivy ska tunes too...get it..u won't be dissappointed"
"Negative","Who's lame brain idea was this?: This first American Psycho was just this really wonderful mixture of suspense, horror, and comedy. Christain Bale gave this wonderful performance. I was bored and decided to rent a dvd. I saw American Psycho 2 the cover art alone had me sold. But it was very misleading this movie wasn't anything in any that the first one was. It's preditable with a weak plot. The dvd's extra aren't anything much either. The only thing I like about this movie were the few and far in between witty comments that Mila Kunis character (can't even remember her name) said. Other then that this movie was a big bust. So if you must see this movie. It's your best bet to rent it and not waste your money. But if you must buy it I'm sure it will just collect dust."
"Positive","A good book for children learning to read chapter books: This was one of the first chapter books I've read. The beginning of the story was a bit confusing because Richard, the main character, says ""the beast is home!"" He says the beast is home because people call him the beast! So the beast in the story is a little boy.In the story, it's almost Richard's birthday. He thinks that Holly, his big sister, and her friend Joanne, are making a party for him. [...]Richard and his best friend Matthew have to help bring a rabbit to the kindergarten spring play.It was a fun book to read."
"Positive","A Very Good Game.: This is a very good game (but not as good as FF9). I think it is better than FF7 (I just can't get into it as mutch). The characters are cool, sory is cool, and the GFs are AWSOME! (Cactuar is my favorite.) I will give my ratings from 1.0-10.0. Graphics-9.5 Controll-10.0 Sound-9.5 Replay-9.0 TOTAL SCORE-9.5"
"Negative","Thoughts on A Calculated Magic: Sadly both A Modern Magician & it's sequel A Calculated Magic have not aged well. They both feel very 80's"
"Positive","The cocktail book I turn to first: The chart in the middle of the book is invaluable. At a glance you can see what you can make with the ingredients on hand and confidentally experiment without straying too far off tried and true formulas (who knew the Sidecar and Margarita were related?)."
"Negative","Good IDE, very poor documentation: I learned programming with Borland Turbo Pascal and Turbo Assembler in the late '80s, continuing with Turbo C in the early '90s. After having spent a decade in the UNIX world, I recently returned to the PC, and did get the recent Turbo C++ when I discovered it.The IDE as such is very good. Both the development and debugging IDE configurations make perfect sense, and provide a very good work environment.The problem with Turbo C++ is the docmentation. It does not exist. There are no tutorials (that I can find), no code examples (that I can find), no example projects (that I can find). The documentation that does exists (well, that I do find) is short prose (~300-500 words) that state the obvious. There are the occational code snippets (<10 lines) in these pages, but the code is taken out of context and is thus not all that useful.Borland would do well to publish a couple of tutorials and developer's guides in conjunction with this product."
"Negative","A Quick Analogy: Once I ate a BBQ Pork sandwich, and boy it was really good. So good that I ate another one, and another and another. Finally after ten of the same BBQ Pork sandwiches they didn't taste quite as good. That doesn't mean it was bad, it just was not as good as the first one. I'm really not sure what the cook is doing in the back but next time I come to eat I may just order something else."
"Positive","WONDERFUL INSIGHT INTO THE INNER WORKINGS OF AN EVER SURPRISING TEAM: I will look at baseball with a new understanding. YOU WILL TOO! It was a fun read, entertaining and educational at the same time."
"Negative","Christmas Drivel: John Grisham must have need some extra cash to pump out thisboring ode to conformity. A couple decide to ""skip Xmas"" since their Peace Corps daughter will not be with them. Instead of enjoying a well deserved cruise, they are bullied by their sheep-like neighbors when they refuse to do what every other neighbor has done in their Stepford Wives community. When they lose their resolve and bail out of their cruise, we are delived a crummy ending by their totally spoiled adult child.Save your money. I'm a Grisham fan, but this reeks."
"Negative","Boorrrrrriiiiinng: I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away."
"Positive","Major difference in playing.: I purchased a replica' stradivari that came with starter bow, and starter rosin, with the starter strings. The rosin was hard to apply onto the bow, and required reapplying only after about 15-30seconds of playing. I purchased the ""Hill Dark Rosin"" and when I applied the rosin the first time I already was able to tell the difference. Each stroke of the bow on the rosin revealed marks on the rosin which means it was applying. The starter rosin never got marked up. After about 8 strokes of this rosin I was able to play the violin with a much better tone, and lots of less scratching. After this experience, I highly recommend this brand and type of rosin. I would buy more for myself, but I do not know how rosin ages."
"Negative","Very Inaccesible Book: Trotter is a spectacular chef and this book is an awesome reference for those who do nothing but cook. For anyone else, it's fairly useless.The problem is the complexity. I ran through my copy this morning and discovered that there's not a single recipe that does not feature a cross-reference to multiple recipes, some of which refer back to a preparation technique in the base recipe. For the sauce (separate recipe,) you need a stock (separate recipe,) containing a special spice sachet (separate recipe,) and---if making it together with recipe x, don't forget to prep component y between steps 3a and 3c, sub i. It's maddening---like standing between opposite mirrors.If you're a professional chef, it will make a nice addition to your reference shelf. For everyone else, steer clear."
"Negative","Volume in earpiece drops intermittently: After only the second time calling someone, their voice volume intermittently dropped so low on the phone (imagine trying to hear a mosquito's wing beat on the opposite side of a pane of glass) that I thought I had bumped a key with my face. Good to hear other reviewers had the same problem, as I still have enough time to return the phones to the store. Completely useless - the setup can't even operate as a phone with this problem - what a failure! Don't they test products anymore before selling them to the public?"
"Positive","B&D 24V Cordless Mower: I purchased this mower when my gas mower broke down. I am very pleased with its performance. I am able to mow my entire lawn twice without a recharge.When I received the mower I literally took it out of the box, attached the handle in 2 minutes & proceeded to mow my lawn. Adjusting the height of the mower is a simple 1 step process.No more pouring gas, checking oil or tuneups!"
"Positive","Cutting Edge Thriller. Smart, Fast Read.: Whew! I sat up all night with this one. Besides a plot that doesn't let up, this spooky, vivid tome is filled with very readable science. This CAN happen! Darnton is a terrifingly great writer. Eat your heart out Thomas Harris!"
"Negative","Hastily fabricated: Although the author claims to have high credentials, he presents very lousy descriptions of exercises, with complete disregard to grace or esthetics.As soon as you pass the well designed and colorful cover, you will be immersed in a collection of poorly sketched exercises. Each exercise is described in three or more steps, which provide no clue on the proper execution of exercise. Most of the exercise sketches are flawed and hint to the total lack of experience or exposure of the author to athletic performance.Although the book was first published in 1996, there were then reasonable level of technical skills and knowledge with publishing good illustrations that the author disregarded."
"Negative","The Old series is way Better: I personally don't like this movie. I like the old Star Wars much better. There are better special effects than these new ones. This movie should be setting the standards for graphics like the old ones did when they first came out. Again its my personal opinion."
"Negative","Why was this so big?: It is true that Usher CAN sing, but his voice could be lost in the army of male r&b singers. It is ordinary. The material - nothing really grounbreaking, same old topics, r&b cliches, no new beats, nothing very innovative. The image- nothing new, still the same old cocky, self absorbed guy. Now we get this useless re-issue, a way to cash in for BMG isn't it? The new tracks don't make up for the disaster and decpetive hype of this overrated album and artist."
"Positive","A great book on so many levels: I first read this book at a young age. I enjoyed it very greatly then. Not as an allagory for anything or as anything of that sort but as a story of adventure and survival. Recently I have read it with my english class and explored the symbolism and allegories. I think that the lord of the flies is a very strong book with a strong message that can be understood at many levels and I think that this is a book that ever family that enjoys reading should own. The Lord of the Flies can be enjoyed and reread by people of all ages and spending an hour to read up on the symbolism in this book is well worth it as it enriches the story alot and provides a whole new meaning to the book. 5/5 for a great read for all ages."
"Negative","Hate this toy!! AVOID SLIMCANO: Every year I say I am not buying any hotwheels items, even though my son always askes for them. First it was The Fireball, it sucked, then Octoblast, it sucked, last year we got TRex which was slightly better, and then this year the worst- SLIMCANO. This toy falls apart as soon as you touch it,I put the whole thing together and my son starts to play with it and it starts falling apart, the ""slim"" is SOOOOOO messy,it ended up all over my carpet and house. As another reviewer wrote you have to clean this up every time you use it, what a pain!(By the way we did not put it away the last time we played with it, and the slim is all dried up) I love Matchbox products, this year we got The Rocket Park and it is a great toy, sturdy, durable, and hardly any assembly. DO NOT BUY SLIMCANO IT IS REALLY, REALLY WORHTLESS. Save your money"
"Negative","I expected more: My favorite show is The Simpsons. So of course I bought The Simpsons Road Rage. I loved it. So then I bought The Simpsons Skateboarding. I don't like it so much. I love the Simpsons and I love skateboarding but the game is bad. The moves are hard to do and it's a little boring. The cheats codes aren't great and there's limited characters and stuff to do. My advice is buy The Simpsons Road Rage. It's funner and cheaper."
"Negative","This book is horribly written.: The review/essay portion of this book is dry and extraneous. There are a fair amount of example questions, but they are not displayed in a reader friendly format. I quickly decided that I was better off with a couple old Calculus textbooks."
"Negative","Doesn't work very well.....: Purchased two of these switches. Used one to replace the old Handy Switch that used to sell on TV. The Handy Switch worked for 5 years before going bad. I replaced the Handy Switch with the Leviton switch. For starters, the wall switch doesn't ""rock"" on and off like a normal Decora switch, but triggers on and off by pressure. The switch worked well about one day. Now takes several attempts to get the switch to turn on or off. You have to hit the switch just right in order for it to work. It is installed in my pantry. Most of the time I give up and rifle around in the dark or get a flash light. I was very disappointed in this item as I've come to associate Leviton with a quality product. I was sadly surprised to discover that this product does not work very well.I DO NOT recommend this product until they refine the switch, or make the current design work better."
"Negative","If only there was no star: The only reason I am giving this one 1 star is because that is the lowest it goes. Now don't lission to what anyone else has said on here about this cd. It sucks!!!!! THis is one the worst cds I have ever herd by metallica well this and reload and there verson of Misfits. If like real metal then don't get this one. Get old metallica like anything before the black cd. Well S&M was ok the newest cd St. whatever is better then this crap. What where you thinking Metallica and the rest of you people for saying buy this what are you smoking crack or like 10 or somthing. Get over it Metallica is dead musicly. You know who has never changed Slayer and they came out the same time as Metallica and has alwas keep it hard. If you are looking for a old band that still rock pick up anything by slayer. Because Slayer fans would kill metallica fans even one of the members of metallica said this. So leave metallica alone and go with Slayer. Hail SLAYER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Negative","Very disappointing: I bought Dragonfly in Amber and Voyager as soon as I finished Crosstitch. I really enjoyed Crosstitch and was looking forward to continuing the story, but half way through Dragonfly in Amber I have given up, so I won't even bother with Voyager. The saga is soooo boring and predictable! What happened? Clearly Diana Gabaldon has lost the plot (literally), so I won't be buying any more of her books. I am sure some readers will enjoy these, but unfortunately not me."
"Positive","Such beautiful music: I wasn't sure about this show when I saw the piece that was performed at the Tony awards but I bought the CD anyway (without having seen the Broadway show). I love this CD. The music is so rich and lush. It's an incredible work of art."
"Positive","Realistic, great racer: This is definately one to buy. The pricing is very accurate on all the products. The slight downside is the body kit selections. Other then that the game is tight. Get it for Xbox if you have one since online play is awsome. Dont do a pinkslip race too sooon otherwise you might have to start all over. Multiple cars is the key, trust me. Start out with either an Eclipse 99 GS-T or a Golf GTI or a Jetta. They are your best bets. Goodluck."
"Negative","A waste of trees: What a dissapointment - this book is just a collection of the Linux Documentation Project's ""how-to's."" Back that up with a horrible index (a measly 7 page-index covers 2000 pages of text), and these guys get an F for effort. The installation-guide wasn't any help for me because I bought a specific guide for that. What I needed was a comprehensive and well indexed reference."
"Negative","Way too complicated...: This unit is way too complicated, it does everything but the simple functions I needed. If it does what I need, I couldn't figure it out because the instructions are very difficult to understand."
"Positive","Great character voiced by Antonio Banderas: This is a great film for adults and kids alike. It's a re-telling of Jack and the Bean Stalk with a sword expert Kitty ""Puss n' Boots"" and his pal ""Humty Dumpty"". Kitty Southpaws turns out to be Puss n' Boots sweet heart. It's a good chase movie that turns out to have a few life lessons in it. After finding out he was in ""Shrek"", I'm going to have to buy all those movies to see more of this cool cat. I'm not much of fan of this genre. However I was impressed by the quality of the story and the charm of the characters. You don't want to miss this film. It's very light hearted and it will leave you with a smile."
"Negative","Looks nice, but Sound Quality Disappoints: I use several microphones for recording audio training courses. I usually use a USB connection to a laptop or desktop for recording. Two years ago, I bought this one because of it's jack. Unfortunately, the sound quality was too poor to use for even general purpose recording. It seems to be OK for Q&A sessions, but I have a wireless mic that has better sound quality than this wired mic.Every now and then, I'll try the microphone on different equipment, but the sound quality is still too poor. It now sits in a drawer in my office."
"Negative","Geez! I didn't know the human body held that much blood!: ""'A-Team' style action where nobody gets hurt?"" Indeed not! That was true enough of the cartoon series, but how come nobody mentioned the near-death scene of Duke? (A scene which looked like it was going to be an actual death, but somebody changed their mind--look how it's animated and think about it. Duke was supposed to die!) And for gosh sakes, the blood! There was more blood coming out of that stab wound than is humanly possible! I am not kidding here! Those who have seen it know! Another character is stabbed in the eye in a later scene (though without the blood--they used all the plasma on Duke's stabbing, apparently). The ""family oriented"" nature of the film was betrayed by these scenes."
"Negative","not worth it: I enjoyed the special effects, but the plot and acting was horrible. The only reason I finished it was because I paid for the rental."
"Positive","Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean Stainless Bracelet!: I was hesitant ordering this used. Boy was I surprised!The Bracelet shipped in the time stated and the price was great!It looked New, and makes my Planet Ocean look fantastic!Makes a great factory original replacement bracelet for my PO, my old strap is leather and all worn out.Thanks!"
"Positive","andersonville: well worth the price for enthusiasts of the genre. set in andersonville pow camp during the civil war. graphic and gritty, very realistic. done well and advise owning this film."
"Positive","Solid grater with a single flaw: In general we've loved this grater. It's very solidly built with a good assortment of grating sizes. We haven't encountered the rust problem some have noted, though we've washed it both in the dishwasher and by hand, depending on what we've been grating.Other graters we've had in the past have come apart either because of poor welding or weak plastic, but this model has taken everything a cook can throw at it without complaint. The only downside is the rubber no-slip ring on the bottom. We would remove it for washing, but after a few times in the dishwasher, it began to get brittle and broke. It's not a critical flaw for us by any means as most graters we've owned haven't had a ring at all. Still, if you think you want a no-slip bottom, you might want to look at other graters."
"Negative","not their strongest effort...by a longshot: Only 3 songs here, none of which are among their best. Production values are nominal, as you might expect from a BBC session. For the completist only; get the rest of their catalog (Anyway, Fearless, in particular) before you spring for this one."
"Positive","Great Value; Easy To Use: I purchased this scanner for the sole purpose of transferring old slides to a digital format. After more than a hundred scans, I have to say this is a wonderful item. It is easy to use; the software is simple. Though I have no comparison scans, the image resolution exceeds expectations (I scanned them at 1600 x 1200).A professional photographer might prefer a better model, but for home scanning and transferring personal pictures, the Canon 4400F is a great value!My family and I enjoyed seeing full-sized pictures for the first time in decades."
"Positive","I fell in love with this book...: It is the first Vonnegut book I had the pleasure of reading and within a month I have read 4 more. It a fantastic book that manages to mix sci-fi with philosophy and religion. It's a captivating story, and I think one of the best Vonnegut books out there."
"Positive","Delightful: I fell in love with this book many years ago in grade school and was delighted to read it again. It was just as delightful as I remembered"
"Negative","Never Use on Cast Iron Surfaces: At the recommendation of the Staff at Grizzley, I bought Slipit at Springfield Store. It ruined the finish on my cast iron surfaces on a new jointer. Best left to applying Slipit to sticky wooden drawers and not metal parts that will rust. Back to using Trewax or Johnson's Floor Paste Wax. I have used the latter on cast iron surfaces on tools for 20 plus years with no problems using either of these products. Slipit will be slipped into the garbage can."
"Positive","Loved it!: Loved it! Exciting and fun to watch....Love Tim Olyphat's character. Very sexy!It has all the ingredients needed....a man...a gun....a badge...and a whole lot of trouble.Can not wait till next week."
"Negative","Not as labeled - incorrect diameter: Actually ZERO STARS! The label is WRONG! This is NOT 3/16"". It IS 3/32""!!! This is totally useless for applications where I need REAL 3/16"". I cannot understand how a fundamental specification can be so completely incorrect."
"Negative","Horrible: Don't waste your time reading this edition. There are many grammatical errors in this edition. Terrible formatting will not let you get pleasure from reading this book."
"Positive","Geri is so Very!: It's hard to believe, really, that my friend from before the procedure has put out such a marvellous book with such tantalizing quotes. She dishes on so much -- the unprofessional slug that is Lisa ""The Wench"" Whelchel, the philandering Charlotte Rae, and so much more. Gary Coleman, don't go there! LOL, that means laughing out loud! It wasn't always cherries jubilee for Geri, this Katzenjammer Kid of the small screen whose halcyon days radiated with a 1000 points of light. No, no, no; Can you believe JohnSununu actually pulled her off stage at an RNC bennie (that's benefit, to those of you out of showbiz) with her own cane. Pluck! Good thing Rich Bond was there to lay the smackdown on Sunny John Subaru Xanadu chitty chitty bang bang we didn't start the fire!"
"Positive","Simply delicious...: Love this record....Love Chris Isaak.....Love....the band!!I really enjoy the remake of these songs. If anything, I like them more now. Cannot begin to say enough good things about Chris Isaak and his band, truly."
"Negative","WHAT A WASTE OF TIME: I HAVE READ MANY OF JULIE BEARDS' BOOKS AND HAVE REALLY ENJOYED HER WRITING..BUT THIS BOOK WAS NOT UP TO HER USUAL..IT WAS SO SWEET I STARTED TO SUGER OVERDOSE AFTER ABOUT THE FIRST CHAPTER..THE HERO KEPT SAYING THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO BE HONORABLE ANYMORE AND THEN TURNED RIGHT AROUND AND DID EVERYTING HONORABLE..ALSO THE HEROINE WAS A MILK SOP..WHAT A WASTE OF TIME I DIDN'T EVEN FINISH THE BOOK..I WAS SO BORED..I READ ""A DANCE IN HEATHER"" AND LOVED IT SO WHAT HAPPENED JULIE ???? I HOPE THIS JUST WASN'T FOR THE MONEY...ALSO GOOD READ IS ""ROMANCE OF THE ROSE"" OR ""THE MAIDENS HEART"" BUT I WOULD STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE."
"Positive","Halfway Through: Halfway through the book now, I stop and think to myself; How could someone- anyone- write such a wonderful, aweinspiring piece? Luna Lovegood is now one of my favorite characters, and I'm sorry to see the character that dies go. I would recommend this book to readers over the age of 10."
"Negative","Toe strap failed: After about two years of light use, mostly around the house, the toe strap, which is rolled leather, rotted through. This is bad design to not have a reinforcement element inside the strap. Not worth the price."
"Positive","the Bible Code: A very interesting book, the preface is important to understanding the book. Am currently about half way through and enjoying it immensely. J. Dow"
"Negative","Boring: I have read and loved almost all of the alphaget mysteries (with the exception of ""P is for Peril""). This one was excruciatingly boring. I agree with the reviewers who've complained about too much mention of fast food. The book should have been named ""Q is for Quarter Pounder."""
"Positive","A Great Introduction to All Things UFC: Krauss' work is essential reading for UFC fans who are late arrivals to the sport and want to know how it all got started. Many major bouts in the early days of UFC are discussed and also Pride receives a tremendous referencing."
"Positive","Judas Kiss: What a consept, go back in time and meet yourself as a young man...try to relive your experiences and at the same time make them better...This is a well thought out movie, and again great acting. I think this is a great video."
"Negative","Sound is ok if they fit in your ear: I bought them based on the reviews. The problem is that they constantly fall out of one ear. Also there is some minor irritation on one of the ear buds."
"Positive","Nice memories: It was a good compilation of Christmas guests... fun to watch..& to enjoy the memories of times past..& popular guests of the era.. Definitely worth the $$."
"Negative","Poor Quality: Complexity of model should be LV3. Missing the Pilot foot bubble. Sloppy plastic molding. Details is average. For the price is good, but the over all quality is poor."
"Negative","Don't buy this book: I found out I was having twins and ran to the bookstore. Having Twins...was the thickest volume I could find on the topic. Reading it left me depressed, paranoid and angry. As if this experience isn't difficult enough for a working-full-time soon- to-be-mother of three children under the age of THREE!!! Are there any books out there for real mothers? Elizabeth Noble is a crank who eschews medical science for a misplaced nostaglia for the good old days of home birth, home schooling, vegetables fresh from the garden and of course breastfeeding. None of these things are bad but most are largely impractical for working mothers in the 21st century. Thanks for the guilt Ms. Noble."
"Negative","Absolutely Pathetic: This grinder looks good on the counter and has a good cover/lid arrangement.Unfortunately it fails abysmally in its task of grinding coffee. Large chunks of beans still remain when time and heat (a grinding no-no) have reduced some of the coffee to very fine granules.Definitely the worst coffee grinder it has ever been my misfortune to own. Avoid at all cost. A zero star rating would be more appropriate."
"Positive","Practical Guide to New Age Philosophy and Application: This is a simple guide to New Age philosophy with some practical applications to use such as charts, visuliaztions and affirmations."
"Positive","Better than any other mmorpg: World of Warcraft is one of the best i have ever saw,since Burning Crusade is out,here are a few tips for WOW.1.if u play as the undead,good for you,the missions are easy2.your friends will help you,even if being overwhelmed3.don't fight anyone higher than your level4.a party can mostly beat high level monsters5.raids will help overcome most dungeons6.Dwarves are the best for power7.horde players can be attacked if they decide to hurt an alliance player8.the RP server is the best for anyone who wants to try9.hunters are the best for long range,even they have pets10.there are most enemies that have useful items,not one corpse unlooted!i hope these tips are useful,anyway WOW is the best rpg in the world!"
"Negative","Worst POS Ever Made: I bought this movie and wanted to put it in a shredder. Actually you cant even call this horrible product a movie, more like some talentless hacks with a cam corder. This was the worst thing I have ever purchased. There should be a law when idiot's make a so called movie to know what they are doing. Its boring and do not waste your money on this. The exciting part is when some geek steals this so called actresses lip stick and the boys toss it around and dont let her have it, its sad, aweful, really bad. Id rather watch paint dry then see this again, aagghh."
"Positive","Bright Colors, Safe Playground: My bird LOVES the colors of this thing. It is perhaps its best aspect. Easy to keep clean and super safe with no sharp parts."
"Positive","transition: Robot is a regenereation story. Tom Baker is the iconic Doctor, arguely the best and most well known Doctor. Added to this is the presence of the late Elizabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane and Nicholas Courtney as Brigadier Leftwich-Stewart, the Doctor eases into what is probably the most well written and executed era in the series. Gone are the gadjets and James Bond like persona of the Third Doctor played by the late Jon Pertwee, Baker's Doctor is playful at times and very tough at others. Baker would go on to play the Doctor for seven years, twice as long as any of the previous actors in the role and those since he left the part. In a sense, the series declined ever so gradually after Baker's departure from the role until its end in the late 1980's Robot is a fun story in the King Kong mode and when it ends, the Doctor, Sarah Jane and Harry are off on further adventures in time and space. I was very pleased with the speed that Amazon got this product to me"
"Negative","Not very useful information: The book assume and reader have a certain level of knowledge branding. It does not tell you how and why rather state only the what. The examples and case studies in this book is really pathetic. I feel that half of the book is certainly advertisement for the author's company. In conclusion, this book is definitely not worth reading if you do not have much time to spare.If you are serious about branding look somewhere else."
"Negative","The Girl Next Door: When I was first told of Charlotte Church, I was told she would remind me of the girl next door. After listening to Enchantment, I can now express a concuring opinion. Unfortunately, as with the girl next door,that opinion is somewhat less than flattering. The songs were nice as were the instrumentals and background vocals. However, Charlotte sounded out of place on this album. She simply doesn't have the overall vocal quality or professional ability to control her voice in a manner which the songs on the album require. As a matter of fact, I am seriously considering contacting her and trying to set up a duet with the girl next door to me. After all, birds of a feather should flock together. If this were Charlotte's first album, I might suggest trying it so as to see what the new kid on the block sounds like. However as a 4th album, this will not tell anyone anything. Other reviewers indicate her best stuff is behind her so that is where anyone interested should look."
"Negative","Poorly researched and mostly false: Where to begin. There are so many mistakes and factual errors that it really shows that ANYONE can publish a history book. This book is akin to William Styron's ""Confessions of Nat Turner"" which is a white liberal's distortion of black rebellion during slavery. Hoyt acts as if Paul Robeson could not think for himself or that he was ""duped by the USSR"" and that he was politically naive. That it is a bold faced lie. No matter how you feel about his views , Robeson made his own political choices and was his own man. Intellectuals like Shaw, H.G. Wells and masterminds like Einstein respected Paul Robeson for his intellect. Robeson was a Phi Beta Kappa laureate, and an attorney who spoke over 12 languages. Martin Duberman's biography is far superior to this joke of a ""biography."""
"Negative","A little disappointed: I love Kliban Cat but was a bit disappointed in this particular book. Didn't have but a few of my favorite Kliban pictures"
"Negative","4 images: You will not see any musician playing any instrument. You will see only images, colour, like those of window media player, something so bored. If you like the sound, buy a cd with the complete work, but this dvd is not that you want."
"Negative","Great design but mixed results.: It's a bit hard to rate this product...on the positive side, I give it a 5 for design. It's so easy to use and is way better than the old style mousetraps. You can set this with one hand and no fear of getting snapped, and you can remove the mouse from it without having to touch the mouse. Really nice.On the negative side, it doesn't always trip. I am frequently finding that the peanut butter is gone and the trap has not tripped. There's no way to adjust the sensitivity, so I don't know what to do. I fear I'm just making my mice fat.I wrote the company a while ago and, to their credit, they responded. They told me to not put too much peanut butter in the trap. I've done that, but I often find the traps untripped.So: Really super design, and when it works it is great, but it doesn't always work.Given the fact that reliability is an important part of any product, I'm giving this a 2."
"Positive","Sharp and reliable history: This is one of the most readable general histories of the Israeli-Arab conflict I've encountered. Benny Morris's _Righteous Victims_ suffers in comparison. Although Shlaim is considered a ""revisionist"" historian (meaning he uses primary sources regarding the formation of the state of Israel instead of cultivated propaganda), this book is still definitely written from an Israeli perspective. He sees immense differences between Labor and Likud's philosophies, whereas from a Palestinian perspective, they've lot just as much land and been treated with just as much contempt under Labor as they have under Likud. On the other hand, having lived and worked in the West Bank city of Hebron during the Rabin/Peres/Netanyahu years, I have to say his coverage of that period of time rings true for me."
"Negative","Galway's tone color too bright for Khachaturian!: I was looking for a replacement of my recording of Jean-Pierre Rampal's rendition of the Flute Concerto, and decided to give Galway's version a spin. Khachaturian's Concerto is a smoldering melodic journey through the steppes of central Asia, using the flute's sonorous lower register to an unusual degree. Unfortunately, Galway's very first entrance was 8va!!! Galway's tone color is too bright throughout the performance, making this interpretation completely off the mark.The Royal Philharmonic does an adequate job, better than the ORTF who accompanied Rampal."
"Negative","Avoid this product: This thermostat has several problems which make me regret choosing it. I initially chose it because of a reccomendation from CR. I will buy a different brand next time."
"Positive","Best book ever: I loved this book soooooooo much p.s. I will read it again!!!!!!!!!!!and again and again and again and again p.s. love you"
"Positive","Wonderfully kickass: This CD is incredible! It makes up for all of Nirvana's softer stuff combined! All of Grohl's songs (with the slight exeption of ""For all the Cows"") makes an wonderful blend of music ranging from hardcore rock to moderate pop, a kickass drummer, and brilliant(if nonsensical) lyrics. I mean, it sucks that Kurt Cobain went and commited suicide, but the music IS good...Anyway, if you like alternative or the Foos themselves, and don't already have this CD, then for heaven's sakes BUY IT!"
"Positive","Had to get it: What can I say - I'm a Battlestar Galactica Fan - I just HAD to get this for My BSG Library."
"Positive","Old-school greatness...: I say ""old school"" but I remember well the days when this talc wasn't necessarily ""old school""...it just ""was."" The bottom line, this is the finest talc I've ever used and I've been using this talc for many, many years. Longer than I care to admit anyway. Feels great, works perfectly and smells outstanding. It is the talc of choice of most barbers for a reason.FYI, you can likely pic it up at your local drugstore for cheaper than it's being offered here (at this time anyway), but, that said, as long as it is somewhere in the neighborhood of $6 to $7, it's not an altogether bad deal.Highly recommended."
"Positive","Fascinating: So many years have passed and we finally know the name of one of the assassins. A great two disc DVD set."
"Positive","Popular music at its best: A very nice compilation of two albums by Rosemary Clooney. The first album ""Rosie with the Hi-Lo's"" is very well done and incorporates the Hi-Los in an effective supporting role for Rosemary. It is a different showcase for her considerable vocal talents, and like Scotch, took a few moments before I could appreciate it. But it is good musically.The second album ""Hollywood's Best with Harry James"" is simply beautiful. Rosie and Harry recorded these selections between 1947 and 1953 and the recordings have the solid Columbia sound and musicality and are of high fidelity. The stand out recordings for this reviewer are ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" and ""When you wish upon a Star,"" with the latter known to be so pretty as to induce tears while listening in some adult men. I played this album for a Big Band lover at the nursing home where I work and he said ""If God made anything more beautiful than that, he kept it to himself."""
"Negative","Not pwerfull enough shorted quickly: I was desperate to get this item as my dog gets excited about chasing squirells, cats, dogs, mice, roaches, yah just about anything out here in the country. I put it on level 5 so that she would lear quickly as it is very dangerous for small dogs out here. It Didn't stop my sweet Lhaso Apso (who by the way is like my child as I can't have any) from getting through boundry on level 5 and yes I made sure it was on, touching her skin,new battery, and no metal or anything was blocking the radio signal. So after that I put it on 6, but then about a week later the wire shorted out, ( I didn't move it around even though it claims to be portable) but it was past the return date. The in ground one was much better, but I didn't bring it on the move to the Florida panhandle from Albuquerque, Nm."
"Positive","Tom Selleck Fan - Jesse Stone Series: I enjoy every aspect of the Jesse Stone series. I have all six and would recommend this series to anyone that enjoys the style of Tom Selleck's acting skills."
"Positive","Great buy - great value: Bought these pennants for a pirate party - they went a long way to help me decorate a large space. The connecting part was sturdy and easy to tie off and/or tape. Highly recommend."
"Negative","Bland, razor thin scripts, epitomizes the worst of fifties tv: After enjoying the still fresh, witty, and tender-hearted Leave it to Beaver series on DVD, I was ready for another fifties family sit-com. I bought this show as it always got better ratings than LITB. What a disappointment! The scripts are razor thin, the humor is non-existent, the whole series reeks of the kind of blandness that fifties sit-coms are mocked for. Poorly written by hacks, this one is moldy and has aged very poorly. Carl Betz is handsome but wooden. Donna Reed is pretty but totally unconvincing. The kids are self-consciously annoying actors with Paul Petersen's character hinting at the aggravatingly precocious child actors to come later on in TV land. Skip this one."
"Negative","Poor reproduction of a Wonderful Album: Do not buy.: I own the original Kind of Blue Album. This CD reproduction bites the big one. I got Borders bookstore to give me a full refund-A rarity. The original album is a classic."
"Positive","good stuff: I used this product in making brown sugar body scrub and it works beautifully on dry skin especially in combination with other body oils."
"Negative","Can't use this to learn german: I could not learn German from this software, I had too much trouble with it, was not working well on my computer platform. Made my windows pc crash to much."
"Negative","THIS IS NOT DRY KILL LOGIC: This is not dry kill logic's older band. I have purchased this cd and I made a mistake. All the reviews on here say its dry kill logic BUT IT IS NOT."
"Negative","Beginners Gun: This gun was okay when I first started using it. It's really a backyard gun, and should only be used for beginners. I had it on my bed, which is about two feet high, and it fell when my dog jumped on, the barrel broke. The spring in the magazine also broke. There are better guns out there, but if you just want to have some good clean fun in your backyard, this is the gun for you. The sight is a pretty nice feature."
"Negative","Non-dairy = funky taste!: I've been drinking these Sweet Success shakes every morning for a while. The Sweet Success Vitatein shakes in vanilla and chocolate are both great and I wish I could say the same for this product because I'd hoped the non-dairy shake would be just as good, but truthfully, this shake has a semi-bitter and unnaturally odd aftertaste. My husband and I both tried to choke these down, but wound up getting rid of close to half a case because we were both dreading drinking them every morning.If you can tolerate dairy, stick with the regular Vitatein shakes."
"Negative","Outdated and tired: I'm not sure what some of these readers are smoking but this book has to be about 10-15 years out of date. In it's day I'm sure it was well worth the money but time to upgrade!"
"Negative","BORING: I did not like this story because it was pretty dull. It did not have the best details and it had no pictures. You should be able to see what the events are like. For a scary story this very very pedestrian. I don't think that a bird would scare me. If it was a lot of evil birds it would be different. So I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody."
"Positive","comfortable: I injured my arm playing golf. I have worn this armband for about four weeks straight. Initially, I didn't think it did any good, but I kept with it. Now I am finally seeing some progress. The elbow does not hurt as much as before, though I can definitely tell a difference when I take off the arm band. My only complaint is that the tan color gets dirty and it will not clean. I wish the material was consistent on both sides. One side in a nice felt-like material that looks nicely made. The back side is a foam material that looks out of place. Unfortunately, when you tighten the arm band, the foam is what shows on the tightened side due to its design.I am impressed that my arm is feeling better, but don't like walking around with a dirty armband, especially at work, so I purchased another unit, this one black in color. I am hoping the black one hides dirt better. The original unit is still being used for yard work, etc and still functions fine."
"Positive","Buy it! Now!!: If you like Fluke and The Prodigy, The Propellerheads and The chemical brothers: Go ahead! Buy this CD, you won't be deceived. It's the best of electronic music I've ever heard. You'll love it."
"Positive","A Slap in the Face from Reality: This book was exactly what I thought it would be, not that I was disappointed. As women, we may not want to believe that a relationship didn't work out simply because 'he's just not into me'. Reading this book and seeing it from a different perspective made me realize how oh so wrong I was when it came to men. Period! I'm screaming at the book because some of these women are so stupid and blind! But then I stop and realize, ""oh wait...that was me once"". I would absolutely recommend this book to any of my girlfriends. It's comical, frank and exactly what I needed to hear! Like I said, a slap of reality in the face!"
"Negative","Mediocre: I bought this package at the Cingular store. I've never used a Bluetooth accessory before now. I don't particularly like it because the part that sets inside your ear is too far up on the headset itself and I can't put the earhook over my ear and have the actual earpiece in my ear at the same time. It;'s very uncomfortable to me but I got the headset, charger and car charger in a box set all for under $100. Not too bad, but the audio quality isn't that great either. I will keep looking to see if I can find a headset that doesn't require the earhook to stay in place."
"Negative","OK, but there are better: This was an OK book. I know some love Papazian but it's a little dated and written in a somewhat monotonous style. Some of the techniques are less than desirable, (i.e. pouring hot wort through a plastic filter into cold water sitting in a carboy. Also, I could have done without the projected need to calm new brewers by saying ""relax, have a home-brew!' on ever single page. It is demeaning to those of us who are professionals in other fields. I would recommend just about anything written by Dave Miller, specifically his ""Homebrewing Guide"". Skip Papazian, there are far better books out there these days. BTW, the my first brew was an all grain oat stout that turned out quite well. Skipping the shortcut methods using DME and extract syrups was my first best decision in brewing. Running an all grain mash adds very little time, is very easy in my opinion and creates a much richer, delicious beer."
"Positive","Wonderful TV: This has been a great TV. Very clear picture. The white glove setup was a real plus. Especially like that only a card is needed for HD rather than a settop box."
"Positive","Really nice skirt: I was pleasantly surprised when I received this skirt. It was much better styled than the picture indicated. A really super skirt."
"Negative","Absolute WORST instant yeast I have EVER used.: I have tried nearly a dozen times to make rolls, bread, etc., with this yeast. I have adjusted method and recipe, STILL, the end result is VERY DISAPPOINTING.Tossed 3 loaves of bread yesterday - one pan of rolls today.Cannot afford the loss!"
"Positive","Rizzoli calls it ""Woo woo""...: Our favorite blunder-butt cop Rizzoli and humorless pathologist Isles are back! The Mephisto Club is a group of individuals worldwide that believe that many of the evil acts in the world are committed by the offspring of fallen angels. Rizzoli and Isles are skeptical, but when people seem to be dying around their group, it raises some questions. The back story surrounds the Saul family, whom except for the daughter Lily and stray cousin Dominic all died mysteriously twelve years ago. Now Lily is on the run and no one can find Dominic.Gerritsen writes in her usually creepy I-think-I'll-sleep-with-the-lights-on-tonight fashion, just teetering on hokey. Her obvious extensive research is evident in the detail of the book and that helps to make it believable and scary. There is also a juice side story involving Isles and the hunky but unavailable priest Daniel Brophy. You won't be disappointed!"
"Negative","everything deflated on it's own in hours: I bought this pool two times. My toddler loved it but both times I had to return it because everything deflated on it's own in some hours."
"Positive","love it!!!: love having her so close!!!!!! allows for good interaction & easy reach for breast feeding"
"Positive","GREAT Album!: PFR fans will NOT be disappointed! In many ways, this is PFR's fifth album--as lyrically creative and as wonderfully hook-filled as the mighty PFR's output. And certainly there is nothing ""boring"" about it: with two fine lead singers, soft and hard numbers, glorious melodies, and superb musicianship, it really is a terrific collection of tunes. But it now!"
"Negative","Too much bandwith/channel interference in my area.: That's probably why this set was $5. If you live in an area where there are lots of stations, as I do, you won't be able to find a frequency this will transmit on cleanly. Plus, you really have to crank your volume up on your Zune and your radio. I recommend buying another car with the mp3 player built into the radio - ha!"
"Negative","Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this kind of ""comedy"": I watched about 30 minutes of this,(recorded from TV) and then boredom set in. Bad acting and weak attempts at humor finally made me skim through it - something I very seldom do. I finally just erased it and went to bed. I envy the people who find this hilarious - they must enjoy life a lot more than I do. (Just kidding, of course.) For a more sophisticated review of this so-called hilarious movie, check the Rotten Tomatoes review. The film gets half of a star from that reviewer."
"Positive","Brilliant!!!: As I live in Canada, you may see why I'm in love with Jack Johnson and his music for many reasons. The first being that his music just rocks my invisible socks--silly but true-- and once again who wouldn't rather be in Hawaii like Jack than in Canada like me??Back to the music...This album is sweet, you should definitely buy it as soon as you can. Just get your hands on this exquisite music any way possible, and put it on your pod, although i don't recommend stealing it. heheh."
"Negative","Boring but with great performances: When I saw a short clip of Ellen Burstyn's performance while she was in the run for the Academy Awards I said to myself I had to have that movie, and after hearing how many versions there were and how to find the ""original"" one I kinda laugh at myself now.I expected yes a totally screwed-up movie about drugs etc, but I didn't expect it to be so boring. I was ready to take the disc out several times but then decided something good had to happen.I didn't understand several things, also Jennifer Connelly's characte was very unsympathetic. Even though Ellen Burstyn must have nightmares thinking of her own brilliant performance, I don't think I will even watch this movie again. It was really hard to get through, not because of the subject, but because it was boring. And the refrigerator scenes were the most dull.At least I think that if I didn't already have any wish to ever do any kind of drug, I certainly would not have it after seeing this movie. But that's just me."
"Negative","DORKA DARKA DARKA THE EXPLORER: GOOD JOB DORA. AT LEAST YOUR BETTER THAN GIRL AUTHORITY OR AS I CALL THEM THE GIRL LOSERS. THOSE GIRLS SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!! aLL OF THE COOL PEEPS THINK YOUR WAY BETTE THAN GIRL AUTHORITY! IN THE NAME OF GIRLHOOD YOU ROCK, dorka!!!!!"
"Negative","9521A: My 9521A loses 9 degrees in just 180 degrees of rotation.... But thats not the main issue with this style of rotor... If you buy one of these rotors from any of the companies the absolute FIRST thing you do is take off the little black weather boot and completely fill the groove up with a good silicone sealer.... reinstal and run another 1/4 inch bead around top of boot to completely seal it. My experiance with this was learned the hard way... If you do not do this you can rest assured that after 2 hard rains and 30 days the little cheap bearing and gears in these units will rust solid and all your efforts will have been for naught!!!!"
"Positive","So cute: I ordered this puzzle to use at school with my Special Needs students. They all love it and I love that I can use the net in a few different ways. Great product."
"Positive","Dependable power: I have bought aftermarket chargers that fall apart after a few months. Not so the iGo. This is a fine little product, it does the job quietly and well. I find the interchangeable tips to be a great idea. When I change phones, it's only a few bucks to get a new tip. This charger is sturdy and looks like I'll get a couple of years out of it."
"Positive","Love it: We love the clever creators of this book. It's magic. My little boy loves it when we combine singing with reading... We started with ""The Wheels on the Bus"" by the same author, which has been a hit ever since he was tiny (keep the moving parts away from those grabby fingers!). We thought we'd try this one, and he loves it just as much. Plus, it's entertaining for the adult who reads it as well.I just recommend that you keep it up high and put it back up immediately after reading. I've had to make a few repairs after leaving it out; it's too irresistible for any child to try to move the tabs on their own."
"Positive","good movie: Yo, the last reviewer was way off, so just erase those thoughts from your memory. This documentary is raw and refined at the same time. There are interviews with artists such as Snoop Dog, Masta Killa, Sunz of Man, Jadakiss,Sticky Fingaz, etc. The guy making the flick is puffing ""L""s the whole time with the rappers, and just having casual conversation. I thought it was a sick soundtrack with intimate interviews that are informative at least, and incredibly entertaining regardless. Worth checking out, and definitely worth 10 bucks. There aren't enough hip-hop documentaries and this one will be a classic."
"Positive","Great Product: I was very please with my order. The shipment came quickly and it was exactly what I was looking for :)"
"Positive","If you liked 'em acoustic: Wait 'til you hear Tesla REPLUGGED! Touted as the live album with tracks chosen by the fans, this new double live is worth every penny. Many different shows come together to recreate a true Tesla concert experience. You'll be able to rock to such standby's as Modern Day Cowboy and Edison's Medicine...and then thrill to some ""obscure"" tunes such as We're No Good Together, Call It What You Want and Freedom Slaves. If you saw Tesla on their 6 month Replugged tour, you need to get this CD set. If you haven't seen them yet, you need to get this CD set...and then see them when they pass thru your town this fall/winter!"
"Negative","Worst movie I've ever seen: The movie one hour photo seemed an interesting film to me so i rent it, but then wow! What is that?Its one of the worst movies i have seen this year, the plot goes on and on so slow and eventually when you finish watching the movie you simply ask yourself: WHY? Does it really worth 90 minutes of your life?Well i did not seem to think so; Williams gave a nice performance but nothing more.Honestly, i expected much better."
"Negative","Good Quality But Unnecessary: These are fine tapes, but there is no need to spend so much money on them.By design, DV and HDV tapes are identical.The only difference is the price."
"Negative","I'm still waiting: I am very upset because I still have not received the movie. It has never taken so long to receive any of the product that I have ordered on-line."
"Positive","A must have for LOTR fans and collectors: I am a huge lifetime fan of this genre. Tolkien was a tremendously gifted author and the LOTR series of books has had a huge impact worldwide from the time it was first released. I was excited when I heard that the series was going to be made into a movie. However, as happens so often when trying to take a story of this magnitude and put it on the silver screen, I was afraid that the movie would fall short of the expectation. I'm happy to say the movie exceeded the expectation. And while some would say the original was too long, all I could say was give me more. The extended versions fulfill that request. And, while I was disappointed that the movie did not include the return to the Shire at the end, it is still one of the greatest movies of all time. As stated previously, if you are a fan of LOTR, the extended additions are a must-buy."
"Negative","More Psychobable: I did not like this book at all, and I have read more self-help books than I can count. Although I agree that enless examination of the past is not all that useful I also have a hard time believing that 10 events in your life have defined who you are. I rapidly became tired of the so-called ""in your face"" style, and found his approach to be just as couched in ""psychobable"" as any other book of this type I have read. I think his approach is overated and this volume has convinced me to give up this type of self-help book forever! Get out there, live your life outloud, and stop waiting for someone like Phil McGraw to make your life what you want it to be."
"Negative","Looks Great, if it plays!: My first review for a product on Amazon.I would have given this set 5 stars, if it played. I had read of the problems on this set. Then Amazon stopped selling it, put it up for review. Then they started to sell it again, and on sale for under $58. Took the leap of faith, and bought it!As soon as the set arrived, I went right to one of the episodes I read was ""problematic"", The Big Tall Wish on disc 4. Sure enough, the episode freezes at 12:30, and will not stat playing again. I skipped to the next episode and the disc would freeze, and skip.Image needs to address this, and I hope Amazon stops selling it (for good) until this problem is resolved.I am playing this on a Sony BDP1000ES, a great player, that has played everything, up to this point. I have the latest firmware too. Hope this gets fixed, cause I would love to own it, and give it 5 stars!"
"Negative","D-link Air+ router: I purchased this product because of it's advertised high transfer rate and the fact that it was a Wireless access point and router combined which would save space.When I went to install the configuration interface on my laptop it did not install completely. When I attempted to delete and reinstall it said the product was already installed. When I attempted to install again it said that the software had already been installed. Within 5 minutes I was not able to use my laptop. To correct this I had to reformat my hard drive and re-install Windows 2000 Pro on my Dell Latitude C-600.I then attempted to load the user interface on my HP PIII desktop and the Web Browser interface/configuration tool would not communicate with the Air+ router.I ended up returning the product and stuck with my old router.As a business owner who uses these products on jobs, I can't afford to install finicky products such as the Air+ router."
"Negative","What a pointless boring movie!: Where do I start - horrible script, boring acting, moronic ending. 1 star was the lowest I could give it. How Colin Firth has fallen from the P&P days."
"Positive","overlooked Cagney gem: City for Conquest is an early Cagney film that should be brought out on dvd. It summons up the dynamic action of Cagney and mixes it with the pathos of a story of artistic endevor, brotherhood, and a dual quest. All of this is surrounded by a haunting musical score and a background being the greatest city in the world. A must see for Cagney or NYC fans."
"Positive","Hope - New Testament: This is a nice little handy version of the New Testament. I refer to it all the time and it's much easier to carry around with me than the larger, complete bible. I would recommend this to anyone who prefers the New King James version of the bible."
"Positive","Brilliant dialogue outshines cheesy special effects.: I've been waiting for this show on DVD since my first DVD player. The writing is superb, the tone is dark--as fond as I am of Star Trek, Blake's 7 makes Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise look like Barney and Friends."
"Negative","Dissapointed: The ring did not fit.Ordered a size 6 but got a size 9. Eventhough they resent the item even that was the sameThough I had planned to order many more items am not confident now"
"Negative","DANCER MAKER REVEIW: I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY CHILDREN AGES 10 AND 11. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE THE ARCADE GAME THAT YOU DANCE TO THE BEAT. I WAS SO WRONG THE KIDS TRIED IT A COUPLE OF TIME. THEY SAID IT WAS NO FUN IT WAS IN THE GARAGE SELL THAT SUMMER"
"Positive","Excellent performances, recording-remastering mediocre...: These recordings date from 1962 through 1964. The state-of-the art for analog was fully developed by then (see the fine RCA Living Stereo releases from the 1950's!), so my best guess as to the ""metallic"" sound of the piano is that it stems from a bad remaster/transfer job in 1991-2 and/or the use of 2nd or later generation tapes, or a bad recording to begin with... Truth be told, I have the original LPs that came as a boxed set containing all of LvB's piano music (incl. the concertos,etc.) and I am leaning toward the last possibility being the case here... the performances trump the sonics, and I'd not hesitate to recommend these versions."
"Positive","Good economical lens: I bought this lens to do a wedding (non-professionally) while I was still waiting for my 18-200VR from that ""N"" camera company. I was pleasantly surprised at the photographic quality of this Sigma lens. I got great shots and the 300 length was really nice to let me keep my distance but get some tight shots. 28 in digital (42 in 35mm terms) is not wide enough, so I had to switch out to my 18-55mm a couple of times. (I think I need to get down to about 10 or 12mm to be wide enough at times).Drawbacks: The lens is a little heavy, and at first, it was also a little difficult to zoom. After a while, it loosened up and became easier to operate.Summary: A good lens at a good price but I wish it was an 18-300 instead of 28-300."
"Positive","Surprised that it didn't help my sprinklers: I bought this to replace a standard 4-way adapter that used narrower outlets, thinking that the larger outlets on this model would extend the range of my lawn sprinklers. I was surprised to find that, if anything, the range of my sprinklers decreased slightly with this model. It otherwise works well. I'd be interested to hear others' experience with this full-flow model vs the standard-flow models."
"Negative","IT SUCKED!!: I really hated it...Van Morrison really gaked out Comfortably Numb, ..what WAS Roger Waters thinking when he 'cast' this? The Scorpions and Bryan Adams weren't bad, but all in all... a thumbs down. Floyd was at their best when they were all together. No doubt about that."
"Positive","Super Buy: My 2 year old and I have been enjoying Laurie Berkner's videos on Noggin so much, that I chose this CD to buy. Although we'd heard only one of the tracks that are on this album, I thought that the rest of her songs would be a sure bet. I was right! Talk about toe-tapping, fun-songs-in-your-head type of music. I don't think there's one song we don't enjoy together, and all lyrics are included, too, so we can learn to sing along. This is one CD we'll be listening to for a long while."
"Positive","great music/poor mastering: The music on this cd is wonderful- I bought it because I have it on vinyl. Joanne Brackeen's piano is poorly mastered on this cd. If you can risk this cd disappearing from the market without a remastered version taking it's place, wait for a remastered version."
"Negative","The Worst Author - Ever: Save your money. Never, never waste your funds on the drivel this author produces!!A profitable trader would never have time enough to write even one tenth the quantity of words this person produces.Find traders that actually make money to learn from. There are a few that have written good books.As starting points:For equities traders try: Professional Stock TradingFor futures traders try: Trading Day by DayThese are simply starting points, but are written by REAL traders, not worthless-book producers."
"Negative","Don't do it!: The Krause ladder I thought was the best I ever used. I had it for 5 years with trouble free use. It got me everywhere I needed to get to. I Maintained it better than what the manufactures specs. Then it failed me. I was up on it for about 10 mins. then I repositioned it to get closer to my work with out touching any of the mechanisms. All of the sudden one of the sections decided to open and throw me thru a large window and break my foot. Needless to say I am now a proud owner of a little giant ladder. Everyone I work with had one and I said no mine was fine until it failed me. They had their ladders for 15 years without incident. So really research, talk around with others before buying this particular product."
"Positive","Good, but skip the pages of environmentalist drivel: This was a well written, well researched book, except for the few pages that diverged into the global warming debate.The history presented was well done. I would recommend this to those interested in the history of technology."
"Negative","Interesting, i think not!!!: This book started out ok, then as it went on i started to become more bored. I read it because i had to do a book report. Andrew clemets has lots of other good books but this is not one of his best!!"
"Negative","Disappointed: I purchased this product in order to shave my dog for the summer. However, it barely took any fur off with each stroke. It finally got to the point where repeating the same area began to become annoying to the dog, so I took him into Petco instead. Unfortunately, this product didn't work as I had hoped."
"Negative","SHEEP SKIN SEAT COVER: In paying 8o+ dollars I assumed they would be sheep skin however only the center stip was, the outer was synthetic and came off all over my clothes every time I sat on them, also the color was suppose to be Champagne (pale yellow) and it ended up being ""bright"" yellow. I was however very please with the ease of returning and getting a refund on this item."
"Negative","Red Dragon for 8-year-olds: A Stranger is Watching is an amazingly childish book. It is written at the a level somewhere between Ayn Rand and the Hardy Boys (um, the Hardy Boys of course being more sophisticated than Rand). It is every cliché you could imagine rolled into one. It really should be classified a children's book--it has no sex, almost no violence, no psychology, no ""adult content"" or language. The characters are cardboard. It is a Lifetime movie, except without the depth.It gets two stars because I can't say you won't be entertained, again, in the way a Hardy Boys book is entertaining.Here is the best line in the book, just to give you a taste:""The woman fell on her side, tried to speak, 'Knife . . . still in my back . . . help . . . please . . . take it out . . . hurts . . . want to die here . . .'""I'm not joking, that line is in the book!"
"Positive","Works very well for us!: We have had this for 6 months and have found that it works very well. I think some of the other reviewers were exaggerating a bit on their reviews. It doesn't ""choke"" when making fruit smoothies, nor does it have a problem handling ice. Actually it's the most powerful for the price I think.Of course I have to admit that it is a bit time consuming to clean, but most blenders I have seen will have this issue.The gasket has never caused us problems. Maybe we were using it correctly...? :)I am happy with this product. Looking forward to many years of no-problem use."
"Negative","Nice Features But Unreliable: I have purchased two of these Hamilton Beach coffee grinders this year and both have failed. On both, the core of the unit (motor & blade) has slowly separated from the casing so that the lid no longer operates the safety interlock switch, rendering the unit inoperable. This is poor engineering design. I now use a $20 Krups unit; it does not have the built-in timer but it works. Viva los Germans!"
"Negative","Does It Ever Stop?: Yet another printing of timeless old war horses of American serious music! This is just another way for Sony to make a few bucks off of stuff they've had laying around for decades. (""Nothing new here, folks. Move along."")Is the music good? Of course! Along with ""Rhapsody in Blue"" these selections are the most purchased pieces of American music in the category.Should you have this recording? Well, look at it this way: If you'd like to have a Xeroxed copy of the New York Times for December 7th, 1941, I suppose you couldn't get hurt....except that it's a copy...and copies always are lacking in integrity. This CD is no different. The sound is, to me, lacking.I wouldn't buy it. Why? Well, I've had these pieces in my library for 25 years."
"Negative","Warning: Elitist Alert: This book has some history, a few dates and numbers, and lots of stories.Unfortunately, you'll be cruising along, reading the stories and enjoying yourself, and bap!, you're sucker-punched with some negative comment or exposure.If you like to hear bad things about people who have accomplished greatness, or little insults toward styles that aren't cool enough, this is the book for you."
"Positive","Mike and Jason will CHANGE your LIFE!: Coversations With Millionaires is the missing link toleading the life of your dreams. Here's what I learntthat may be helpful to you:1) Only a fool learns from his own mistakes. Learnfrom other people's mistakes.2) The amount you get, is directly proportionate tothe amount you serve.3) You cannot hope to become rich by getting a degree.Success is a DEDICATED field of study.Conversations With Millionaires is THE textbook to achievingsuccess. This will go alongside ""Think and Grow Rich"" as themonumental blueprint for achieving financial prosperity.My highest recommnedation!"
"Positive","Amazing Pop/Rock Album: Avril Lavigne was just 17-years-old when she recorded this album, and even so, she didn't allow record execs to turn her into a blonde pop princess like most of the other female artists out there. Every track, from LOSING GRIP to NAKED feature feelings that everyone (especially teenagers) experience at least once in their lives. Featuring catchy lyrics, which are wise beyong Avril's years, and even catchier beats, LET GO is sure to become a classic with the MTV generation, as well as an anthem for teenagers across the world. Fans of pop, or rock, will find themselves rocking out to every track, as this album offers a little bit of something for everyone. Don't miss it.Erika Sorocco"
"Negative","Something Loose Inside !: I received the breadmaker, and when I was taking it out of the box, I noticed something rattling inside the bread maker. I noticed that there was a Chinese ""QC Passed"" sticker on the bottom of the machine. Great job guys.I tried to take the bottom off the breadmaker, but it won't come off. I guess that I will have to leave the loose screw or whatever it is , inside until it shorts out the electrical components. It's not worth the $15.00 shipping to return it for a new one. I was hoping for a little better quality for a $60.00 BREAD MACHINE !"
"Negative","the author is biased: IB interferes with excellence in our schools by undercutting AP which does a better job. And IB adds no value to what we already have.IB is a needless european concept that competes for resources to undercut what we already had in place and is not as rigorous.This book is pretty much the long form of his columns in the washington post and is just as unconvincing.If you like IB then read the book. Jay will preach to the IB choir.You will be very happy.If you want a rigorous and unbiased assessment of our educational alternatives then don't bother as this is imho merely IB propaganda.If you already know that IB is not beneficial then definitely skip this book."
"Negative","Comments on Song of Nevada: Visual quality of this video is fair to average. The sound track is good. This is a 54 minute cut version of this title. The original theatrical release had a running time of approximately 75 minutes. Uncut versions of this film can be found in private film collections, but none are known to be available on home video. This 1944 release is one of the first 3 films Roy starred in with Dale Evans. It is too bad that this title is not available on video in its original full length form, as this is one of the better Roy Rogers films."
"Positive","Baumann at his best: If you like horn music this is for you. Some pieces are for multiple horns including Herr Baumann. Various composers, some not known for horn compositions."
"Positive","A Decent Dog Toy: My dog can rip through most stuffed toys in a day or two. I have been using this ultimate boomerang with him for about a month and while he has ripped off some of the stitching, it's condition isn't that bad yet. And my dog does seem to enjoy fetching and catching the boomerang. I have no illusion that this dog toy will last forever. If the dog toy companies made toys that lasted forever they would go out of business. But it is a notch tougher than most of the dog toys out there and my dog seems to have a good time with it. The price here on Amazon is less than what I paid for it in the pet store so if you want a dog toy with slightly better than avaerage durability it might be worth buying it here."
"Negative","Great Looks, Poor Build quality: I was originally excited to get the Dulit mixer, however just 3 years on it is broken. The plastic drive gears to the mixer failed prematurely and there is no way to have it repaired. It would be hard to say how many times I used it, but it is fair to say many time less than 100 as we hardly bake anything or need a mixer.I am going to get a different brand this time around."
"Negative","Not the case pictured: I bought this case in fall 2003. When I lost it, I ordered another. The version they sent has a metal snap that always pops loose instead of the wide velcro strip. The case they sent has a plastic and metal snap hook that I had to cut off when I got it.Not what I ordered Adorama!"
"Positive","Schwartz explores a universe of sounds: This CD presents 5 works that reside in the edge of the known musical universe, where Ives, Stockhausen, Crumb and Varese have gone before. This is not to demean the originality of Schwartz's style; in the colliding collage of musics that form ""Voyager,"" in the cheerfully spooky antics of ""Jack O'Lantern,"" and the other works on this album, Schwartz charts a musical constellation completely his own. (And he had no idea that a Star Trek TV series was called ""Voyager"" when he named the piece, which is his impression of certain places he has visited...)"
"Negative","OVERPRICED PIECE OF PLASTIC JUNK. DOESN'T WORK AND IS UNSAFE.: Upon reading other reviews I placed order for this unit. When it arrived I was dismayed at what you get for this money. Upon using I became more dismayed as the unit is almost impossible to use. The food drags on the slide. Using the holder helps move the food but it only cuts about half way down and then you are left with the other half to cut by hand with a knife and cutting board. Kind of defeats the purpose. Plastic is flimsy and distorts when food is pushed through causing irregular cuts. For this much money much improvement is expected. I don't recommend. In fact I returned this and got a Bron which is the original mandoline maker. Will see how that works when it arrives. A cutting board and knife would be faster and easier to clean than this plastic thing. I wonder if some of the other favorable reviews were placed on Amazon by the manufacturer."
"Negative","Buy a slicker brush: Honestly, a $9 slicker brush took more loose undercoat off my Shelties than the Furminator, with less effort and fuss. In addition, it merely brushed the fur out, rather than cutting it out. Save your money."
"Negative","Walkfit with some other Kathy Smith Cassette: I found this tape disappointing - usually I like Kathy Smith, but this one wasn't up to her usual standard. The selections weren't especially energizing. If you're not a country music fan, there's just no reason to buy this tape."
"Positive","Providing the sinews of better music: One of the few musical acts that give me goose bumps, bring tears to my eyes and make my heart swell.Pure and honest audio heaven.Their music incredibly enhances the mood for love, life and imagination.If you're looking for alt-rock, gangsta-rap, reggeaton-dance, Top 40 corporate-pop, or death metal...keep looking.If you're tired of the holding patterns of the above music, and desire something absolutely incredible, stop looking."
"Positive","red dog: I've just bought this book after being impressed with some of Louis' other work. Its a thin book and easy to read. The flaw I found is that I can't help thinking that the real Red Dog is simply a wild dingo."
"Positive","It's good if you don't want many songs.: This mp3 player would be good for someone who doesn't have alot of songs in their playbook. The speakers are good if you have them just below full blast. I had a problem with the amplifer. It didn't work so i returned it. Make sure you know that this 256mb holds only 80 songs not 120. Most 256mb hold 120 songs. Overall this would be a great value for a person on a budget."
"Positive","watch with a open mind: Strike witches is one of the better amines I've seen. There is a good story line if you actually watch for it and the animation is great. Now it can get hard to see anything past the nudity of the girls but you have to understand that this is from Japan and there culture is different than ours.The voice over is pretty good but like all cartoons/anime the mouth does not move with the words correctly. it could have been better if aniplex did the production instead of funimation due to the fact that the unnatural beams of light wouldn't annoy people and they can stop complaining about it.Watch this on netflix first and save your self some time and money $8 is still cheaper than the asking price and if you like it you can order it like I did"
"Negative","Terrible for golfers who know the game: This book is for the real beginner as the title of the book is totally misleading"
"Negative","thermostat problem: this heater throws off great heat,however i purchased it so my room would stay at the same temp.i set it to 69 on 2nd setting.1 hr later went in and it was 78 degrees.if you dont care about thermostate setting get the one for 39 bucks. just as good."
"Negative","About as awful a work of fiction as you can find.: I absolutely loved the Mayfair witches novels - until ""Taltos."" Then the series took off in a direction that can only be classified as ""tripe."" Poor Anne Rice - I think she has finally run out of inspiration for her novels of the supernatural. Having suffered through ""Blackwood Farm,"" I thought, well, let's try one more time. Thank heaven Ms. Rice is putting the Vampire Lestate to bed (in fiction, at least - there's rumours of a Broadway musical, heaven forfend!). The legion of fans who have made Ms. Rice a best-selling author deserve better than this sloppy, boring, idiocy that passes for fiction. Pass it by and re-read ""The Witching Hour,"" if you need a Rice fix."
"Positive","More Great Hilary Stagg!: If you like harp and/or New Age music, titles by Hilary Stagg are for you. In addition to this album, I also own Dream Spiral and Sweet Return. Beautiful harp playing. Definitely satisfies the harp lover in you!"
"Positive","NOT WINTER BUT SUMMER!!!!!!: I BELIEVE THAT THIS BOOK WAS GOOD AS A MUG WITH COCOA IN IT. THE TITLE WAS SIMILAR TO THE COLDEST WINTER EVER BUT THE STORY WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. SUMMER AND WINTER IS JUST LIKE THE SEASONS NOT THE SAME. WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND SUMMER PROVED THAT TO US. I CAN'T WAIT FOR PART TWO OF THIS BOOK. IF YOU FEEL THIS WAS THE SAME AS SISTAH SOULJAH'S BOOK I SUGGEST YOU READ IT AGAIN BECAUSE THERE IS A MEANING IN THE BOOK YOU MUST LEARN."
"Positive","My 4 year colelge ramen bowl: This is a really late review for this product but I bought this bowl my freshman year in college for ramen, and its what I've been using it for the last four years now. This is a really late review but this bowl is perfect for your ramen!"
"Negative","No Danger of Sinking in this Shallow Water: This is the first Nicholas Sparks book that I have read. It reminds me of those romantic short stories that I read as a teen in my mother's ladies magazines, except for the fact that this shallow tale is told in 420 pages. That is 418 too many. Denise's son Kyle is not the only verbally challenged player in this arena. Denise and Taylor, as adult characters, exhibit little better use of the language or depth of character.This is our book discussion group's monthly selection, and , after reading Anna Quindlen, Wallace Stegner, Tracy Chaevalier, and Kaye Gibbons, the lack of depth--or even compound sentences--is all the more noticeable. All in all, it stretches the gamut of emotion and literary importance from A to A -."
"Negative","""The Crimson Pirate"": Terrible quality. This is an old TV print that has been ""formatted to fit this screen.""A great movie to which you have done a great injustice.\Shame on you!"
"Positive","Enjoyable reading: After reading many of the reviews I wonder, doesn't anyone read just for the fun of it anymore? No, this book was not a Classic, but it was very entertaining and well worth the money and time spent reading it. That's what writing is all about. Give the reader something to enjoy. Trevanian is very adept at doing just that."
"Negative","HORRIBLE: Did they clone Nicholson to be in this piece of crap? Worst writing I have ever had to suffer through (about 35 minutes before I just shut it down) - don't waste a nickel on this. Just horrible. Abysmal script, bad acting - I usually give a movie a chance, but this was just awful."
"Negative","another delay: First Amazon states 13th the game will become available. Now Amazon states 20th the game will become available. Whats the betting the date will be pushed back again and again and again?Amazon should only list products that are available now. The amount of times I pre order an item only to receive email after email telling me I can't have what I ordered.(...)"
"Negative","His recipes just don't work: This guy may be a feted author/chef/whatever but none of his recipes (the ones I have tried anyway) work. I have a couple of his books (cake and cookie) and I intend to chuck them out. I bake quite frequently and get it right 99% of the time including recipes from Martha Stewart, Susan Purdy, Doris Greenspan, Jim Foley...I can go on. Have never bothered writing a review before but everyone, please don't buy his books. And he sounds like a real prima donna."
"Positive","some of the best new rock: if you like built to spill, you'll love modest mouse, and vice versa. Originality, what a concept!"
"Negative","Bah.: I love the original book, but this one was filled with pictures and it came with no locket, which is what I wanted.No wonder it was on sale for a penny."
"Positive","Three Wise Men: I bought this set to compliment the Willow Tree Joseph, Mary and Jesus bought for my wife's birthday. When she opened the box she immediately liked it and began planning the place to put them at Christmas."
"Positive","Greatest album ever and not just because its my Dad!: I feel constrained by the 1000 word review so I will be brief. I love to sit back and listen to the music of the sixties. This is one of my favorites."
"Negative","Greed is their downfall!: First STUDIO releases SHOULD be complete, uncut and remastered WITH ORIGINAL Themes etc. W-B releases Cheyenne cut and slaughtered! SOME releases are worth it. Sony's Releases Season 1 of Fantasy Island (HIGH priced) and then stops! All this B.S. and now breaking Seasons up! PASS - There are MANY good sources of MANY TV series that are complete, good quality and reasonable! PASS on Big Valley Season 2 Part 1 Chaper 1 Disc 1 - These are not ""trading cards"" you buy individually! Idiots full of greed! And then THEY wonder why they don't sell as many as they thought they would! Go figure...."
"Negative","Sucker Born Every Minute: And I should know, because I bought and read this piece of tripe. She's insane. Don't waste your money or your brain cells, if you have any left after reading anything by Coulter. She's fourteen minutes into her fifteen of fame. Give it a rest, Ann. Go get some help - at least for your eating disorder, if not for your mental issues."
"Negative","Danger!!!: Beware! I purchased three of these as Easter gifts for my three boys, who are big Naruto fans. After about 30 minutes of play, my youngest son reported that his wrist was BURNING. I promptly unstrapped the cuff from his wrist. The plastic was very HOT and there was a strong scent of burning plastic in the air. I opened the battery compartment--the batteries were too hot to touch. I believe that had I not taken the batteries out they would have caught fire! I will return these to Target ASAP. Watch out parents, this toy is not safe!!!"
"Negative","Does not stay on my baby: I bought this for my baby cause everyone else seems to own them in CO. I used a ""shower cap"" cover with my first but it was cumbersome so thought I'd ""upgrade"" with my second. The Bundle Me is a great idea and I liked that the cover zipped off and on easily as CO has crazy weather- 60 and sunny one day and cold and snowy the next. But my son is too wiggly for it. As soon as I zip it up on him he wiggles and pulls the cover down and has even managed to kick his feet out of it. I've tried tucking it in but it's too bulky to stay tucked in. In my opinion it's not worth the money and a blanket works better at keeping my son warm."
"Negative","Buy a portable DVD Player!: I bought this for my 6 year old after Christmas as her cousin received one and loved it. I ran all over town trying to find the PVD's (which are hard to find a good selection of). I ended up purchasing some online. By the time the PVD's arrived, the player was no longer working. We have replaced the batteries several times. On a rare occasion, it will turn on, but that is very rare. We are very disappointed with this unit. I should have listened to my husband and bought the DVD player!"
"Negative","Don't Waste Your Money!!!: Please don't make the same mistake I did. Camera died after 1 month of use. Before it died, the pics were of poor quality. Lots of ""white"" flash in every photo, regardless of the lighting adjustments. After the camera died, I contacted Digital Blue. They won't stand behind these over priced poorly made cameras. They wouldn't even entertain the idea that it was a defective product. Disney really needs to end their relationship with Digital Blue."
"Positive","This little lady gets down deep - a future legend: I have not herd a blues singer like this in a long while. And she's a little white polish girl! Great backup band. Want to see her live very much. If Susan can survive the Blues life ahead, she will be huge in the next milenium."
"Negative","Not a good book for beginners: I am starting my professional career in makeup artistry, but this has been a hobby of mine for 20 years. This book does have great information. It has solid foundation/building blocks explaining the different tools & types of makeup. It does not have great instructional steps for a beginner. Get a Kevyn Aucoin book like, ""The Art of Makeup"". There are much better instructional steps in that book. I was planning on getting ""Makeup Makeovers: Weddings"" by the same author and decided to get this one because it's available via Kindle. Huge disappointment. I disagree with the shape assessments and it's too difficult to match a face to his description because it's not on the same page. I will not purchase that book after this huge let down. Once again there is good reference material in here and I'll be able to use a bit of what is offered in this book, however I knew most of the information in this book already."
"Positive","Very good but not perfect: This is a very good product. I recommend them. It cancels the low and repetitive sounds very well. The mid range is reduced somewhat (just as the manufacturer described). They are not perfect but I found the issues were within expectations.- The size of the ear cup was just big enough, any smaller and it would be an issue. I am a medium sized guy.- they do 'leak' noise. But the volume must be somwwhat high and someelse must be within 2 feet. On an airplane the person next to you may hear you if you play load but it is still less than the engine noise.- The head fit and adjustment was fine.- The full ear cups get hot when you are working. But they do help with the external sound.- The sound production is fine.- They are well constructed.- The case is very good also"
"Positive","A roadmap to the dead end.: This is a very detailed account of the way the Chicago power elite responded to the Great Migration. Detailed, in fact, to the point of opacity. This is a scholarly work written with peer review in mind and therefore crafted for an academic audience.Nonetheless, it was able to give a person unfamiliar with Chicago and urban life (I was raised in the desert) an understanding of the forces that shaped the southside and westside ghettos."
"Negative","A Divine Disappointment: Wonderful intentions on Mister Edwards's part. Sadly, missed it for me and my stylistic preferences. For a book to give you a warm feeling about how much God loves you in a time when you are already pretty much convinced thereof, it probably rates more like four stars. To address God's love for you amidst less than wonderful circumstances and even get by the tendency to cynicism that results in that state, I would suggest THE SACRED ROMANCE by Brent Curtis and John Eldredge."
"Positive","Great for Middle and High School kids: I recently read that one reason that kids these days have mor trouble with comprehension than in the past is because they have not learned enough grammer to understand complex esentences. This is a great game to help with that. I bought this for two teenage nieces who did not want to play it at first. After two rounds of the game, they loved it."
"Positive","This was so funny: I saw this movie at a preview screening in L.A. and I thought it was amazing.... it was such a cute, original story and all the actors were great. Clive Owen (who was in Croupier last year) was especially good - he is going to be a big star. This is a movie for everyone who loved Saving Grace and Waking Ned Devine."
"Negative","Lids aren't lids: I ordered these bowls specifically because they had lids, but what I got were some great stainless bowls with lids that are worthless. The lids simply don't fit on these bowls. You can't possibly get them to fit, they are too small for the bowls. I thought I was dumb and just tried them again the next day and they still didn't fit. So now I have 3 great stainless bowls without lids. Thank god for Saran Wrap."
"Positive","Good: Pretty good movie. I like the way the movie talk about gun control and media influence. I would recommend this movie~"
"Negative","Boring and Redundant: Does the apple fall far from the tree? In this case - miles away. This book is full of boring and redundant metaphors and cliches. It reads like a work from a grade school creative writing class in bad need of editing. I am surprised the publisher let so much obvious inexperience slip through. Was the editor sleeping through the book as I did most of the time? Nothing new under the sun in reference to the plot or characters. It's all been done and said before by many authors, including her father, whom I'd read since ""A Stone for Danny Fisher"" and despite the the lack of popularity with the critics, he managed to tell a riveting story. This book comes no where close to doing that. If I could, I would have rated it 1/2 a star just because it managed to get published, for it lacks any literary merit."
"Positive","Grapse the essense of the exam: I have read through this book. THe framework is well structured and easy to read as well as understand the main points for the exam.Though occassionally errors were found in this book, but the errors were not the critical/fundamental items.This book help me to gain better understanding to the content of the PMBOK. Extract is also provided. It is worth to take time read through the book prior to the PMP exam."
"Positive","A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!: This cd is simply incredible, I am not a huge fan of pop music and would refuse my sister's pleas to stop bashing *NSYNC and listen to their old CD. That was untill I heard ""NSA"" and it stunned me. I love everything about this cd and it was the only thing to come along in a while and take playing time away from my Godsmack CD. I definatly recommend it to anyone that listens to music. *NSYNC forever BSB never!"
"Positive","Straight from the heart!: Reading this book is like having a caring friend help you understand your relationships. Linda Marks shares examples from her own life to show how we can honor our most loving impulses toward our children, friends, and partners and move toward the important task of waging peace in our personal lives."
"Negative","Live in Concert With Mick Taylor! and the Return Of Bill Wyman! Watch And See!: This is all being set up for a possible world tour featuring Bill Wyman on bass and Mick Taylor on guitar watch and see if this dosent happen! everyone will pay for that one! and that's how they are going to go out!"
"Negative","A hodge-podge of personal trivia: I doubt this would have been published if Crichton weren't Crichton. Just a hodge-podge of stuff - medical school, a few good travel essays, a lot of paranormal stuff - energy balancing, auras, channeling, etc. etc. I see a lot of readers loved it, but I thought it was a waste of time."
"Positive","Works pretty well, except around knees and curves: Like this epilator. It's my first one, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It does hurt at first, but then you get used to it. I am also getting obsessed with using it more and more! Love it on my underarms (don't be scared, it feels so good to get rid of all the hair). Also-use the loofah before in the shower, it helps prevent ingrowns. Generally like it and am happy with my purchase, but I have trouble getting my knees clear."
"Positive","The first time tasting an olive: If you first tried olives as a child, perhaps at one's parents dinner party in a little silver dish (and hopefully not, sadly, the canned variety), you might recall thinking, ""yuck! Nasty! Now I want more.""That is this voice. Delishously unpleasant, ugly in a handsome way. Good musianship throughout - thank God - these cantatas I have played a hundred times with pleasurable distaste each time."
"Positive","Over 5 years later, I still love it!: Although this mill is currently unavailable on Amazon, the company's website shows that Unicorn is very much in business and still offering the Magnum Plus. I purchased mine through Amazon over 5 1/2 years ago, after going through several unsatisfactory mills. A few minutes ago, while in the kitchen refilling the mill's generous reservoir, I thought about how much we've enjoyed using it and what a good product it's been. I won't reiterate the features of this pepper mill; others, including Nina, have done a fine job of that. My only disagreement with Nina's review is a minor one: I don't object to the mill's looks. I've found its appearance, heft, and performance to be just what I want for daily use. This pepper mill is holding up well with regular use by lovers of fresh-ground pepper. If/when we have to replace it, I'd definitely buy this one again, or, if unavailable, another similar mill made by Unicorn."
"Negative","hp 88 printhead, bad bad bad: This is the worst product from hp. Do not last enough time in use for it high cost. It is very complicate to clean and service. Epson is very very very best than hp and costs a fraction than hp. So, I'll never buy any hp product in the future. Don't waste your money."
"Negative","A GOOD SLEEP: With these sheets, I love getting into bed at night. The smooth texture feels good on the skin, and on a cool night they are cozy warm. My only criticism is that they need to be ironed to look nice."
"Negative","Didn't live up to the hype.: I chose the least expensive model for this device. The concept is a good one; however, the voice activation feature is inaccurate. It dials the incorrect party often. More times than not, it does not recognize my voice command, thus, I am reduced to using my handset to dial.The earpiece does not fit my ear and often shifts while I am driving (even though I have an average-shaped ear, close to my head). I press the device close in order to hear properly. In addition, I cannot tell when the device has turned itself off. The device is worth what I paid for it, no more. Do yourself a favor and buy the higher-priced model. Better yet, go to a store to experience the Bluetooth (or some other brand) before you purchase same. The engineer who designed this model needs to go back to the drawing-board."
"Negative","Snowscoop Disappointment: Tried my new scoop out two days ago in 3-4"" of wet, lake effect in Northern Michigan. This was exactly what I bought this item for. I have a push scoop on two wheels but it is too shallow and leaves a line of snow on either edge. I thought this scoop would allow the snow upwards on the scoop itself and eliminate this problem. This did not happen. The snow went up about a foot and then built up on the driveway in front of same. This made it difficult to push and hard on my back. The website says it works well in just this situation, wet and deep. No way!Granted the snow was wet and so was also sticking to my snow shovels. The advertising on the website is extremely misleading however. I also told the guy in Texas (official website) that I wanted it for 3-4 inches of wet snow. He said no problem (in so many words).I have written an email to the website and have had no response.I put some silicone spray on last night and will see if this helps. Oh, it also needs two wheels."
"Positive","Funny Offbeat Story: This story adapts a traditional children's song by pulling it into our contemporary world. Most of us don't go to the market anymore to buy a whole pig or cow, and the illustrator highlights this gap in time by showing what happens when one woman does bring all these animals home. The result is both thoughtful and silly: I love a children's book that doesn't take itself too seriously!As you can imagine, the animals run loose and create havoc in the kitchen while the overwhelmed woman goes back to the market for more things. Finally in desperation, she buys a bunch of vegetables and makes them all soup!It's an artsy little story that you can read over and over again without getting bored. The illustrations are witty and creative throughout. I appreciate inventive touches in this book, like the black and white background juxtaposed against the color foreground. Also, I like the way the market background is reminiscient of an earlier time period, perhaps the 50's or 60's?"
"Negative","No Freddie, no good.: It is unimaginable to think of a Basie album without Freddie Green, not to mention several tunes with electric bass guitar. This, along with Basie with strings, are among the very very few lousy Count Basie albums. Don't bother with this one. Pablo should be ashamed for releasing it."
"Positive","Waterworld 10 Year Anniversary: I enjoyed Waterworld very much. Next year, 2005, is the movie's ten year anniversary. Kevin Costner and Universal should consider a multi-disk DVD release which includes the extended version plus extras. At the very least a re-release which includes as many deleted scenes as possible, even if they are not included in the movie itself. I vaguely remember seeing a short feature on TV that showed construction of the Atoll and other movie sets. If that's the case, that should also be included."
"Negative","THIS DISC SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN RECORDED: I love Frank Sinatra, which is the reason I do not like this disc. None of the duets were recorded with both parties in the room together, and you can here it. It's electronic gimmickry. The duets are done with people who do not sing in the Pop style that Sinatra sings in; therefore, the songs are uneven and sound bad. Sinatra is also not in good form. He is 77 and I don't think he should have recorded this. I prefer to remember him in the 1950's, when I think he was at his best. I would not buy this, unless you want to hear his next to last recording. Duets II is the last one. I woulnd't buy that one either."
"Negative","Great til it breaks, and it will: The design was great. I liked the functionality and interface with the exception of the camera turning on randomly in my pocket. About three months with it though, the face cracked (apparently a common problem with this phone). It did not affect the function of the phone and I used it for another three months. Without dropping it, sticking it in water or any other normal reason, the phone died on me. Luckily for the manufacturer, they don't have to replace it because the crack in the face excuses them. Smart on their part to design a flimsy face so that when their phone does die they can blame it on that, and you are SOL."
"Positive","FANTASTIC !: This scissor knife is unbelievable ! It works amazingly for someone with hand control problems and is SO tough and SHARP, you won't believe it."
"Negative","WAS NOT WHAT I ORDERED: This set was NOT what I ordered. The tools were correct however the stand that holds them looked NOTHING like this photo. Luckily my husband did not mind...BUT I DID!!!"
"Positive","Classic Comedy: It is great to be able to get movies that were around long before DVD. The quality was great and you wouldn't know it was from 1978. Funny, original, love it."
"Negative","Loose fit: I do not recommend this item due to it's poor workmenship. It worked fine when I first put it in, but it was a very loose fit. When I took it off to try to adjust it, I could not get the screw back out because the screw sheath had broken free from the housing. I can not get the screw out or reinstall it because the plastic piece is in the way. So it is useless to me. A waste of money."
"Negative","Grapes on a Vine: I did not like the movie. I did not like the plot. Someone else may like that type of movie. It was not a good ending to me."
"Positive","Great Performance: This movie is a classic. Once again Nicholas Cage comes through with a great performance. I could watch this movie again and again."
"Negative","WORST HOLIDAY MOVIE EVER - EXPECT TEARS AND NIGHTMARES.: Seriously. What lunatic thought this movie was a good idea?My kids are not super sensitive. But really what kid wants to watch Santa get hit by a car, mugged, and end up with a head injury?And what kid wants to see a kid in a foster home get her only toy thrown into an incinerator? Which we get to watch by the way as the doll dramatically catches fire?I don't know what happened after that because I turned it off.STAY AWAY!!!!"
"Negative","A disappointing waste of time: This book came as a big disappointment especially as I was so looking forward to reading it. The plot is incredibly weak, the characters shallow and their reactions and emotions unbelievable. The pace is slow and half the time one isn't sure exactly what is going on. She uses a unique style of writing dialogue so that one isn't always sure who is speaking. The saving grace is that in some parts the style is good and there are some paragraphs which are quite well written and readable. For the rest, a boring and definitley not recommended read. Pity ..."
"Negative","A Mockery of the Christian Faith: This film was a total mockery of the Christian Faith and I was offended by it. If hollywood was mocking the Islamic Faith or Buddism, etc., our country would be up and arms about it. It looks to me that Christians are still being persecuted for their faith in Jesus Christ even in America. Remember, America was founded on God and our country is all about freedom. The only real freedom is the freedom found in Christ alone."
"Negative","Kind of Disappointed: I truthfully wanted to enjoy this book. I really did. After reading this book, I now believe that there's very little point in analyzing what didn't happen as opposed to what did. It also seems like any historian can make up any silly hypothetical situation and write about it. For instance, the first chapter about how things would be different if the wind blew the Mayflower in a different direction. Well, sure, I don't think you can argue against that. What if aliens came down and gave President Truman the technology to develop the nude bomb? It seemed to me like that would have been just as valid of an essay to read.Maybe I'm not being fair. There are some essays on key moments in American history, such as what if JFK wasn't shot. Unfortunately for me, I found the essays about the key moments in American history to be boring. And I love reading about history.Other people here seemed to have loved this book, so I may be wrong."
"Negative","Did Susan Sizemore really write this?: I LOVED Susan Sizemore's vampire novels and decided to give her romance books a try. Boy was I shocked. The writing seemed amateurish, the typeface huge and the prose so incredibly purple I wondered if this was the same author.The story? Cleo is the devoted daughter of a famous archaeologist and a spinster. She's in love with a man named Angel. (Sigh). We don't find out much about the man for many chapters only that he's decided he wants to marry her. Cleo is your typical doormat heroine. First sacrificing for her father then for her sisters. The entire first chapter she spends 'needing' and 'wanting.' What does that mean? Also the frequent flashbacks in italics drove me nuts.I cannot recommend this novel. The writing was very banal. I'm sorely disappointed."
"Positive","Excellent Bouquet with a twist of sanity.: Entertaining, thought provoking and a ""mind stir"". Excellent independent film! Would be a better world with more films like this."
"Negative","Worst Toy Ever: My son received this as a gift and played with it once. Play-doh gets stuck in the cracks, making it difficult to clean. The markers and crayons do not fit in the alotted slots. There are so many other things that are wrong with it. I should have returned it when I had the chance."
"Negative","fine for espresso and drip: Really wanted a bean grinder that could grind for all types of coffee. The package said this one could, so I bought it. I didn't know much about coffee or coffee tools, so I had an excuse. This type of blade grinder is great for espresso (very fine) and drip (medium to fine), but when I try to do a course grind, it is impossible to grind all the beans without over grinding some. So when I use my coffee press I invariably end up with coffee bean in my mug.If you want to use a French press, I would suggest a burr grinder which allows the beans to fall through the blades and into a separate container."
"Negative","A big disappointment: I've enjoyed Pearson's Lou Boldt novels, and bought this one with great expectations. What a letdown! The characters are stereotypes without depth or passion, the villain is implausible (he's supposed to be a ruthless monomaniac, but pauses for a wistful fling with a waitress he knew years ago). To top it off, no one appears to have proofread the book -- on a single page, for example, Pearson describes a call girl walking ""with a somewhat shaky gate"" and a ""Mercedes coup"" paused at a traffic light. These flaws were so annoying that I couldn't even get to page 100 before tossing the book aside. My guess is that Pearson wrote this manuscript when he was a kid and dusted it off for publication now that his name is well-known. Certainly he can do (and has done) MUCH better than this."
"Negative","I would give this 0 stars.: I cannot even finish this book. This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I am so glad I got it from the library and did not pay for it. I would throw it in the trash and I love books. How are you supposed to read a romance about a ""hero"" that is continually raping the heroine. Then everyone around her acts like it is no big deal and she should be happy about it because he is hansome. This book is discusting. I don't care if it gets better because I just can't take it anymore. It has been years since I didn't finish a book but I cannot read one more line of this book."
"Positive","A REAL TRIBUTE TO VIET NAM VETERANS: This film is the pinnacle of the way life and death befell the soldiers of the ""Viet Nam Conflict"". As depicted in this movie, men fought for there own reasons but when it came to dying most gave by committing the ultimate sacrifice, for love of their fellow soldiers. Boy's From Company C had shown historicism, not a story. If you want to know why Viet Nam Vets are shy heros or why the Viet Nam war is not taught in history classes in school watch this movie, it will scare the heck out of you, or at the very least, remind you respect those vets. PS: To David Lee, They Are Not Forgotten. We will always take a glance back to where they can no longer go."
"Negative","Who would ever want to read this book?: I can't believe anyone would want to read a gruesome book like this. I mean I like vampire books, but most of them are fiction ya know? This sounds like a very depressing story and I feel bad for the people involved in the whole thing"
"Negative","Disappointment: I purchased this DVD to see Rin-Tin-Tin but he is not in any of the movies mainly because he died before this films were made. Rin-Tin-Tin Jt is the dog start in each movie. This fact was not stated on the advertisement or the cover of the DVD."
"Negative","Bad: I really liked the way this novel started out, but a proper PLOT didn't really develop as I'd hoped. It read more like a biography, where a series of incidents occur--dramatic ones, admittedly--but with nothing that made me turn the pages once I realized it was ""follow a lawyer's zaney career."" Stuff just kind of happens to the protagonist, with nothing for him to resolve. He makes moral adjustments, but basically because HE HAS NO CHOICE."
"Negative","interesting concept, poorly done: This movie looked interesting and had an interesting plot, but, it didnt live up to it. It was boring, I didn't care about the characters and the story had no development. I thought there would be some great revelation or lesson, I was waiting for a plot twist, but in the end there was nothing. Dont waste your time."
"Positive","A Practical Umbrella: A practical umbrella with air vents that really do help prevent blustery days from yanking it out of your hands or bringin it suddenly to ruination ,as is common with cheaper models. I am very happy with mine, although I would have liked to see a more elegantwood handle and tip."
"Negative","Needs A Rewrite: While I'm sure this is a classic book, it's very difficult to read. It's a fairly deep subject and that combined with the poor writing makes it really tough to get through. I wish I had known that before I bought it.I'm really surprised given all the glowing reviews.Just be warned. Good content but will take some serious effort to get through."
"Negative","Good idea that just didn't work.: The design is good, but the sprinkler won't rotate on any kind of an incline. If you yard has a hill in it, this just won't work."
"Positive","A Good Book to Start: I have to admit that I really don't know that much about the life of F. Scott Fitzgerald. But I had read such good things about this book that I wanted to read it.That being said, I think this would be a good book for anyone who doesn't know alot about this man. It gives some interesting information about his first romance. Plus, it is a short book and easy to read.Also, the historical background on the way life was back then was very interesting."
"Positive","Great little clamp with lots of power: I have had this clamp for a while and I use it all the time for securing boards while routing, clamping on guides and jigs as well as temporary faces on my table saw fence. It is a great size and has plenty of holding power to fit most needs.This clamp is easier to carry around and use when compared with the heavy duty version."
"Positive","Perfect for Cats!: Wonderful top opening makes it easy to place the cat into (and out of)the carrier without a struggle. It's easy to fit and secure in the car with a seatbelt. Love the pocket on the end to place a few essentials. Sturdy construction, so the bag will last. My cats are comfortable traveling in the bag and will even use it as a place to sleep when at home. Much better than the hard sided carriers."
"Negative","Not good quality: These tambourines are in horrible condition. They look as though they were soaked in grease before shipment. I am very disappointed with this product and Amazon for selling such a product. However, I did receive the items in a timely manner. I have scheduled a return of these items."
"Negative","Too Much Attitude: Bridgewater's theatrical experience definitely works against her on this CD. The vocal posturing annoys and distracts. Her material is excellent, and her band really cooks. Drop the coy mannerisms and just sing, Dee Dee."
"Positive","Crystal's Evening in Tennessee: Spend a night with Crystal Gayle at The Renaissance Center in Dickson, Tennessee. Crystal does 22 songs, some written by her sister Loretta Lynn, some traditional songs, some gospel and the songs that brought her national attention. I give this DVD four stars. We are treated to an in-depth interview with her and some of her family members, This is worth listening to and watching if youu'd also like to know the members that make up her band."
"Positive","check out this cd!: This cd was extremely professional in both its production and overall sound. For an amateur musician with little to no formal training, I found Spencer's vocal talent to be striking and his overall musical expertise to be superior. With its deeply personal lyrics, every listener is able to relate in some way with the album."
"Positive","Exceptional fire video: I show this to my students every semester and they have all enjoyed it and came away with the proper perspective of the tragedy. Not a ""gore"" flick but an accurate accounting of an American tragedy."
"Negative","This review is about Amazon: I ordered the Millennium season 3 boxed set Dec. 2007. I never received it. Now one year later Amazon has charged my account for this boxed set which I still have never received. They said they would credit back the charge to my bank account, but it has been two weeks and I still haven't seen that credit."
"Positive","one of my favs: let's put it this way, this books is so good that even classics can't stand in its way. I can almost guarantee that once you read this book, it will be one of your all time favs and your review will be very similar to mine."
"Positive","Ok, but ...: The Pinzon Bath Towel appears to be well-made and is quite plush and soft. It is also quite large and looks rich and luxurious hanging on the towel rack.Unfortunately, in terms of function - its ability to dry you after you shower or bathe - it is not significantly better than my Target-brand cheapies. Despite the towel's plushness, it is not as absorbent as you might expect based on it thickness and weight.I thought that, perhaps, the manufacturer had treated the towel with fabric softener to make it feel soft to prospective buyers but which would also partially waterproof it. But after laundering (without fabric softener), I found little improvement in absorbency.If your towel's appearance is important to you, these are fine and work reasonably well. If your considering it as a functional improvement over your current towel, I think you'll be disappointed."
"Negative","Sadly Disappointng: After hearing the airplay of ""Wasting My Time"" I thought this disc would have at least a couple songs that were comparable, but I soon found out it didnt. I truly believe that Chad Kroeger influenced this band way too much, and it wasnt a very good influence. All of their songs and discs are just not original, and are unflattering attempts at mimicking other bands styles, and fail. Like I always say, if you are going to try to be someone else, you better do it far better fashion than the original. Otherwise you are just wasting everyones time. I think the band COULD be something if they found their own direction, and let loose. But so far they havent. I give this 2 stars only for the one good song."
"Negative","Not so hot..: They say its kink resistant. NOPE... much thinner than I had anticipated... spend the extra $$ and get a thicker model. It kinks as it rolls up into my reel AFTER I've cranked it on the spool... haven't figured that one out yet. you get what you pay for.."
"Negative","Tour of Duty DVD: Tour of Duty Fans beware of this product. The original music (Jimi Hendrix, CCR, Marvin Gaye etc)which significantly contributed to the quality of the TV series has been replaced in the DVD version with terrible generic music. I loved the original series but wish I had my money back on this product!!"
"Positive","Great buy: This mouthwash is very gentle on the gums and it does seems to freshen your breathe and soothe your gums! It does kind of have the consistency of saliva but a little thinner, but it didn't really bother me. You aren't supposed to eat or drink 30 minutes after using it and after that time period any flavor is gone, it doesn't effect the taste of anything. I am happy with this purchase!"
"Positive","Great Book: This is a very well written and well researched book. The findings are presented in an easy to understand fashion."
"Negative","Way out in left field: This book is regurgitated Karl Marx. Everyone remembers his spoutings about industry and its relation to class struggle but he was very opinionated on how to raise children to fit in with his vision of a socialist Utopia. And Hillary Clinton's viewpoints mirror his nearly word for word. Maybe people think his writings are too old for it to be labeled plagiarism but it's like she copied it and added a word or two of her own once in a while."
"Positive","very sweet: My 4 yr old loves Little Bear. The characters are very sweet and teach lessons of life. Well worth it in today's world with all the trash on TV for kids."
"Negative","Faulty electric: I bought this item and within the first couple times I used it, it made a crackling noise and then shut off. After a few minutes it started again, I was able to finish my hair. That scared me, so I only used the High setting for short periods of time. A couple weeks later, I was drying my hair, it made the crackling noise and started throwing sparks. Not worth the money in my book."
"Positive","Excellent music at a great value!!: I love this album. I noticed in was in a Christmas display last year and the person using the music said he saw this group with a big name artist at a concert. Very talented musicians, would buy more of their stuff."
"Positive","Fun & Educational & Fun: Another great BMC product (with King and Country permission's) they have a plastic copy of the raising of the flag on Iwo Jima. Great Japanese figures in many poses and the Marine figures are great as well the mountain is nice the landing craft which you can buy separately to add to their number and the small US Tank a Sherman I think. This set is as good as you will ever get for the price. Check out their D-Day set, San Juan Hill, Gettysburg, sadly no more little Big Horn set but you can buy the figures. A great toy to teach some American History ."
"Negative","BAD!: Maybe it is just me but it has no power it takes me 3 times as long to dry hair with this dryer than my other one. The cord retracts too fast and whips around to hit your hand. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone."
"Negative","Should my daughter listen to God or to Dobson???: God has told my daughter to become a doctor, she is so bright, and will save lives. And God has told her to have children, she would make a wonderful mother. God wants this, my daughter wants this, and I want this. But wait we forgot to check with the master authoriy..Dobson. Dobson's commandment says girls can't have careers and children too. Shall my daughter listen to God, or to Dobson?My daughter will listen to God. Dobson will be bitterly disappointed. For a moment there, he will be reminded he is not God."
"Negative","Correction: A slight correction to my previous review: apparently all available prints of this film are missing a brief scene of about 30 seconds duration. Please disregard the following: ""This one is also missing almost 30 seconds from a key scene."" My other comments stand. I like the film, I just wish Image had done a better job, and found a better print."
"Positive","Much better than I expected . .. .: Decent performances, but EXCEPTIONAL message! Touches big on everything from faith, marriage, and family to drugs and AIDS. Good soundtrack and some funny parts too. I am very, very glad to have this film. It might be low-budget, but they really focused on a strong message, and I think that was a very good choice!"
"Negative","The Filmmakers Should Be DAMNED!: This is truly a lousy film, one of the worst of all time. The villian, played by deceased recording artist Ailiyah, doesn't make an appearance until 45 minutes into the film. Even then, her presence is too brief to establish any sort of feelings pro or con toward her character.Her character doesn't take any actions until the movie is almost over. The total onscreen time for the antagonist is probably not much more than 10 minutes. Ailiyah had more quality time onscreen in her music video promo for the film.If all you expect is to watch MTV for a couple of hours, then this is the movie for you. The plot--if you can call it one--is weak, uninspired, unimaginative. This movie is worth watching for free, let alone paying for it."
"Negative","4the$: clearly coulter knows what her audience wants and is willing to give it up for them. she offers little objective reasoning for her 'thoughts' other than the number of copies of her writings she can pass off. strickly a by the numbers marketing piece, coulter can write a conservative book as well as a gardening one...."
"Negative","Go to Harbor Freight: I bought the same equipment yesterday at Harbor Freight for $7.99. Different brand, same stuff."
"Negative","Cheaply Made & Uncomfortable: I don't mind that it's low to the ground, but the chair is very cheaply made. At a local store it wouldn't sell for more than $10. The bar under your legs in painful. Mine came with the armrests all nicked up. It's difficult to adjust the reclining position. It's heavier than described. Also, it's kinda painful to carry on your back because of lack of padding."
"Negative","Covers fell off immediately: The paper is fine, but the spiral binding is of poor quality. The front and back cover of the book fell off in the first five minutes of use."
"Positive","Best of the Best: This CD is HOT. Deitrich Hadden has done it; combining gospel with diverse flavor. It's comtemporary, yet filled with traditional values and old-time gospel sounds. The message is unmistakable; God is a ""Chain Breaker"". This music reaches the young and the not so young. God bless Deitrick Hadden and his mission to spread the gospel."
"Negative","disappointed: I received this as a gift. The bracelet is dainty. The sapphires are a dark blue, but the luster is ok. The quality of the diamonds do not meet all the specifications advertised. I can see black spots on several of the diamonds on my bracelet. They are more of an I than SI. I'd return this if it wasn't a gift. If I had known the quality would be below what was advertised, I would have asked for jewelry from costco. I will not be buying jewelry from amazon again without a certificate."
"Positive","A surprising good sound: I never thought in a million years that I'd own an O-Town CD, and I liked it! It totally surprised me. There are uptempo songs and ballads and it's a must have for any O-Town fan. This CD is kinda letting everyone know they want to be around in the music business for a long time."
"Positive","fun movie: This is another hard to find in the store Andrew McCarthy movie that just is good for the soul. Lots of fun and laughter with a happy ending."
"Negative","Can't say I noticed much of anything: First off - if you decide to buy this product, be aware that there are 3 different sellers offering California Poppy Extract on Amazon. You can save yourself a few dollars on your order by picking the lowest price vendor.I puchased this product on the claims that it would help me sleep more deeply and to enter some very vivid (potentially even lucid) dream states. The fact that it was also touted as a painkiller was an added bonus, as I suffer chronic knee pain. After trying doses of anywhere from 20 to 60 drops prior to bed time, I think I may have felt slightly more relaxed, but I did not have noticeably more vivid dreams. Furthermore, I didn't feel any impact on my mild insomnia. I slept just as restlessly and still found myself waking frequently throughout the night.As for eliminating pain, I also felt no improvement while using this product."
"Positive","Waffles Again: I read all the reviews and looked at several different brands, and this was the best choice for the money. We have only used it once (it is now just my wife and I), but it worked perfect. But I made sure we did a few things, like letting it pre-heat, spraying the grills, and making sure we had a good batter made. We had one of the old school ones and made the mistake of letting a family borrow it, and then it was never returned (long story). I like having the abilty to flip the grills, put probably won't. I can also see who the grills could fall out as they are held by two metal clips, but I also see that if that happened, just gently bending those clips in a little would fix it. We do not have any issues with un-even heat or cooking areas. I would recommend this to anyone. Didn't give it 5 stars just because it isn't has ""heavy"" as our old one."
"Negative","Boring: When I finished with this book (and that was a struggle), I kept trying to analyze why it was so tedious. The crazy family part of the book was mildly interesting, but the main characters are simply too nice to be believable. There's not a fault in any of them -- other than a little emotional backwardness -- so there's really no dramatic tension at all, although there's plenty of sophomoric psychology 101, which was way, way overdone. Personally, I like characters with a little bit of an edge to their personalities to keep a book interesting. When you couple unintriguing characters with a very thin plot, you have a deadly dull read."
"Positive","fun card game: Rat-a-tat-Cat is the best card game to play with kids, ever! It is both fun and challenging. With young children (5-10) it's best to play with 4 cards, 2 up and two down, so they can remember the values. Also, play to the end of the cards or until the child saysRat-a-tat Cat so that the child has more control and can win more easily. With older kids, you can follow the rules."
"Negative","mini cooper sure is mini: Would have helped if there was a measurement description. Way smaller than what I exepcted. Won't get fooled again."
"Negative","Beware: Magnets are paper over wood: These magnets are very cute - bright colors and I love that the materials are non-toxic. However, I was expecting magnets made of wood. The core is wood, but the face is paper, which comes off. Disappointing."
"Negative","not worth the money: i have 1 cat and i have gone throught 3 automatic litter maid boxes in the last 3.8 years, i called the company and they did nothing cause there's only 1 year warrinty, i belive the motors burned up cause the litter would get stuck, i followed all directions & kept the litter below the red line & used premium litter, i feel the litter maid is over priced for the amount of use you get out of it, so i'm on the hunt for a new litter box, trust me it will NOT be another litter maid."
"Negative","I'd rather watch paint dry.: I've been watching this steaming pile of feces on tv for 85 minutes and I just can't take it any longer. Well, that's not entirely true. I've mostly been watching a cricket on the outside of my window. It has moved so little that I'm not sure it's alive, but it's way more interesting than Ghouls. Better plot and dialog, much more realistic special effects. I could tell you what's wrong with this flick, but I value my sanity too much to think about it. Besides, it's so easy to tell you what's right about it: nothing. Not a thing. Nada. Zip. It's not that I don't like z grade horror movies. I've cheerfully rented and then bought many horror flicks so bad that I would be ashamed to name them. But even I have some standards. Excuse me now, I have to go whack myself on the head with a big hammer until I forget all about this horrible flick."
"Positive","Very Good Paper...: This paper works wonderfully in my printer (a Canon I860). This is no wrinkly lightweight paper that feels cheap to the touch. The ink on the printed page looks crisp and even on this smooth, heavyweight paper. Gives a very professional appearance. I'll probably buy this paper again from Amazon rather than trudge down to Office *** or Staples to buy the bargain stuff."
"Positive","A true classic: I just went to a TMBG concert in which they played Flood in its entirety, and was reminded what a great album it really is. Hot Cha is probably the weakest song, and it's not that bad - and it's pretty much the only song I'd even call weak. This andFactory Showroomare probably the only two TMBG albums that I would say are winners straight through (although I haven't listened to their kids albums - yet). Others, like Apollo 18 or The Else, are a mix of hits and misses, but these two just keep on delivering. And of course, this album contains Birdhouse In Your Soul, probably the single best song the Johns have recorded.If you're here because you've bought their music for your kids and are curious what their adult music sounds like, Flood is absolutely the place to start."
"Negative","It's terrible-: This movie is completey awful- it trys to be a sci-fi, horror and comedy all rolled into one. the point is- it fails on them all. the script is garbage, the effects are even worse, and the acting is baaaaaddd!!! There also doesn't seem to be anything going on in it- there's a couple of monsters and THAT'S IT! The ending is pointless and stupid and none of it is funny- okay, the part where he meets his next-door neighbour and he talks about his mum- that's funny. The rest of it is bad though- spend your money on a rubiks cube or something"
"Negative","Stupid.: Went with friends in search of a raunchy, stupid buddy flick. What we got was a movie, so raunchy and stupid, it lacked heart and comedy.And why in the hell is Republican Senator John McCain in this movie?Anyways, it was a complete disappointment and I regret paying to see it."
"Positive","I was turned onto: This group a few years ago and just love them. I love the sense of humor that comes out in their music as well as the love ballads. If you like Sister Hazel, you'll like this cd as much as the others."
"Negative","Banal Banal Banal... No Kidding!!!: It's stupid, of course. Jennifer ""No Range"" Anniston is in it. She plays, once again, a semi-ditzy princess with man problems. Gerard Butler reprises his mouth paralysis delivery. Talk about type-cast. He even manages to wear the same clothes in every movie. Are sofa bound middle-class Americans this pathetic, that they lap up this trash for entertainment. I hope not. Airplane movie where you sleep through most, luckily."
"Positive","A TRUE MASTERPECE: I loved alot of songs on this cd and my favorites were Alabama, Mutiny Isq. But my personal favoriteone was Roll Tide. A true masterpice I wouldn't lie to anyone and recomend this to every one to enjoy."
"Negative","POOR PRODUCT: Thisis the most worthless product...very dissappointed...it never even attempted to get cool,much less 40 degrees...box is misleading"
"Positive","2006 Giving Tree Gift: This was specifically requested by a parent for a Christmas Charity Gift Drive present."
"Negative","Died after 4 years: Thought I was safe buying a Sony product. It was great when it worked, but for no reason it just died. 9 blinks of the standby light. Best bet is to replace the PC board to fix the problem. $300 to fix by a pro! Now I am stuck trying to decide if it is worth the money to repair it, or chuck it aside and buy a new TV. Preferably NOT a Sony!Google this model. LOTS of unsatisfied customers!"
"Positive","Some real gems here...: After listening to Mr. Armstrong's work on albums such as the Moulin Rouge and Rome + Juliet soundtracks, I was really looking forward to seeing what he did on his own. While some tunes here are WAY too sentimental for me, the majority (especially the instrumental pieces) are wonderful. Soaring, simple melodies that take you from here to there and back again... It's one of the reasons why music is so powerful."
"Negative","sucks: I was interested in reading this book, thinking to myself that, yes i am going to finally stop eating out. But yes i was very much so wrong. It had nothing to do with the Fast Food Nation, Mcdonalds is still a choose of mine when it comes to eating out. The book talked alot about what goes on in a slaughterhouse and the conditions of them. So i very strongly do not recommand this book."
"Negative","Worst ending for a book ever...: Tom, you should have kept Lecter in jail. While he was incarcerated, he was far more creepy and threatening. Once he escapes, he becomes omnipotent, and thus, far less interesting. During the course of the book, we learn that Hannibal Lecter can: read people's minds, hypnotize animals, kill anyone at anytime anywhere in the most complex way with absolutley no forethought, outwit the entire world, flasify any document no matter how complex, speak 18 languages, whip up gourmet meals made of brains, and convince Agent Starling that she's his wife. The lead-in to the last few chapters was great, and is totally ruined by the ending which seems like it was written as an afterthought. If you liked Silence of the Lambs, this book will piss you off! There's a reason why Jody Foster refused to play Clarice in the movie adaptation of Hannibal! Trust me on this one..."
"Negative","Very thorough but too dry and politically correct: This book is very comprehensive and contains a lot of useful charts and checklists, but it makes for a fairly dry read. It also is written in a very politically correct tone so you're left feeling like there's only one right way to have your baby, the authors' way. I can't recommend this book to other moms."
"Negative","Listen to the people that complain about the clicking!!: Please read other reviews and pay attention to how many talk about the drive making a clicking noise and then dying. Mine did the same thing. I thought, ""no problem, I'll call customer service!"" My guess is ALOT of people are calling customer serivice. I called 3 times. Each time as soon as I told them about the clicking it was VERY obvious they got annoyed and didn't want to talk to me anymore. PLEASE don't buy this drive! Learn from others experiances!! I'm sure a very few have won the lottery and received a drive they had no problem with. Do YOU feel lucky??"
"Positive","Good stuff: I like this record. At times it reminds me of Stereo MCs sprinked with the Verve. Its pretty powerful stuff. The weakest tune is without a doubt ""Running Battle"". I skip over it every tyime.Other than that, a good well-rounded record."
"Negative","awesome!: this band is truly awesome! my friend tom showed me them because he though the solo was good in one of the songs! WOW! im just blown away, they are like metallica combined with some heavy arse pantera. i could tell sum 41 are great influences to these crappy bands like black label society and tool. now that sum 41 have created this genre of music now they are coppying them (the bands i mentioned). well thomas thank you for introducing me to some hardcore punk."
"Positive","The Restoration is Incredible!: I watched La Grande Illusion several times, mostly on video. When I got the DVD I was amazed at how good the images were! Watch the restoration clips just to see how all the scratches that we have become accustomed to have been removed!As to the movie I think this is one of the greatest ever made. Watch how the subjects of honor, camaraderie, and humanity are treated. Watch how they all get together around meals. Nobody likes the war, and enemies understand each other: they all want it to come to an end. After that, go read the poetry of Wilfred Owen. Judging from the wars we let happen, we have certainly not learned."
"Positive","The Game of Life and How to Play It: I love this book. The ideas in it can change your life. I've already begun to teach my 3 year old that words are very powerful."
"Positive","A history of greed: The book explains what happens when faceless corporations take care of the food business. The independent producers are forced out of business, the nature is manipulated and workers are exploited.The worst aspect is that the children are one of the main target of these companies that craft their ads and products to appear attractive to youngsters.They package all their junk full of fats, chemical and unhealthy products together with little colored gadgets of famous animation characters. This makes wonders in luring the toddlers ( and their parents ).The book does a good job in describing these disgusting strategies.One section that I found very interesting was the one dedicate to flavors, complex chemicals that give actual taste to the food. They are formulated with hundreds of different compounds mixed in the right proportions to trick our mouth.Do you have an idea of what lies behind the common "" strawberry aroma "" ? Prepare yourself to be shocked."
"Negative","Absymal, ludicrous, annoying, pitiful.: First off, it's Aaron Carter, so you know this will bite big time. But come on. Talk about unrealistic! Tell me, how is a little 11-year-old white boy gonna beat 7'1"" Shaq? (I mean, sure, Shaq can't free throw - or act - or sing - to save his life, but come on.) Well, today's your lucky day, because I'm gonna tell you: he wouldn't. Shaq would just step on him. That's it. But you probably knew that already.Avoid."
"Positive","A good time in Hell.: Imagine an atheist science fiction writer dies after a dare and goes to ahell he doesn't belief in. It must be an alien abduction, and he's damnedsure going to find a way out. Such is the premise of Inferno, LarryNiven's most unusual book. A really humorous story, a man refusing tobelieve in the afterlife using science to find a way back. Probably not agood book for the overly religious. A very good read for the rest of us."
"Negative","Could use some work... a lot of work: Basically it's a boring anime that doesn't have a very interesting storyline. There is hardly any voices and its also kinda hard to follow. I think the only reason I didn't give it a 1 star is because its creepy and i like creepy stuff. If you dislike maniquines then you will be plenty scared. You will understand if you watch it. If you really want to see it, rent it first. Thats what I did and im glad that's all i did."
"Negative","JUST GIVE THIS ONE A MISS...TRUST ME.: No words can say how awful this album is. Just give it a miss.."
"Positive","Great little grinder!: I have read a few negative reviews about this grinder. I don't understand the whining. This little guy does the job just fine, is simple to operate (I don't get all of these comments about how tricky the power cord is..huh??), and the price is so low! Just buy it!"
"Negative","Just don't go there: I love have read every single one of Ms. Kenyon's DHS books and Dream Hunters. I have even gotten people to read these books because they really capture to eye and you are really there and can't put it down. I had orginially intended on buying all the League Novels. However after TRYING to read the first one...I am left more than disappointed. What a waste of Ms. Kenyon's time. The Dark Hunter Series is the best ever!!! I have read all the books at least 3 sometime 4 times a piece and ""Born of Night"" I can't even get myself past the first few chapters.Many people say ""If it isn't broke don't try to fix it."" The Dark Hunter Series is the best reading material. Anyone who have read these books would have to agree.Honestly...Aliens in Outerspace...different planets? Not Fantasy romance more like Science Fiction.I'm sorry Ms. Kenyon, but I want my Dark Hunters back!! Please"
"Negative","Do not buy: Did not come close to what his life was about...A lot of the people and incidents were made up.Very boring also."
"Negative","DONT BUY AT ALL: I purchased this Complete series for my Fiance for Christamas and the set I received was broken, I called Amazon and they sent me a second set and that also was broken, the complete plastic case the packaging was really bad I called Amazon again to complain and I have recievd 4 copies all broken, not one set was complete finally Amazon said that they could not send me another copy, becuase that means all thier copies must be broken, only refund my money, that was 2 weeks ago and I still have not recieved my refund. I will never buy from Amazon again.."
"Negative","Lousy product: I'm not referring to the movie, which was entertaining, but to the unusual fact that no inserts with pictures and information was enclosed, and the cover went apart when opening it. It was sealed in such an idiotic way, that the plasic was torn apart to remove it, thus leaving the movie cover dangling loosely. I thought I was smart ordering the movie from USA, because it was out there before in Europe, but before receiving the movie it had been released in Europe, at a cheaper price and with a much greater choice of subtitles."
"Negative","POSER-BOYS...Terrible story and Terrible acting make John...: ...a dull movie! This movie was nothing short of a collosal flop! Can anyone tell me one thing that was good about this movie? Oh yeah, the ending, that was great, you know...the part when the credits started rolling! I love that part! I had to make myself finish this movie. I can't really explain why I didn't like this movie, but something about the horrible acting and the lack of an interesting story or plot just really made me want to throw this piece of garbage where it belonged, in the garbage. I RENTED IT AND GOT RIPPED OFF!!!"
"Positive","Good guide !: Although it is not necessary to introduce once again a book that is already this well known, I can say that this ""guide"" has helped me to understand better some fundamental ideas and techniques of econometrics. It should be read before starting with the ""books"" on econometrics like Greene or Johnston. Like the title says, the book is only a guide, so further study is necessary for a completer understanding. Although the guide is compact and well written, the structure can sometimes be confusing. Because every topic is divided into an introduction, general notes and technical notes, you will have to read a little bit everywhere to get to know everythhing about a certain topic. I suggest you read through it all. I definitely recommend it to everybody who wants to study or teach econometrics."
"Positive","A real life saver for a little baby, but...: I got this bouncer for a shower gift when my son was a week old. He LOVES it now and its hard to get him to sleep in anything BUT this bouncer. It has put him to sleep when NOTHING else would and in a matter of minutes! We are real beach people (my solder son is a surfer) and this bouncer is there more then at home :)BUT, I think that once he gets older he will be bored with its lack of stimulating toys. Then again, sometimes babies get overstimulated and need to just relax, so we'll see!"
"Negative","Useless: It took me forever to get the lock to actually open, and then once I finally did unlock it, it wouldn't lock again. I would not recommend buying this unless you are okay with spending 15 minutes fiddling with it to unlock/lock it ."
"Negative","This movie doesn't have closed caption!: Amazon.com entered under product details that this movie has closed caption. They were wrong. This movie doesn't have closed caption! I was looking forward to watch it and I was disappointed when it didn't have it. So, I will borrow a book from the library instead!Updated 6/16/06I just finished the book. It's very good! It's something I wanted to read again and again for refreshment as well as reminder of the truth about Jesus. At first I was confused because Nikki in the movie is a male in the book (Nick). The movie producer must have changed the gender for better sell?"
"Negative","Poor design and manufacture: Item is of very poor design and manufacture quality.Specifically, the cap must be removed to remove the reservoir. The check valve on the reservoir leaks when you insert it into the bowl. The item needs to be cleaned frequently but the pump is directly connected to the cord so you must unplug the whole thing and cart it to the sink. The filter for the pump does not trap cat hair, what is the point? Worst of all the pump just died after 6 months and they want more $14.95 plus shipping for a replacement, that is more than 1/2 of what the whole think costs.You can find a lot better product than this, keep looking!"
"Positive","A masterwork: If you read and were deeply moved by Dr. Pierre Barbet's book on the crucifixion you absoulutley will want to read Dr. Zugibe's masterful work. He very gently but firmly shows some of the mistakes Barbet made but doesn't hesitate to give him credit for the things he was right about.Zugibe is a curious man and he investigated and discects every possible theory about Christ's death on the cross. The book is not for the faint of heart, as the earlier reivewer notes but it is an amazing scientific and yet mystical look into the horrifying suffering that a crucified man would have suffered. The chapters on the scourging and the crowing with thorns are particularly moving. I actually cried and there were times when I had to put the book down becuase it is incredibly touching. I expected the book to be cold and dry but Zugibe is a pretty good writer. He's produced a masterwork. There is not a finer book on the physical aspects of the crucifixion in print."
"Negative","Don't let the rave reviews fool you!: Like many, our family bought this book and the next based on the glowing reviews of the many readers. Unfortunately, we were in for quite a shock as these are the most unimaginative, poorly written books ever published. At Borders where I returned all four books we purchased (2 copies of Eragon and 2 of Eldest), there was a pile of returned copies of Eldest behind the counter. I was in fact unable to get a refund, instead I got store credit on a gift card.Eragon is an uninspiring story chock full of tired, overused characters. The prose is unimaginative, very wordy, and fails miserably on all levels. Each characters talks just like every other character. I don't know why everyone said this book was so good. My kids are in tears. Thanks a lot Chris Paolini for ruining our last week of summer break!"
"Positive","A Great Guide for the Mushroom Lover: I have read quite a few mushroom books in my course of book reviewing, but I would have to say this is one of the best. This book has great coverage on propagation, cultivation, identification and collecting. I like the decision to leave out mushrooms of unknown edibility because it makes the book much more manageable.The photography is excellent. I liked the addition of habitat shots of where certain mushrooms grow. This would surely help anyone who is a collector.This book stayed on track and didn't try to be all things to all people. For instance, in the cultivation section, they tell you what to read for more information depending on the type of mushroom.This book has great information on all levels and is helpful guide for the novice to expert gardener."
"Negative","not happy: To date I am having great difficulty getting this to operate. First the batteries were not good.Second, although following directions for use I cannot get it to operate it as it should. The main control will not program what I want in terms of temp. control and the unit that has the probe does not light as it should to indicate it is operating."
"Negative","Not loud enough, breaks easily: I owned TWO of these, thinking that my first purchase was just a flook when it stared shorting out. But the 2nd one did the same, and when I looked at one at a consignment store, it did the same thing, the buttons start shorting out and them rendering it useless. The other big caveat is that volume wise, there is very little decibels, which wasn't so much an issue with one child, but as we needed it to disguise other noises of more kids, it was completely ineffective. I would not recommend this product."
"Positive","easy fuel up: Its much faster and easy to fill your fuel tank and you don't end up making a mess in your rc or around it I recamend it"
"Positive","A Chemical Dependency Must Own: This small under-rated book is THE definitive book on virtually all drugs of abuse. It breaks down each of the drugs by category and by use, giving the properties of each and their derivation, and side effects including potential for addiction. Anyone interested in the chemical abuse field, or merely curious about some of the drugs they may be prescribed, will find this an exceptional buy."
"Negative","A major disappointment: Vonnegut and Adams are two of my favorite authors, and -- perhaps more importantly -- I loved Bo Fowler's other book, Scepticism, Inc. Very sadly, though, I found The Astrological Diary of God to be tough to even finish. It's too focused on masturbation, the characters are otherwise not very compelling, and the story seems to lose itself halfway through the book. That said, I highly encourage readers who like Vonnegut and similar authors to check out Scepticism, Inc. and, personally, intend to read whatever Bo Fowler publishes next."
"Negative","Check Box carefully: Ordered mine on the web, and it's been dicey since. The box was a bit battered to begin with, and upon trying to assemble the bike, found out that the reflecters were missing, and the front fork was very bent, making assembly impossible. Repeated calls to Hyper (mfg) are met with a 'full voicemail box' message."
"Positive","I like movies: As someone who likes all kinds of movies, I thought that this selection would be a worthwhile watch. It was pretty good ."
"Negative","Half are Dry: Almost half of the lens wipes that I open are dry and completely useless. I will never purchase these again."
"Positive","Above others: Thought it wa a gimmick but non stick and flips eggs easy and neat. Tried lots of differant pans, my wife (just another gimmick) so I bought it. A week later she wants the 12' and now the pots fora full set. It (they) are great"
"Positive","Just the part I needed...Thank You: I would surely order for you again, in the event I need more parts. Thanks"
"Negative","I will never look at elephants the same again: Another story line with so much potential that simply fell flat. An invasion of earth conjures up War of the Worlds or Independence Day but not ""Mars Attacks"". Making the aliens resemble elephants does not add to the story. The way in which the aliens would try to force a person into subservience, foot on chest, seemed far fetched. The space battle towards the end of the book was okay but I was left wondering how we could have developed the technology so quickly. I guess invading elephants on Para gliders will motivate you to create almost anything and quickly. The ending was anti climatic and silly but that actually fits in perfect with the overall theme of the book. Lucifer's Hammer by these two authors was an excellent read I totally enjoyed. Sadly FootFall is no Lucifer's Hammer"
"Negative","MORE OF THE SAME: AN AWKWARD NAME FOR A BAND WHO PROBABLY DOES NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXISTANCE OF GOD. MORE OF THE SAME MEANS LIKE SO MANY OF TODAYS BANDS THEY ALL SOUND ALIKE.THEY HAVE THE SAME TUNED DOWN GUITARS,THE SAME VOCALS THAT SOUND LIKE THEY GAVE THE MIC TO SOMEONES BARKING DOG AND LET HIM PROVIDE THE VOCALS. TODAYS BANDS JUST DO NOT HAVE THEIR OWN SOUND,YOU CANNOT TELL WHO IS WHO. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DAYS WHEN BANDS HAD THEIR OWN SOUND,BACK THEN YOU COULD TELL THEM APART.C.O.C DID NOT SOUND LIKE D.R.I D.R.I. DID NOT SOUND LIKE SUICIDAL,METALLICA DID NOT SOUND LIKE SLAYER,SLAYER DID NOT SOUND LIKE ANTHRAX,ANTHRAX DID NOT SOUND LIKE TESTAMENT.YOU GET THE PICTURE, MORE OF THE SAME MINDLESS GARBAGE."
"Negative","Flimsy construction: Bought this product for my 70-pound Boxer. I set it up and he loved it! However, within a month of daily use, the joints started to bend. After 6 weeks, it was completely broken. The joints bend easily, despite this being sold as a bed for ""large breed"" dogs. I actually bought two of these beds - one lasted for about 2 months before falling apart, the other lasted about two weeks."
"Positive","Essentials of Sociology - great book!: The book is written very well and is filled with tons of information! The numerous real world stories within each chapter help readers see the concepts in sociology the textbook introduces applied to the real world, and the stories are incredibly interesting. Recommended for anyone who is interested in studying sociology."
"Positive","A Good Game...but not a lot to do: This game is pretty fun. You can pick your rider's clothes and hair and your horse's coat, mane, saddle and pad. You can also name the rider and horse.You can ride in the practice corral (which is totally easy and you can be a pro once you play it a few times), ride in a pasture (this is not quite so easy, you have to finish the courses within a few seconds. I'm not even past the second one yet!) Then you can ride in a competition. In the practice corral and pasture, there are arrows in the ground to follow, and in the competition there aren't any arrows, but there's a path that you follow and it's very easy--easy enough that the first few competitions I was in I won first and second place. The pictures and awards you got you can view them in the Scrapbook and print them out. There isn't a lot to do, but still I find this game fun."
"Negative","TWO 11/16...NO 3/4: Stanley 11 pc. deep 1/2 drive impact sockets. Contained two 11/16 and no 3/4. The duplicate socket is a Husky not Stanley. Looks like Stanley dumps their mistakes on Amazon. To much trouble to return...I'll look for a 3/4 at the flea market. Should have looked there first."
"Negative","DO NOT BUY: Its a straight forward device.Unfortunately what I got was nothing like what I ordered.What arrived was a mustard yellow coupling about twice the size of the one pictured, that is so far off spec the cables fall out at the slightest movement.I ended up folding paper wedges to keep it together while I was working and then had to stop by R**** Shack to buy a proper one at quadruple the price so I could continue using it on the road.It should have been a straight forward purchase and I thought with Prime shipping I would save myself the trouble of running the errand.I guess they just prey on people who buy devices that aren't priced high enough to justify a return.meh..."
"Positive","An inspiraion to be YOURSELF...: In this debut album, Pink not only displays wonderful Pop/R&B grooves, but strongly encourages individuality, and not to try so hard to ""fit it."" She certainly is one lady with attitude and edge!Pink jumps from funky dance tracks like ""You Make Me Sick"" and ""Most Girls"" to slow, strong vocal songs such as ""Stop Falling"" and ""You Oughta Know."" Pink is a very talented lady not only when it comes to vocals, but she's an excellent dancer and performer."
"Positive","Great: Recieved DVD and watched.Blast: Live. My (sober) verdict: If you don't have an emotional response with the hairs standing up: your dead, deaf or your sound systems in bad shape. None of the POed cat sound of the traditional dirges."
"Negative","More of the Same: This book could not be more predictible, or less informed. It is the same old ahistorical modernist rant: market capitalism destroyed real community, real meaning and, for that matter, reality iself. Whatever you make of its politics, or its lack of originality, the most damning criticism is that it exhibits a visible lack of contact with the anthropological or material culture record. It makes no meaningful contact with social history. But, being careful really doesn't matter much when you are on the side of the angels: beating up on McDonald's and modernity usually requires little more than the will to do so."
"Negative","One of the worst movies ever made. Definetly a must see!: This movie was produced and starred in by Fred Williamson. If you ever saw Dusk Till Dawn and wondered where did they get that character this is the movie to get.It's super cheesy, was meant to be seriouse and that makes it funnier than you can imagine. Get it at any cost!"
"Positive","Great looks!: These cute salt and pepper shakers are cute and handy by my stove. I havn't had any problem with the salt getting wet."
"Negative","Toxic Cinderella Glass Slippers: If you can smell the chemicals being emitted by these slippers than your child is breathing them in! Also the chemicals are being absorbed through the skin of your childs feet. They are made with known cancer causing chemicals. They are also manufactured over seas wher the DEQ,EPA etc; have no jurisdiction over the processes used to manufacture these slippers. My two year old daughter was given a pair and they are now hidden in the garage. Did not want to put them into a land fill until some one has analyzed the toxic emission from these horrible smeling slippers. Benzene, Poly Vinyl Chloride, all kill the liver."
"Positive","Awesome, Fun DVD: This workout is fantastic. It goes by really quickly and is enjoyable to do. I had fun doing it and couldn't believe how sore I was the next day."
"Negative","Worthless: Don't waist your money ... when I bought this item there were no reviews. Hope you would pay attention."
"Negative","God Save Us.: Stephenie Meyer is perhaps the worst writer who's ever been published. And that's about all the time I can spare on a travesty of literature unprecedented in all of history."
"Positive","Nice set of features with only one small wish and a small annoyance.: Uniden has done a good job with this phone. I like it very much with only one small wish: I wish it had a headset port and the ability to take it ""off-the-hook"" without actually lifting the handset.I had been looking for a decent analog phone to replace my broken Contel that I wasn't happy with before it broke. After researching the available phones and based upon past experience with Uniden products (we own a couple of their 900MHz DSS phones for the house) I decided to go with this model. I have not been disappointed.Now, to the annoyance: The ringer on both the included cordless and the base unit is not loud enough. Some nice tunes, but none of them really loud enough to be heard when asleep. As I used to be on-call quite a bit, this was an important feature. Now, I need it louder so calls from friends and family when I'm sleeping in on Sunday morning wake me up so I can answer."
"Positive","RAZAC HAIR OIL: This is a fine product that allows one's hair to glow. However, the container does not get back to it's original shape once it's squeezed."
"Positive","Just what I needed: I like to use glass jars for just about everything and these half gallon ones come in handy when you need more room than you have in the quart jar. The shipping costed more than the jars themselves, nearly twice as much, which I did not like, but they are glass and glass does break so I suppose I should have expected that. Would recommend them."
"Positive","Fun toys: Exactly what we expected them to be. Our son is learning to dive and swim under water, so these are fun ways for him to learn. All the kids are enjoying this toy in the pool. Idiots like myself should keep the directions on how to store them, it took us a while!"
"Negative","A drepressing slum of a book: I found myself skimming over pages of description who's only purpose was to add to the word count of the book. Having pushed through the whole thing, I find it of little use. Not particularly entertaining, just wallowing in the depths of the worst images the author could come up with."
"Positive","Light and functional: This blade is quite light and is of quality construction. I find myself choosing it to carry most of the time during the work week for these reasons alone. Sharpens well and retains edge. I also like the fact that it is far less visually threatening than many of my other knives upon presentation. This is a concern in my workplace, but not in public (where I generally cary a more substantial EDC knife). In all I would reccomend this knife as a gentleman's folder or a more classy choice for sensitive work or social environments."
"Negative","Horrible: I first brought this cd player yesterday I was a bit dissapointed with the features, and the LCD display. It worked the first day, but the second day all it started saying was READ ERROR, and it doesnt do anything else but that, I think Rio Cd players should be Recalled, before i brought this everyone that recently owned one told me they [foul up] as soon as you take it out of the package! so i decided to buy it at the store..., so i could take it right back if something went wrong, and ofcourse like everyone told me, it [stopped working] for NO reason at all, you could keep this thing in a nice cushioned box, and treat it perfectly and yet it STILL will break. it is ashamed that they sell things like that for that type of price..."
"Negative","Very Disappointed: Mr. C has marbles in his mouth. This CD wouild have been a lot better if it came with dance instructions."
"Positive","The Crow, The way it was intended to be.: In this fantastic novelization of James O'Barr's, dark avenger, an author, is murdered, and brought back to seek revenge on his killers. No his name isn't Eric Draven, its William Blessing.Blessing is brutally slaughtered by his ""best"" friend, and his wife, is savagly raped.Blessings Edgar Allan Poe obsession, is facinating, and what happens to Marquette at the end, makes you think."
"Negative","Horrible customer service and product: received battery From Longlast battery, replaced, it worked but overheated ipod and charge didn't last as long as replaced battery. Sent it back as defective, they received it, and actually emailed that they received it and said they were mailing out new one, and it NEVER showed up. They don't answer emails or phone calls! Horrible horrible customer service. DO NOT BUY, if you have trouble with the product, forget it. And forget it if they claim a lifetime warrantee on products, they won't come through for you."
"Positive","They are great and can't be found anywhere else.: They last a long time and very helpful in various receipts. I use them in brownies, which makes them more moist and chewy."
"Positive","Koontz goes Christmas!: Okay, here's the deal: Santa's got a twin brother. Only Santa's twin isn't nearly so nice--he hogties Santa and leaves him in a dingy dungeon, then steals the sleigh--threatening the reindeer--and spreads Christmas horror throughout the world. It's up to two young sisters, Emmy and Charlotte, to stop him, rescue the real Santa Claus, and restore happiness to the world...before dawn.Fully of wit and humor people of all ages will enjoy, Dean Koontz's ""Santa's Twin"", featuring superb illustrations by Phil Parks, is a must-have for holiday fans. Enjoyable rhyme, hidden snowmen in every picture, and little bits of humor drawn into the pictures themselves will delight Koontz fans and casual readers. ""Santa's Twin"" may not ever become a holiday classic, but it's certainly a holiday tradition around my house!"
"Positive","overlooked revenge movie: At first I found this film hard to get into, it seemed cliched and quite frankly I am sick to death of the latest film concept that every economically depressed eastern European town has to have a huge nightclub that stays packed even on tuesday mornings at 3AM. Doesn't anybody have to do farmwork? However, once the story arced in the last third it became very much worth it. Seeing Thora Birch get in touch with her inner Camille Keaton (look it up, you'll thank me later) while at the same time doing most of her own stunts had me on the edge of my seat!! Further evidence that direct-to-video is the new grindhouse. A quality film that has nothing to do with its original concept as a remake of Terror Train."
"Negative","Cute cover! But lacking: I've been given this book as a gift on three different occasions, probably because it's such a cute little book about something seemingly impossible to mess up - cupcakes! But the author of this book somehow managed to do it.You'll notice when you make the first batch that the batter comes out more like brownie batter than cake batter, which I thought was strange, but not necessarily bad. Then cupcakes literally came out like cornmeal muffins you'd make from a mix - DRY AND CRUMBLY. I tried a few other recipes just to make sure that wasn't one that had a typo in it and, no, all the cupcakes this book's recipes produces are dry, dry, dry.Don't fall for the cute packaging."
"Negative","shrug: I got about three quarters through the book and just couldn't go any further. How did this get rave reviews? It is simply awful. There is so much shrugging going on that it's amazing anyone got anything done. I began to think that maybe the water was contaminated and was causing all this involuntary shrugging. And his characters shrugged at the most gawd awful inappropriate times. Shrugging is usually used to show complacence, but they would react to the most DIRE situations with a simple shrug. Not just the hero, but EVERY PERSON in the book SHRUGGED. And aside from all that, the story was thin, thin, thin. And frankly, boring."
"Positive","Initial experience: Installation on a Stihl FS90R was a bit of a nuisance. The instructions didn't include my trimmer. So itrequired a call to Grass Gator technical support. I was told to ream out the hole on the Grass Gator in orderto slide it over the splines below the threads. After using a rat tail file for a 20 minutes it slipped over.It seems that using washers or a solid spacer to cover the splines might have been both a quicker and lessaggressive/destructive approach. It felt a bit uncomfortable to file away the plastic that I just purchased.On the plus side it took down thick stalky weeks like a hot knife through butter. And I didn't have replacestrings every few minutes."
"Positive","My favorite: This is one of the best flavors of the International Coffees. I'm very disappointed they have discontinued this flavor. Why do they always get rid of the better products????"
"Positive","a great simple product: I purchased this product a few months ago and have been extremely happy with it since. Everything works as advertised right out of the box. The only problems I have experienced are related to dropped connections by my ISP or DSL modem, not the actual router (although it appears some folks believe it is actually the router's fault, but in my case that has been the wrong assumption every time). The print server works flawlessly with my older laser printer and speeds between my workstation and laptop are excellent. I can use my laptop anywhere on my 1/4 acre property and 2000 sq. foot home and get at least a 'GOOD' connection which far away exceeds my DSL speeds anyway. Additionally, I found the help manual from D-Link was very good and easy to read. I highly recommend this product for anyone like me who is new to the wireless/home networking world."
"Negative","Nothing Super About This Watch: Nice looks and functions but due to the shape and button placement, the watch often changes functions from simple hand movements and that's a problem when I'm timing a run. The alarm bell isn't loud enough to wake me up even if I'm wearing the watch. The little bump at the end of the band can make it a hassle to take off the watch."
"Negative","Why does everyone love this game?: I got persuaded into buying this game by the irresistable monkey characters, but soon found myself playing one of the most frustrating games of 2002. I personally own 14 game systems, and easily over 1,000 games, and this game can't hang with any of them. Yeah, it's fun for about an hour, but lets face it: The game is designed for people that like to be repeatedly killed, often by powers that they can't control. The later levels mostly rely on luck, partially due to the camera (which you can't control or rotate around the monkey). The graphics look like they were designed for the N64, and the ""story"" feels tacked on and has nothing to do with the game. Many people talk about how great the mini-games are, but they are much less sophisticated than those in Mario Party (and also are fewer in number). I just think Sega can do better."
"Positive","Good Value: I purchased this toaster for a friend. It is functional, and fits her kitchen decor perfectly. This is certainly a good toaster for the money. I would give it 5 stars if the slots were a bit wider and the holder was a bit higher. I have to reach into the toaster to retreive english muffins when they are done toasting. Ouch!"
"Positive","Wow!: The best new artist to appear in a long time. I tend to buy older stuff, because most new music is so bad. But Kasey gets more than her share of playing time with this great record. Great voice, great tunes. BUY it now!!! Best CD of the year (and the decade?)"
"Positive","Great soap!: I really enjoy the soap. The smell, the feel of the suds, and the freshness after using it. The only problem is that is the coloring or dye, (I assume is natural), discolors my washcloth when I rub it on the cloth. A little disconcerting the first time that this happens, but I still rate the soap highly since it is mild and does a great job on my skin. I have very sensitive skin and this soap is good. Happy face!"
"Negative","pure ""ear diarreah"": These guys make Michael Bolton sound like Mozart. Some type of operatic pop cheese hybrid. I can see these guys covering Britney Spears horrid catalog ""opera-style"" someday. Hopefully, the appocalypse will happen first!"
"Negative","Don't buy it!: I own three of these worthless machines. I bought one for light use at my office, and it worked fine so I bought 2 more for my home. The two I bought for home worked for 6 months and now you can't print any more. It just jams the paper and gives you ""errors"". Heed the other reviews and stay away from this product."
"Negative","Mine snapped too!: Similar to the other reviewer, my knife snapped in two pieces, on the blade, just above the handle, while cutting a red potato. This knife has a ""lifetime warranty"" so we'll see if JA Henckels comes through. This is a good-looking, well-balanced knife. But it seems like it shouldn't have snapped, even after 5-years of use."
"Positive","From a Ballet Teacher!: I have many technique books that are on the market,and this book tops them all! Most ballet teaching books relate to little kids only, well, this book grows with the student. What I mean is its not sugar coated with pictures of little kids dressed in pink tutus. It shows a real ballerina deminstraiting technique.I like this book,and recomend it to you as well as my students.Kim's school of dance."
"Negative","Cardboard Movie: Disappointing, Pathetic.: A sad sad attempt at low-budget box office success gone horribly wrong. Everything campy and fun from the ""good"" ones is lost to the dull story choices, uninspired acting, and confusing unspoken communications between Edward and Bella.If I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have had a clue! I have read the book, however, and I highly recommend you do the same. Run FAR FAR away from this movie and read the book. You'll have time to savor it, engaging and enticing you to read more-- while unfortunately, this movie is bound to repel you from the entire series."
"Negative","Hated it.: The first 97% of the movie was all right, but when they wrapped it up real quick at the end with ""a satanic cult did it all"" that ruined it for me. I imagine that real and true demonic possession occurs more often than ""satanic cults"" do. And I don't believe in possession.Throwing in a satanic cult is as bad as ending something with ""and then they woke up and it was all a dream""."
"Negative","Stuck on alarm mode.: After about 2 weeks of use the watch got stuck on alarm mode, emitting a high pitched alarm warning that no amount of button pressing would get rid of. Very disappointed in this product."
"Negative","TO BIG: These Tablets are way to big. I am a big fan of Optimum. But this time they got it wrong. I almost choked trying to get these things down....Try there other products such as there protein powder is awesome...."
"Positive","I'm not totally satisfied: It looks good but all the time the power cards come out and falls down.And also some time remote doesn't work. With that price its ok."
"Negative","pretty pictures,pretty poor info: I looked forward to this book giving me the info I needed for planning my short port stops in the 3 Alaskan towns that I will be visiting. It doesn't take into consideration port times and misses Haines altogether. When they note a restaurant stop, there is no information about it. The pictures give you an idea of what photos to take or postcards to buy butI don't think that I will even pack it."
"Negative","blank DVDs?: I should have rented this before I bought it. The flip side of my DVDs don't work. The menu claims they contain bonus features but they seem to be blank."
"Negative","empty calories...: A shallow narravtive exercise bundled as a deep, dark mystery. No chararacter rises beyond the level of the cartoon-like. The plot is as pointless as it is breathless, hung upon a factual skeleton cribbed from the encyclopedia. Not to mention the howlingly awful theologizing, sure to appeal to both popular disdain and utter innocence of same. Read something else."
"Negative","Chickenhawk's unite...: Currently this idiot is screaming into a megaphone down in Crawford at Cindy Sheehan's supporters. All's I can say is what goes around comes around...looking forward to it. And I laaaaaaugh at any of you who actually spent money on this book. Welcome to the Chickenhawk army."
"Positive","Bun B shows why he is an Underground King: Bun B relfects on the fact that he and Pimp C are the Underground Kings with an album that gives us a look at his southern heritage and smooth effortless flow. He compilates his album with some of the hottest rappers in the game but is not overshadowed. This album mirrors his wisdom and experience as an MC, and is a testament to his legacy as one of the most influencial rappers in the South. Some of the hottest joints on this album, for the readers are That's Gangsta, Damn I'm Cold, You're Everything, and If I Die II Night. These tracks are a contrast of his mainstream sound and Bun B's ability to go deeper into his craft. Hope you enjoy these tracks as much as I did."
"Negative","Nothing special: This really isn't anything extraordinary. The fact that their single, Right Now, and Politically Correct, are the first songs on the record make you think it's going to be good, but the music fizzles after that. It's good background music for doing homework or falling asleep, but that can be said about other albums that are more worth the money. In short, I found the CD rather boring, though the first two songs are borderline awesome."
"Negative","This product I awful: I purchased this memory foam as a gift but It never inflated. Even after waiting for weeks it did not expand. It looks awful and it cannot be slept on. I'm extremely unhappy with the product. I thought I was getting a good product. I was misled. Do not purchase this item. BUYER BEWARE!!"
"Negative","NO MORE RASPBERRY FLAVOR IN Celestial Seasons Raspberry Gardens: I am a long time lover of Celestial Seasons tea, and loved Raspberry Gardens Green Tea until this shipment. They changed the formula of this tea and their other fruit flavored green tea to taste more like green tea. Doesn't make sense to me, the reason people buy flavored teas is for the flavor. I love the benefits of green tea but not so crazy about the flavor so I tried and purchased several green tea brands and flavors. I spoke with Celestial Seasons and they decided to change the blend to make it more of a green tea flavor. If that is what we want we would just purchase their green tea with no flavor blends. Very disappointing."
"Positive","DH Mossie: Excellent book for the Mossie fancier, even better for the scale modeller. Fantastic view of various stages of construction, great number of revealing photos, and beyond that a good read."
"Negative","absolute filth: this is the sign of the apocolypse. this cd is unbelievbly bad. this band and thier fans should be slaughtered. look at the lyrics. people like this deserve to be killed and put into hell. every one of the songs about having sex with dead children. absolutley disgusting."
"Negative","Online disclosure of system requirements insufficient: I purchased this external hard drive so that I could back up data from an older computer before purchasing my new computer. Unfortunately, the online advertising is only ""it's as easy as plug it in and go"" and makes no mention of the minimal system requirements. Same thing for the directions. It's just the fine print on the box, but of course I had opened everything. A major disappointment."
"Positive","Lark Rise: Anyone who buys the Lark Rise to Candleford Series needs to know if you buy it in the download form it is missing scenes. I have watched both the download for and DVD form and found out there are many scenes missing. They are still good but not as good as buying the DVDS themselves."
"Negative","This is a 1-star rating because you can't give zero.: I wish I had read the online reviews of this book rather than just the jacket cover. I thought I was buying a historical romance with an ambitious heroine who was passionate about her home. What I bought was a historical novel with an amoral heroine who becomes involved in a graphically described sister-brother incestous relationship. I'm so glad that I read the other reviews on Amazon and learned that the incest plot continues throughout the book. That's all I needed to know; 100 pages and I'm done. And I'll make sure not to buy another Philippa Gregory book."
"Positive","disappointed that i saw the movie before reading the book: i saw the movie like a year ago and it became one of my favorite ever since. i didn't figure out that it was a book until a couple months ago (yeah, im stupid) and i wasn't at all disappointed with the book. i did enjoy it, but there were parts in the movie that i thought were hilarious and became attached to (i guess you could say that) but then they werent in the book. they werent necessary parts, so i guess it didnt matter. another thing is that i saw the movie and only viewed it as good entertainment whereas the book i think has some meaning but i didnt catch it cuz i was just trying to be entertained and had it set in my mind that it was just supposed to be funny. still...i recommend reading the book and seeing the movie (in that order) they were both well worth my time."
"Negative","just dreadful: This book is so awful that it would not have been published if the author wasn't Alice Walker. So much drival and meaningless reflection."
"Positive","Silly but delightful action/comedy: I enjoyed Loose Cannons. Yes, the plot is somewhat cliched--Nazis are the bad guys who must be stopped and the good local cops battle the bureaucrats at the FBI. But Dan Ackroyd, Gene Hackman, and Dom de Luise make it worth watching. Ackroyd is terrific as the brilliant but mentally disturbed detective, Hackman as the straight shooter, and De Luise as the sleazy but good hearted target ofthe bad guys. Nancy Travis is also pretty good as an attractive Mossad agent. It's fun and enjoyable, and what else do you really want from a movie?"
"Negative","hatchet job: The House of Cards is brilliant. What a shame some inept editor cut out many of the best parts in this version. For what? Are you in a hurry when you're watching great performances? GIVE US THE WHOLE THING!"
"Negative","Gangster movie with out the flair: Coudn't think of one redemening factor about this film just plain killing, the story is set around a robbery that goes wrong. Interesting ending."
"Negative","ABSOLUTLY HORRIBLE: I am now compleatly bald from trying to use this product, if you have the 2003 version KEEP IT. Thease tech support people are brain dead. This new version is so parinoid about unlicenced copys floating around that even if you pay for it it still treats you like you stole it."
"Positive","Amazing: This is one album that they really did let God have his way with. From the beginning till the end the album is very energetic and you can tell that they know who they are talking about. Each song is good but New Direction, This is the Day, Heal the land,I'm in Love With Jesus,Hands Up,I Can Make It,and I'm Ready are excellent songs for a youth or young adult choir. Have Your Way is also an excellent song for a praise team to sing because it just ushers in God's presence. This is one album that will not disappoint you and also it is worth the money."
"Negative","AT LEAST I DIDNT PAY FULL PRICE: I got this dvd thinking it would be the best of justin and christina ...and it was like 4 boring mmc shows and xtina britney and justin wernt even in any of them really lol WASTE of my time and money....ONLY HARDCORE fans should get this dvd"
"Negative","Sex on stage: Why oh why must I watch sex on stage? It was not at all fun to watch this ballet and although the technique was gorgoeus and the lifts superb, the explicit sex acts were too much to bear. If this were a movie it would be rated NC-17. What about art makes it suddenly appropriate? The product was excellent, but the ballet...not so much."
"Negative","extreme skinny bitch: ok. So first off their advice about vices is good and delivered with humor. And the advise about sugar and carbs is right on the money but then they start talking about dairy and meat. I was on board until then. This book is basically a beginners guide to veganism with allot of bad words. ALLOT."
"Negative","piece of junk: batteries are terrible. burned them out in one month. they sent new ones. burned those up the next season. thing lasted 13 months and it is worth less now. had 2 batteries also...."
"Negative","In ""Sea Change"" Beck is floundering: This is Beck's lowest point as a lyric writer and musician.It's clear that the music and tone is about a failed relationship. Beck should have been able to mine this period of his life for some depth like many musicians before him but he can only cough up cliches like ""you're dead to me now"".Beck as a confessional singer/songwriter doesn't cut it. Compare this music to someone like Suzanne Vega's ""Songs in Red and Gray"" from last year which created great poetry out of her failed marriage. Compare this music to early Neil Young, whose song's like ""Heart of Gold"" or ""Don't let it Bring you Down"" cover the same region of the heart.Perhaps in time he may be able to pull some depth out of his private pain, but in this cd he tries for the spirt of Dylan and ends up sounding like Gordon Lightfoot."
"Negative","Cisco CCIE Lab Practice Kit: I found this book to be a good reference for the basics of the CCIE Lab. It provided a good foundation, however, it fell short of being a good preparation tool for the actual Lab. The book does not address the new 1-day format of the Lab Exam very well, and I felt that the book did not cover the internetworking technologies to the difficulty levels of the actual Lab exam.I would recommend this book as a beginning to serious Lab Exam preparation, but you will soon find that you need to progress beyond the scope of this book."
"Negative","Did you forget America?: When are we going to take a good look at ourselves? If you believe that Reagan's weapons give-away was an isolated incident think again! Just like a shoplifter - for every 1 that is caught there are 100s more that aren't. We not only have a history of giving away weapons we also have a history of training those who would do us harm - Osama Bin Laden was one of our prized students!!We are in every way more destructive to ourselves than our greatest enemies could ever be."
"Negative","Good Beginning: I liked the beginning of the book, but then i just got bored once all the characters found eachother. Who knows if i'll ever finish it. At least it was free."
"Positive","excellent: ian paice,the backbone for my kinda rock..as i do share the same profession,though am a Maldivian,touring around Maldives..passed 25 pleasant years of performing rock..still i do keep an eye on him..."
"Positive","Book Review: This is a book that a colleague of mine purchased. I immediately purchased a copy after reading the simple and straight forward way in which problem solving is handled. I am using the text to teach my Grade 10 students problem solving."
"Positive","A great gem to dig: This is one of those great books that no one has ever heard about, but which ends up being one of the best books ever written. Lovers of Fantasy fiction will find Blood of the Ancients such a wonderful read that they'll thank themselves for getting up the nerve to buy it.I don't want to give away too much of the story, but I will say that the characters are wonderfully written, the pacing is deliciously fast, and it's part one of a nine-book series!True adventurers won't be disappointed."
"Positive","Wagan 10.5 Liter Fridge: As delivered the power cord for the Fridge became very warm on the point of melting the plastic insulation. Contacted Wagan Cusstomer Service who reconized that there was a problem and sent a new power cord. Using the new cord the Fridge performed as expected and we are very happy with the product. Wagan provided excellent response."
"Negative","Disappointing: The questions in the game are too easy and the game play is not very interesting. I think this game would be a good value for [money] but not at almost [money]."
"Positive","Simply the converter: Before this cd was recomended to me, I enjoyed the likes of Elton John, Whitney, Mariha, Presley, people like that. Too many to mention. Maybe i'm easy pleased, i don't know. But if I am, then i'm in the majority. Opera was taboo, but not now. This cd is a wake eup call for me, and I have spread the wealth and been thanked. If, as many critics say, this woman is weak, then what a treat awaits me because I love this album, and can't wait to be subject to more of the same, if not better . The duets are just incredible, I love Cura, Bocelli, and have invested in thier albums and videos already. But Brightman does it for me. Boy does she have a set of lungs on her. She has a great voice, and I am in the process of buying everything she has ever done. I urge all to give this album a go. It will alter your taste in music forever. If I was Siskel And Ebert, I would give it two very enthuasiastic thumbs up. Buy Buy Buy."
"Negative","Regalo Bed rail: Manual is written poorly with too many steps that do not showthe best way to position pieces to put the rail together properly.One of the spring locking pegs on the side rails was broken and would not click into place after I put to bar pieces together. The release mechanism to lowerthe gate is poorly designed and not very sturdy physically. Pullingout the spring loaded pins is difficult and putting them backafter raising the gate is even more difficult. I would avoid gettingthis item if I had to purchase it again.Regalo Hide Away Exrta Long Bed Rail - White"
"Negative","A lesser Fraser: The Reavers is not up to the author's Flashman series -- but, then, what can be. He mixes modern sensabilities in a 17th century setting and too numerous authorial asides that impede the otherwise galloping narrative."
"Positive","survived washing machine: I lost this and have been looking for it for over a month. Then I washed some of my cargos and when I pulled them out I saw it lying, CAP OFF, (I found the cap weeks ago) in the bottom of the washing machine. ARGHHHHH....I thought, there is no way this things works, all my files will be ruined. NOPE. Popped this baby into the laptop and she works perfectly! Opened several files to make sure. Another plus is when you do have the cap on, heh heh, it fits snugly."
"Positive","Idiot girl from the get-go: I'm so glad I take my lunch breaks alone. I snorted, cried (from laughing), and pounded on the outdoor picnic table continuously reading this book. My favorite story has to be Laurie making 'Sims' of her and her husband.....sounds exactly like something I would do, among her other stories. I adore this silly, silly woman!!"
"Positive","An eye opener...: for people who don't pay enough attention to what's happening in America. Well written and highly recommended by a man who has been there and knows full well how Washington works."
"Positive","Hauntingly Beautiful: The minute the movie ended my wife and I went to Border's Books to buy the soundtrack, but they were SOLD OUT! This is one of the most hauntingly beautiful, harmonious enhancements to a film that I've heard in quite a while. A wonderful addition to anyone's collection. Please, please academy voters, do not overlook this masterpiece."
"Negative","Rancid meet The Exploited: Gone are The Clash influences, only to be replaced by a heavy dose of The Exploited. While ""Life Won't Wait"" pushed the ska experimentation of ""Wolves"" perhaps too far, this latest release abandons their ska influences for the noisy guitars and mumbled screaming of early 80's British punk. Only they don't do it as well.The album is obviously a purposeful shift from their previous sound, as if the band is out to disprove the unfair criticism that they are just Clash wannabes. Unfortunately, rather than continuing to develop their own unique sound, Rancid has instead settled for the time weary crunch of melodyless punk."
"Negative","Don't waste your money!!!: We bought one thinking this would be the answer to all our pancake-making woes....boy, were we wrong!!! The darn thing didn't open & close worth a poop, and the hinge snapped in two after just the second use!! NOT worth even a clearance price!!"
"Negative","Overpowering Hiss: Bought this for wife so volume on TV can be turned down. Some of the reviews referred to a ""hiss"", but the majority rated it okay - so I bought it. Was a mistake. The hiss is so overpowering you can barely make out anything. Switched settings, etc., no luck. Will be ruturning - hope get refund."
"Positive","Has to be read to be disbelieved.: You know that ""truth is stranger than fiction"" because fiction is limited by our imagination. Here, author Epstein, provides a captivating biography of Armand Hammer - a con's con. Hammer pulled ""all the stops"" in a brazen existence of deception that is way beyond what can be imagined by all but the most cunning connivers. Crossing even blood and family members, Epstein's true chronicle of Hammer far surpasses anything of the mass media fictional yarns or true, related stories of the same ilk. Exceptionally well-written and very difficult to put down: most readers will find Hammer's m.o. incredulous and not being able to wait to see what happens next. In short, a great biography and required reading for sensitizing to business hypocrisy."
"Positive","Visualize: I liked how this book gave many detailed graphs to help explain the concepts. My only complaint so far is how it vaguely explained to apply the Divergence theorem and then gave a pretty ambiguous picture that was pretty worthless to understanding what exactly it applied to."
"Positive","Tub Size: The one piece of information that I really wanted to know when I was looking at buying this and was not displayed here was the size of these tubs, so here it is:8"" Height13 5/8"" Width24"" Length20 3/4 X 10 1/8"" Bottom DiameterNot as big as you might think. I used it to hold beer for a party and was able to put about four 12 packs in one, with a minimum about of ice. Three cases fit better with a descent amount of ice. I would say the price was pretty good since it included shipping."
"Positive","Bought it Reconditioned: Disclaimer ***the only connection I have with Dyson is that I bought their vacuum***I bought the Dyson reconditioned from Amazon last week and I am really happy with it. The suction is amazing - I have old apartment carpeting that was practically flat and it brought up the nap quite a bit. The only complaints (minor) that I have are that it heats up a room very quickly (it's 100 degrees here in CA); and the attachment wand is awkward to use.Other than that, it's a million times better than my Sharp Twin Energy which it replaced, or the Dirt Devil 12 amp I had. Especially with two cats with lots of hair.I'd definitely recommend it."
"Positive","GREAT PRODUCT: I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND WHO HAS NOT SET IT DOWNWHEN HE HAS TIME TO USE IT AND LEARN W/IT.WE ALSO PURCHASED GARMIN UNITED STATES TOPO MAPSOURCE,WE ENCOUNTERED THAT W/ NEW LAPTOPS THEY ARE DOING AWAY W/SERIAL PARELLEL PORT,SO GARMIN SHOULD CONSIDER OPTIONSFOR USB PORTS ALSO. WE DID FIND AN ADAPTER..LIKES BATTERIES ....SO CONSIDER RECHARGABLE ."
"Positive","More Plans Please: The reason I purchased this book is to get a wide variation of plans to choose from. Though the book goes to great lengths about the history and origin of many benches it only gives plans on about four. On a positive note, the author does give us a tremendous amount of information that we can tailor to our own needs."
"Negative","Gets old quick...: I was quite dissapointed in this book. The themes, and indeed the entire manner of writing in this collection of stories is repetative and stale. The details change from story to story, but nothing else. Many of the author's other works (namely the ""unknow error of our lives"") seem to follow suit. It would have been nice to have encountered some variety, whether it be in character perspective, the unraveling of the plot, or simply in style. If you are considering this book, I would suggest that there are other books with similar themes, but much more well written"
"Negative","TERRIBLE AS USUAL: Kathy Griffin is a terrible comedian. This sucked, as most of her stuff does. I don't know why I even watched it."
"Negative","Pure Crap: This is one of the worst things I've read in a long, long time. The characters are one dimensional (if that), the plot contrived, the writing style amateurish (Whitcomb's idea of describing a person, for example, is to simply 'name drop' a string of designer labels - and he does this over and over).The conclusion, which because the book ended is what I must call it, felt like the end of a really bad comic book, and does nothing more than set the stage for what I must suppose is a whole series of 'superhero spy' books.I'll pass, thanks. Fool me once ..."
"Negative","If it weren't for the wealth of knowledge...: this video wouldn't be worh it...as the production/image quality is so 1980'sish, that you can't belive that twenty years later Wayne is still selling this video. If I had three wishes, 1) I would wish for a dramatic price reduction in this video 2) I would wish Wayne to produce a new set of videos with all digital equipment & footage. 3) Sell it at the price we're paying for this current video."
"Negative","My discussions with Truman contradict much of this book: Harry did not want to be President and was not tied to corrupt political influences as President. This book misses the essence of Harry Truman badly. I suggest reading Harry's own books to understand Harry, at least this author knew Harry intimately."
"Positive","funny movie but not the greatest plot: Safe Men is a funny movie with a different style of humor than what you see in every other movie today.Sam,Eddy, and Veal Chop are all hillarious characters with some pretty good quotes. If the plot was a little more catchy this would be a five star movie"
"Positive","Great 80's Classic: I just received this movie the other day. About the DVD itself the top cover says that it is widescreen when it is not. It is full screen. The video looks great but the audio is a bit distorted. Other than those small things I am so glad this movie came out on DVD."
"Negative","thay made it to be a better game than it is: Wreckless has a good idea but the poor story and that fact that you do the same thing everytime makes it only a two day rentel (that is if you realy want to throw away your money). Wreckless also makes me remmber Blood Wake (by the way, blood wake is just like this game but ur in a boat shooting a gun). dont get me wrong they hade a good idea with the game, just make it a little more interesting and not the same thing every level"
"Negative","Wrong hardware / aweful customer response by company: I was so happy to order this. It hasn't even been put together yet... in box for two weeks. They sent the wrong hardware with it. I emailed them 2 times and got no response. After twenty minutes of trying I finally got a human voice. She was nice and shipped the parts. They arrived today and guess what? The same wrong parts again. I can't get a response so I guess I will have to also go and purchase the stuff to put it together. At least I have a list from the owner's manual. Overall experience was a big fat bust."
"Negative","Poor choice if you want an FBI career: I agree with ""sackrtaters"" review 100 percent that Douglas' book is a big disappointment. Not only is it geared exclusively to special agent careers, it doesn't provide much useful information and discussion on the hiring process is out of date. ""FBI Careers,"" by Thomas H. Ackerman, is up to date and MUCH more in-depth. It covers special agent careers and the hiring process at length, and also includes info on about 20 other FBI positions and their application processes. Ackerman's book also has great advice on filling out application forms, taking the exams, and passing the interviews. I also recommend ""The FBI: A Comprehensive Reference Guide,"" by Athan Theoharis, for a great overview of the agency and its functions. The Theoharis book is an excellent reference for info on the history and organization of the FBI."
"Positive","Nice toning video: I like this one. It does the job in a short amount of time. It doesn't burn many calories, but it does tone your body."
"Positive","Oddball Florida: We as snowbirds travel to florida each winter, this books is full of info of places we visited that now after reading it, we must revisit some of those places. ""Great Book full of info""DWS"
"Positive","One great war movie on the American Revolution: I really don't have much to say except only what you're going to read from all the other reviews of non-thinkers. So I'll say that and a lot more. The fact is that it was a great war movie, besides that fact it was on the American Revolution. Not all war movies coming out today are on that subject, more on the WWII, and Vietnam. Mel Gibson made his usual appearance and did a good job as usual. At the beginning it was pretty much the same as his Brave Heart appearance. At first he was kind and loving and loved his family. After things went bad and the red coats started ""messing"" with him and his family he started to get infuriated. The killing of the one red coat towards the beginning of the movie that his two youngest sons had to witness was aspecially cruel. The point is that he had some memories of obvious wars in his past."
"Negative","Great But Beware: Look I like this item BUT........I wanted a Rake and Scoop not a little scraper. I can take some of the blame as the item does say say Large Spade Set but shows a rake with the large set ion the picture and in the description.If you want a RAKE then I assume this is the set to buy.http://www.amazon.com/Four-Paws-18245-Rake-Large/dp/B0002AT45K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1294428363&sr;=8-1On a side note the handles are long BUT they are made of wood, my prior scooper / rake set had steel handles which have lasted 5 plus years and are still going strong.I am rating 2 stars because of the misconception that you may be getting a rake when indeed you are getting a very small scraper blade and large scoop"
"Positive","Barbara Crampton looks great in leather!: Great horror movie! Jeffrey Combs does very well in this one"
"Positive","So far so good: I bought it for my dad and I haven't heard any complaints. So I guess everything is working ok. But those head phones are huge!!"
"Negative","WORST CAN OPENER EVER!!!: This can opener took forever to install and now that it is installed doesn't work well AT ALL. if it actually decides it's going to hold a can it drops it as soon as its done opening it. I will be staying away from the Black and Decker brand from here on out!"
"Negative","Waste of money: I bought 3 DVDs and 2 flash cards package hoping to make a super kid out of my 2-year-old. To my surprise the Alphabet and Phonics DVD did not offer any creative teaching tool. Little ones learn better when the information is packaged in the form of music,songs and some dance. This DVD had no songs or action, just some elevator type background music.It fell short of any PBS kids programs. My son didn't pay attention after 10 minutes.The flash card is very attractive but a 2-year-old might find some unfamiliar animal names and words. I found similar flash cards at Walgreens for much cheaper price.I didn't want to open the rest of the DVDs or flashcard, I sent my purchase back and got a refund."
"Negative","You can't hear it at the race: No ProsCons: You can't hear this at the race, over half the codes are out of date and dont work , you cant tell who is talking unless you know the voices , ear buds kill your earsI would not buy any product like this again"
"Negative","This was a big disappointment from my favorite author.: I had planned on writing about how disappointed I was with Barbara Michaels' newst book, but all the other reviews have summed up my feelings perfectly. I hope for her sake, and for the sake of all her loyal readers, that Ms. Michaels reads these messages."
"Negative","Abstract and bloody: The album can best be described as a disturbing abstract painting. It looks good in the museum, but you wouldn't want it hanging on your wall. I enjoyed listening to it once, and I got the art of it. It just doesn't leave me with a pleasant feeling, so I won't listen to it much more, if at all."
"Negative","A rip off of a great work -- do not buy this!!!: The girl who survived the storm -- Samantha Perez -- wrote her own heartbreaking, wonderful story in far more detail and far better. It's free at www.ReadTheTattoo.com. You can download it there for free if you like, or you can read it online.Do not buy or support this version, which pays absolutely nothing to the girl who is struggling to overcome the total destruction of her home by Hurricane Katrina.This version is ripped off from the story SHE wrote and buying it here does NOTHING to help her.Go read the stunning, great work she's doing for The Tattoo at www.ReadTheTattoo.com."
"Positive","Great scanner, but...: The Epson V750 is a great scanner. We bought it for film and slide scanning and have not been disappointed in its performance. It's fast, has fantastic resolution (rivaling much more expensive film scanners) and will do multiple slides or negative strips. The ""but"" refers to the included software. The Epson scanning software is quite good, but I had hoped to be able to use the SilverFast package, which was supposed to be a full software package. Unfortunately, it's a ""crippled"" application, lacking the ability to convert multiple slides in a single scan into individual pictures (which the full application CAN do). This was a major disappointment. So, hardware great, software not so much."
"Negative","A Whiny plea for sex: Throughout this album, the repetitive theme is either losing the guy or sticking with him. The lyrics are pathetic. Most people are not aware that ""hit"" is R and B slang for sex. A number one song giving Britney the image of a whiny boy toy begging for sex is a bit sad. Though the melodies aren't that bad, the lyrics, especially in ...baby one more time are terrible. This album is only for extremests. Most people are either crazy about it or they get the urge to smash the radio everytime they hear one of her songs."
"Negative","It's No Longer Funny Being Green: The original ""Shrek"" was a postmodern deconstruction of the traditional fairy tale. Its deserved success was sure to result in a ""franchise"", but what do you do for a sequel? Deconstruct the deconstruction? ""Shrek 2"" didn't solve this problem, but dodged it through sheer, unrestrained (if also unfocused) energy, and an appealing new sidekick for Shrek (Puss in Boots). Shrek 3, a curiously low-energy effort, neither avoids nor solves the problem. The result is the typical exhausted-franchise work product: a tired, boring, surprisingly conventional movie, with none of the zing of the original. The chief villains are the writers, as the story line is flat and unoriginal, but the lack of inspiration is everywhere evident, even in the animation. As I left the theater, even the kids were complaining."
"Positive","Packs A Wallop: The first two acts of this play sneak up on you. They are endearing, folksy and sweet. Nothing heavy and you're not sure how this play could have become so famous and popular. But boy, the last act hits you with a shot of existential angst stronger than anything else I have ever read. This is one that probably should be read every year for the rest of your life to inspire better living. Read it and see why!"
"Negative","Arcade action at it's worst!: EA claimed they revamped this series. Instead we got an even more arcade style version of Triple Play. Game requires no skill or baseball strategy. No Thanks EA, I'll pass!"
"Negative","Not as good as I hoped: I was hoping a combination of Chris Cornell and Rage would of produced a better album ! It's ok but Chris conned them into putting a couple of bad style songs he put on his 2 solo cds!Hopefully next time they can do better!"
"Positive","Simply beautiful: I have always enjoyed this soundrack so I finally ordered it and can honestly say I enjoy listening to it while driving."
"Negative","Don't buy it!: We have owned this phone system for about a year. It is now very difficult to make a call with it. The buttons either don't work or beep twice when you press them. We quite often hang up on people because the answer button causes the phone to answer and then hang up. You would think a copy like AT&T could do better!!!"
"Negative","not a remix: This is not the remixed version of ""i believe in love"" that you hear in the nightclubs. it's got the plain old version that you can buy from the U.S. release for 2.99."
"Negative","Night Shield Night Moves: I resent that the author used this platform to air her political views. I read for entertainment to get away from all that. I am currently reading another of Ms. Roberts' books and she has done the same thing. No more, Nora!"
"Negative","Where's the beef?: The good:The art is great.Wonder woman is no weakling.Has a little bit of Mythos.Good story concept.Writing (whats there)is great.The bad:It takes about 25 minutes to finish.Hardly any fighting or combat of any kind.Motivating ideas are not fleshed out. Everything is just vague.90 pages long and about 20% have no dialog, narrative, or any writing what so ever.The rest of the pages average about 15-20 words per page.(Not word bubbles but words.)This is the first wonder woman book I have read and am praying that this is not the norm, but judging from the possitive ratings I guess I'm in for disappointment. Is this really that hard of a character to write a quality story for?"
"Negative","Disappointing: This book wastes too many pages covering general Grid Computing history and direction. Not enough detail on Oracle-specific Grid computing."
"Positive","Awesome: Nothing to share, it simply works perfectly and got here quickly. Amazing product, I will never use an iron again."
"Negative","Stereotyping: By and large, such a book probably could have been distributed in Nazi or Communist schools as well (Pavel Morozov is a good example, Hitlerjunge Quex another). Particularily insulting is that German Americans not in goose-step with FDR are portrayed as Nazi sympathizers. But, since nowadays the only ethnic group that can be safely slandered & stereotyped are people of German ancestry, I'm certain that shmonzes will sell well. Gott sei's geklagt!"
"Positive","Much Better: The Walking Dead Season 2, Ep. 10 ""18 Miles Out""was better than the last episode. Written properly well told story and the friction between Rick and Shane showed the true grit and an understanding. overall very entertaining!!"
"Positive","FUNK AND JAZZY: I picked up this cd yesterday after listening to it on the headphones in a local record store. Since this is my first cd by these guys, I was totally amazed. With the exception of track 8 ""Lenny"" the rest of the tracks are jamming. These three guys are smoking on this record. This cd reminds me of 70's sounds that were coming from Herbie Hancock, Tower of Power and some early Sly and the Family Stone.Thank goodness that the Hammond B-3 organ and the clavinet are not dead instruments after all for todays young muscians. If you're a fan of the 70's Jazz Funk scene buy this cd. You will play it continuously without skipping songs."
"Positive","Beware of The Creeper: Jeepers Creepers was an awesome new age horror movie, it was the best idea hollywood had for a horror movie in a long time. The main reason being it introduced us to a new horror icon. First their was Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Movies, then it was Jason From Friday the 13th movies, then it was Freddy from the Nightmare movies, then the Scream Ghost from the Scream Movies, and now it's ""The Creeper"" From Jeepers Creepers. The movie is about how two siblings are taking a cross country drive in a remote area with miles and mlies of flat plane's when they see a guy on the side of the road putting a body bag into a huge drian pipe, so when the two kids think he left one of them go down the huge pipe to see what he put down there, well it was full of dead bodies, so terrified he quickly gets out of there, they both get back into the car but ""The Creeper"" saw everything and now that the two kids saw hid domain he will stop at nothing to silence them...for good"
"Negative","It is horrible!: enough with Genie in a bottle and her version of Chestnuts roasting is clearly an attempt to be like mariah who is a ledgend and christina is a passing fad. nice try, its bad and i do not recommend it! in addition the cover is hard to look at we all know christina in notthe most attractive teeny bopper! Britney is soooo much betterr"
"Positive","great book and excellent topics: the book is great i had to read it for young adult literature and i enjoyed it. great book for intermediate and high school students"
"Positive","Nice Gloves: I like the Harbinger gloves because they have great padding and they aren't black. When you sweat with black gloves, the dark color tends to rub off on your hands, making your hands look quite dirty. The gloves fit snug, but some of the stitching could be a bit better. In any case, I'll probably buy more of them in the future as these wear out."
"Negative","set this house on fire: I am still waiting to receive the book. The seller insists that I received it but has not re-sent it or refunded my money."
"Positive","Once of the greatest songs of all time: Huge anthem for the 90's I must say that this is one of the most beautiful tracks you'll hear. It will lift you up and put you sown. must be listened to on a very loud setting and with excellent quality speakers. If you listen to it like that I promise you that it will move you deeply. Class Choon!!!"
"Positive","A real person's guidebook through the mystery of love-making: A book for everyone who wants to explore, challenge and improve their sexuality. Great to share with a partner or learn on your own!"
"Negative","Misleading: I have no idea how good the bottles are. My complaint is that the picture shows three (3) bottles for the price listed. You get only only bottle. The price listed was okay for three bottles but ridiculous for only one. I obviously returned the bottle for a refund."
"Negative","Don't waste your money: Not enough information to warrant you buying this watercolor book. You can select many more that give much better instruction and more technical advice. Not sure who is writing these other reviews but beware of this one. Pleased to be able to share!"
"Positive","Buy this!!: This was a lifesaver for us. Our baby was always calmed by this bouncer and before they are ready for the musical attachment the seat vibrates and the vibrating part only takes one ""D"" battery. This is a must have!!"
"Positive","Does what it is supposed to do. Great price on Amazon.: Product worked as it should.Cheaper from Amazon and is exactly the same thing as the Corvette branded one GM sells.Nice item to have if you have a car that is stored for the winter or otherwise not driven very often. Cars with proximity FOBs and lots of on board electronics don't like sitting around without charging for more than a couple weeks."
"Negative","Good value but not as advertised.: This Hakuba carbon fiber tripod is a lightweight well-made item that provides good value for the price. However, it is NOT the Velbon CARMAGNE 640 advertised. The CARMAGNE is a carbon fiber tripod with a magnesium top - hence the name CAR (for carbon) MAGNE (for magnesium). The item offered is the cheaper version manufactured by Hakuba (which I believe is the parent company of Velbon) and has ALUMINUM components, not magnesium..."
"Positive","Worth the Watch: Okay, I admit that I was skeptical going in when I saw this. Carmen Electra has always been hot but I was never certain about her acting ability after seeing each of the Scary Movie flicks. But this one, I think, she excelled in her skills. I was laughing most of the time and not just because of the comical narration given by David Hyde-Pierce but because some of the 'nature' of the film was so close to life it was amazing. Worth the watch for a good laugh."
"Positive","Thoroughly Charming: I had no idea Julia Child was such a good writer. Her descriptions of places make you feel like you are there with her. A thoroughly charming book; her personality literally jumps through the pages."
"Positive","Just fine: It is exactly the same as the stock one and works just fine. Actually bought it for another brand of car cause this one never broke and the other brand did four times...."
"Positive","sizing difference: One pair of gloves fit, the other did not. The vendor was very fast and kept in touch, Would use them again, even though not completely satisfied with product."
"Negative","DVD Let's get lost: The DVD Chet Baker, Let's get lost, may be good however, I received the european version(region 1) so I could not view it.I didn't read the fine print.I am hoping that Amazon will alert me when the American version (region 2) becomes available."
"Negative","WORKS LITTLE: FOR THE MONEY, YOU ARE BETTER OFF GOING TO WALMART AND BUYING 2 PACKS OF PET ARMOUR, WHICH IS, GENERIC FRONTLINE PLUS AND WORKS BETTER- KILLS EGGS AND HAS BIRTH CONTROL FOR PEST BUILT IN!! SO DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
"Negative","Not worth it: I was a big fan of Dan and John and have all of their records as well as both solo records by Dan. I've never warmed up to this record, it seems very phoned in to me, especially coming after ""Stones"""
"Positive","Sweetness: I dig this book, but it was a wee bit on the lengthy side. It portrayed everything I'd expect from good ol' James Webb, but I had lots of trouble connecting with its main characters, and I think that this was an outlet of some kind for Mr. Webb. I read it for school. I'm typing a paper on it now. Actually, I'm procrastianting and typing this, but, hey, English class ain't all that exciting...."
"Negative","not what i'd hoped for: wait for the paperback, if you buy this one at all. story somewhat reminescent of ""a simple plan"", but no where near as interesting or dramatic. this one is not up to par: thin characters, weak plot, minimal suspense. obvious ending.i've enjoyed mr. grisham's books very much and hope he is in a brief slump and not out of gas."
"Positive","A FINE STORAGE FOR ALL YOUR POWER TOOL ACCESSORIES.: I purchased this tool box for storing my drill bits,Files,and mostly power tools accesories. The construction seems to be okay and rugged, all ball bearings seem to function well. But the drawer will not give you that perfect pull n push fit as we all wanted to be. When fully loaded it does give you a little effort to handle it. The lock will only hold the top cover and not guarantee to shut secure all the drawers if you dont push it in real good to engaged the notch on the back of the drawers with the other notch catching situated inside the back of the drawer I dont know about the two handles if it can hold the weight when fully loaded. Oh no, This thing aint moving out my garage shelf.But overall for a $150 tool box including shipping your pretty much safe."
"Negative","A Common Life: I was very disappointed in this book. I hope Ms. Karon will stick to the story from now on. Her previous books have been so well written that her fans have high expectations."
"Negative","Great teaching aid, but not in the way Ben Stein intended...: I teach a class that includes logic and logical fallacies. This film is a wonderful teaching tool for me. From start to finish, it is a buffet of logical fallacies. My students are justifiably appalled at the film's obvious weaknesses, such as the film maker's failure to ever provide a single piece of evidence to support the case of intelligent design. The ad hominem association of evolution with the Nazi genocide is so over-the-top that it actually made my students, religious kids included, angry. Thank you, Ben Stein, for making a film so riddled with ignorance of science and fallacious claims -- you have unwittingly helped today's young people to be more vigilant in their examination of claims such as yours!On a personal note, I regret that I had to actually buy this film to use it as a teaching tool. Spending my own money on such laughable propaganda was painful, even when it serves my students well as a negative example!"
"Positive","Smash up the classics: By far the best aspect of this game is how the developers managed to put real world cars in without using the names or having to license them... hence you can smash them up! Excellent game play, lots and lots of different play modes, many cars, and a good (for Playstation) paint booth. The only disappointing part is the announcer... they could have done without that entirely, but it's alright. This game is difficult without being unbeatable, and it has lots of surprises. Get this game soon!"
"Negative","This book is extremely disturbing...: I agree totally with the reader from Portland Oregon. The book was very disturbing throughout the entire beginning and again at the end with rapes,abuse and murder. It isn't much of a romance unless you just read the middle, which was boring."
"Positive","Absolute Thug!: If half of the stuff in this book is true, then this is a story of an absolute thug! The book at certain points is revolting and it becomes difficult to read as atrocities are narrated. The CCP should take a page out of their masters, the old Soviet Union's CP after Stalin, and ""purge"" themselves (yet one more time) of all of Mao's legacy.The Chinese must be very resilient indeed to have come this far in this post-Mao era."
"Negative","what a waste of money!: Terrible product...I wanted to beleive that it was a really good one like we see on Tv..but once again....TV products usually = bad quality.Of course it doesn't work at all, and it's really uncomfortable to use!You have to be really careful if you dont want to hurt your pet while using this product!"
"Positive","WW II story of Nazi occupied Rome.: Based on a true story (The Scarlet Pimpernell of the Vatican) of Msgr Hugh O'Flaharty of the Vatican who runs a clandestine operation to hide allied servicemen and Jews in and around German occupied Rome. His nemisis, S.S. Col. Herbert Kapler, is played by Christopher Plummer. Pope Pius XII is played by Sir John Guilgood. Excellent scenes of the Vatican and Rome, coupled with interesting insight to the rest of the story regarding the Vatican's work with the victims of the war. Good performances and entertaining. END"
"Positive","Good Eats at the Laugh-eteria: Whether you want to groom your kid (or grandkid)to be a literary star or not, this is a good place for you both to start having real fun with words. Think of this book as the literary equivalent of an open fire hydrant on the hottest day of August. These poem-songs tickle and tease like jets of cool water. Best for kids between the ages of 5 and 10, 'tho not too old for a 4 year old or too silly for a 12-year old."
"Positive","Great Eloquence and Wisdom!: Rare, remarkable, and imbued with thought provoking concepts on esoteric mysticism. A must have for the serious occultist."
"Negative","DO NOT BUY: OK this system is great i will admit.. when it works. I bought mine from creative labs 19 months ago. The sub stopped coming on. It just wont power up. i have seen that a lot of people have had this problem. I called and talked to customer support about it.. it turns out they dont care. I was told that they cannot sell me a replacement piece, not only that but they refuse to repair it (i offered to pay for the repair). A friend of mine came over to look at it, and when we opened it up we found that all the wires were glued together lol making it just about impossible to repair (which explains why creative labs doesnt repair their products)So after an hour on the phone with creative labs i learned that creative labs makes cheap products and if they break they dont care. I wont buy anything else from them and i would suggest everyone not either."
"Negative","basically, a failure - more on Victoria than Vincent: Technically, the writing style is very poor. If this was ""ghosted,"" Victoria should get a refund. But, basically - what you've heard on the street about this book is more or less true. For a child that wasn't around all that much, she is writing more from other sources. I hardly expected an unbiased opinion from the child of a broken home, but some of the none-too-subtle suggestions that Vincent was 'bi' and so on - without any factual evidence, only gossip - not to mention WHO CARES - is just too much. Another instance of licking one's emotional wounds in public, I'm afraid. Stick to the marvelous Lucy Chase Williams book, and the interesting recent book put out by Midnight Marquee."
"Positive","Phamtom Planet: The Wade Williams' collection is always superior in quality.He has hard to find films and reproduces them in the best format.It is worth the cost."
"Positive","It is not a ""dog"": It is a great shame this film is not available in U.S. format. I saw it years ago in a theater--with subtitles. If you have a heart, this film can break it. The soundtrack adds greatly to the experience;probably the best ever use of ""Love Hurts"" (Everly Bros.) as part of the soundtrack."
"Positive","A unique fusion of soul, reggae and rock that hit big time.: This was Grant's most successful album and its unique fusion of soul, rock and reggae made it very different from most of the music it was competing with at the time. ""Electric Avenue"" was the big hit but the other songs were very good. Like Stevie Wonder, Eddy Grant is a multi-faceted artist who can play many instruments and write and produce his own material."
"Negative","Average: This book doesn't give you any detail on actual locations. Just vague stories. I wouldn't buy."
"Negative","Dead on arrival: I was intrigued by having one of these since I thought it sounded like a good combination - the ability to control the ipod connected to my stereo from any room. The reality was disappointing since it never worked. I followed all the directions very carefully, and I even checked that the firmware was up to date and tried resetting it to factory defaults. Unfortunately it would not function. The iPod would play fine in the base, and the remote would power up but would never show anything from the iPod and only a few of the buttons functioned.It's impossible to give a fair review when the item is dead on arrival, but one thing I did notice - it puts out a wicked high-pitched whining noise when the remote is functioning. The documentation says that this is normal - but I consider it unacceptable in an audio item."
"Positive","good system: I had a good experience with cybertron. I was confused with the product that I purchased, and the customer service reps quickly provided a detailed and helpful response.However, the product that I received was different than the product described above. Barebones shipped with a Semperon 1.6 Ghz chip installed, which I am told is a better chip..."
"Negative","GOOD TO GET THE OPPORTUNITY: I cant say much about the HD DVDs as over in Australia we do not have HD DVD players as yet and dont know when they will be available. How ever the combo dvds are brilliant as it's the best of both worlds until we get the HD DVD players over here.Thankyou for giving me the opportunity to tell you this information.Cheers Wayne Cross"
"Positive","Every song elicits emotional response: Russell's voice is amazing. The music is delicious! It's hard to imagine this cd would not appeal to anyone with any degree of music appreciation. The music on this cd is relaxing and exciting all in one. His interpretation of Bohemian Rhapsody gives me chills, goosebumps, thrills etc. In fact every song on this cd elicits an emotional response. It's a must for every cd collection and makes a wonderful gift!"
"Positive","Simply Amazing.: Simply amazing.Lets face it, there are other, better more engrossing games out there, sure. However, Guild Wars, with it's pick-up-and-play interface and relatively low level cap make it a personal favorite MMO, if only because I have a REAL life, and can only play occasionally. If you want an excellent experience, great community, and an all around fun time, go ahead and spring for GW, seriously. No monthly charges!"
"Negative","Second damaged shipment from Amazon: Logitech X-540 5.1 Speaker SystemThis is the second time that I'll be sending the X-540 speakers back. The first time, parts were clearly rattling around in the subwoofer. I suspect that the damage occured in transit as the packaging wasn't what you would call robust. The books that Amazon ships are much better protected.Anyhow, I shipped that set back and requested a replacement set which just arrived. With the same damage to the subwoofer! That indicates to me that the build quality of the subwoofer could be a lot more robust even with the sparse packaging.I'll shop for a different product, probably from a box store as Amazon haven't mastered shipping these things!"
"Negative","Self-absorbed and Pretentious: Although the food descriptions were mouth-watering and the inclusion of recipes was a pleasant surprise, over-all the book was tedious. The local Italians were written about in a condescending and patronizing manner. Some of the text served only to get petty jabs in on other more accomplished authors. After reading this book, I still prefer Provence!"
"Positive","Looks nice, but check your USB power: This product appears to be of good quality, but the snag is that if your USB ports do not provide 650 milliamps of power, you will have to purchase a separate cord to boost the power. This is the one thing that I wish was listed in its specifications. I have a Mac PowerBook G4 (purchased in 2004) and the USB ports provide only 500 milliamps. So, check your machine's specs before purchasing this. I would have kept the product, had my USB port had enough power. It is very compact and easy to store.As one other reviewer noted, my package came with only a 6 inch USB cord, even though it says it is supposed to be 22 inches."
"Positive","AMAZING FOR THE PRICE: I have a canon rebel t3 and its been about a month or two since ive purchased this tripod. its pretty steady but since im a beginner im not taking this tripod to the mountains. if you are a professional i suggest you get a more expensive one, but other than that its great for beginners very lightweight and handy. you can also take vertical shots which i was very surprised. :D"
"Positive","diddy is number one: Haters give it up cause the album is tight. If you ain't feeling it , don't worry it cost you nothing."
"Positive","Cyber Acoustics AC-201 Stereo Headset/microphone: This product is an excellent value. The sound quality is very good and the headset is very comfortable."
"Negative","Bye bye bye: I am soooo sick of hearing this song. These boys arent as talented as some of you would like to think they are. I bought the *NSYNC cd for my boys and I could not listen to the whole thing. I'm so glad that they like the Backstreet Boys better. They have a great deal of vocal talent that these clowns cant touch."
"Positive","Definitely for collectors/adults: Rock has written a great review of this ""toy."" I have collected many of these HP figures; one of the wands actually broked when I tried to remove it from the package, and let me tell you, these tiny little things are a PAIN (not to mention next to impossible) to glue. TINY TINY TINY...so these are definitely not for little children, especially with the small part factor. Again, cannot rave enough about the sculpt and how much this one looks like the movie version of Voldemort."
"Positive","A Must Have For All Temp Fans!: The Temps are my husband's and my fav soul group. My husband saw them live in Lawrence, Kansas at K.U. in the 60's. I am so jealous! It is so difficult to find live performances of the 60's soul music. This is a great compliation of many of their hits. The images are wonderful and the narration is great. The sounds, the harmony, the moves. A must have! I miss them all so much! Here are Eddie, David and all at their very best."
"Positive","Useful !: This little inexpensive item keeps my ear phones from tangling and easy to use instantly when needed. Generally, untangling my ear phones is a big task and also end up spoiling them this way."
"Negative","Developmental Experts say these are BAD FOR BABY: I'm going to write this on all the Exersaucers. I was considering purchasing one of these for my daughter who is 8 months old. However both a physical therapist and an occupational therapist told me that I shouldn't waste my money on one. They said that they are not good for babies because they don't encourage the proper development of the muscles and the proper development of the postures needed for standing and walking. Many times, babies who use these, even for short periods will develop bad habits such as standing on tippy toes or having their legs face the wrong direction and this can delay when they walk on their own. I know that this is tempting because of all the activities on there, but they said a playpen is much better."
"Positive","Classic Michener: I'm a Michener fan, and rate this one as ""third,"" after ""Mexico,"" and ""Alaska."" Certainly much better than ""Carribean."" I can't speak to the historical accuracy of the book, but reading this book has inspired me to read more about Polish history. I certainly understood the Kosciuszko rebellion much better in this context than I had in other readings. Until we reach the Siege of Vienna I found it hard to get into the particular characters in this novel -- they seemed kind of poorly fleshed-out and generic. After that, I started to care much more about the characters.The most amazing chapter is the description of the Nazi oppression. Michener has done a fine job of taking this incomprehensibly inhuman horror and helping the reader understand it from the eyes of single (fictional) individuals who experience it. At several points, I found myself weeping during this chapter."
"Positive","Learn to read your dog: This DVD set is great value for anyone who owns a dog or works with dogs in any capacity at all. It teaches you a great deal about how to read and interpret dog's behaviour and you will learn to see communication signals that your dog is sending which you have never noticed before. It is great value for improving your understanding of dogs and improving your relationship with them."
"Positive","I am happy with Labtec WebCam Pro: I am happy with my purchace so far. I think I got what I paid for. Nothing particularly good or bad about it to say so far."
"Positive","Great Purchase!!: I recently bought this food processor from Amazon and I absolutely love it!! I make a lot of vegetarian meals in which they call for the use of a food processor. Having the smallest version that Cuisinart makes--about 3 cups--I stuck with the company. The base of this 9 Cup food processor is solid/heavy (around 3-5 lbs). Thus, I can walk away and not worry about it falling off the counter. Clean up is also really easy--just be careful of the sharp blades. Great purchase and I highly recommend this product."
"Positive","Great Shirt: Great quality shirt & really quick posting to the UK, would recommend to anyone in UK as these shirts are not available here."
"Negative","This is an Ink Gobbling Cash Bandit: I rarely use a printer. Maybe 25 sheets or less per year and somehow I purchased this printer and all I ever do is pour money into it for ink that I don't even use.The ripoff with this printer is you MUST use 4 ink cartdiges and you cannot simply put in 4 black cartridges if you want. The printer will not function at all and forces you to buy more ink if you want to use it.I had no idea this was the deal or I would never have wasted my money."
"Positive","Master Lock is wodnerful: My daughter kept locking herself out of the house, so we ordered the Master Lock. It was very easy to install and it is very functional. We love it."
"Positive","Excellent rice with a nutty flavor: I had a receipe for rice and ordered this because it suggested this kind of rice. I can see why. I had looked in local stores and had been unable to find it."
"Negative","Doesn't make the case: Apart from the section on Shannon, who is not covered well by others, I found very little to recommend this book. Much of the material is popularized elsewhere and Seife is not a compelling writer who can clarify concepts. I remain to be convinced that conceits equating the universe with a giant quantum computer really enhance our understanding of the universe, or its contents. Particularly as we still have no idea what 96% of the universe is made of (dark matter)!!! In essence, saying that information explains everything is rather like saying language is made up of words that have to be in specific patterns to make sense...a worthless tautology that sounds great but whose information content is zero."
"Positive","striclee bizniss: dis album iz da shiznit. if u love rap, cop it now. if yo a fan of souf rap, make sho its yos. dis cd aint no joke. its tight as a ho's gstring an fresh as some grocery produce. cmon an get cha some playa rabbit cuts. deez iz dem 'off da chain wit it' typa joints, ya feel me? cant nuthin compare wit nunna dis. u wont regret orderin it, so go an purchase u 1 now!"
"Positive","It was in my wish list for 6 months :)...and now it's on my wrist: I had an eye on this watch for over six months and was reading the reviews posted by all customers. Finally I got it for myself as an Early ""Fathers Day"" Gift ;o)Pros: Excellent Watch. All Pros have been mentioned by previous reveiwers.Cons: The only major shock I got was the color of the face plate which is totally different from what amazon has put on thier website. But after some days I got used to this color. It is very very very dark blueIf the color is a major factor in your buying this wathc, then please see the watch in person before making your decision.Even I had to adjust the strap for 10 bucks as even I;ve got thin wrists.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase and already got a ton of compliments from all my friends who have seen it"
"Positive","Buy it!!!!!!!!!!: What more do i have to say .....jim roberti ..the name should tell it all. For those of you who know him well you know what im talking about, for those who dont well let me explain real quick. You name it Jim a.k.a ""the man"" Roberti can sing it all you name it he can sing it better. thats right.. better....jim im a big fan and love your music, cant get enough.. keep the poconos happy with your awsome music, your the best..ill see u monday, tuesday.."
"Negative","No Meat: This book was casual to read, flip through, but did nor have any real information that would help a pitcher. It did have a big name in the title."
"Positive","movie buff: very good quality and well packaged. the movie was well type cast and the story line was engrossing. a good movie"
"Negative","A Disappointing Quest: Although mainly reading the book as an obligation, I expected that the topic of wrestling would be enough to keep me interested. To my disappointment the book was mainly about a teenage boys and his ""experiences"" that distract him from the sport. The content was out of place and, at times, disturbing. The author builds up a mediocre amount of suspension when Louden decides to go one-weight class lower, yet manages to disappoint the reader again with an incomplete ending which fails to leave the reader with a sense of curiosity or satisfaction."
"Positive","An Over Priced Classic: I've been a huge fan of this group since high school.I had all their albums on vinyl,tape,and most of them on CD.They are a legendary group.I'm 60 years old now,probably they are too.All of their albums are reasonably priced except this one.It's an awesome album,that I'd love to own.But the price is ridiculous.I'd never pay $100.00 dollars for any album.Bring the price down to a reasonable amount of $15-$20,and I'll buy it.Even a bonafide collector isn't stupid enough to pay the price your site has on it.We live in tough economic times.Give the public's wallet a break."
"Negative","There Are No Words...: This book absolutely disgusted me. Not only does it butcher the good name of one of the most outstanding and honorable figures of literature, but it is written with such precision and detail that you can almost imagine the words are Watson's! While this would otherwise be commendable, here it only serves to deepen the betrayal.If you seek a true-to-Canon pastiche, I recommend Nicholas Meyer or Loren D. Estleman. Please, for your sanity and your stomach, steer clear of Dibdin."
"Positive","Obsessive Genius: It was a wonderful biography of Marie Curie and very interesting but there were times I got lost in all the technology and chemistry of it. I would rate it a 4 1/2 but the stars above wouldn't let me rate it that way. What an amazing woman and what amazing accomplishments and contributions she made especially in that time."
"Negative","good for small children: i found this book pretty dull. i guess if i were 9 or 10, it would be more interesting. it is, however, easy to understand."
"Positive","My brother gave me this book initially...: and since then I've given several, several copies away to friends. Brilliant essays and commentaries. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in culture and politics."
"Positive","Great Study Bible: Life Application Study Bible NIVThis Bible is the best Bible I have ever seen. It is in clear, easy to understand text. It has an enourmous amount of detil regarding all characters in the Bible. It also has great easy to read Maps so that you can see just exactly where the events took place.I have several Bibles and this one is the best!"
"Positive","Jim Croce All Time Hits: As a big fan of Jim Croce it is not hard to give this a good review.You get what you expect,no surprises."
"Negative","Waste of money!: I bought this item for my son for Christmas. It is very poor quality. It broke right away. Do not waste your money on this piece of junk!"
"Positive","Great movie: I love this movie and the charecter Madea! VERY funny! Tyler Perry's characters are so hilarious! My goal is to own the entire collection"
"Negative","funny start, creepy finish: The first part of Naked I found hilarious, especially the the Sedaris mother with her frosty hair, Dinah the Chirstmas whore, and the mystery of who is using the household towels as toilet tissue. But as soon as the book went into the hitchhiking it got really creepy and never got back its offbeat humor for me, just disturbed me. I recommended tuning into the author's sister Amy on Comedy Network's ""Strangers With Candy Instead""."
"Negative","Had it for 3 days: Though very impressed with the form factor , dual lens etc, I was very unimpressed with picture quality in low light and indoor conditions.I really wanted to hold on to the camera inspite of the low light quality issues because I liked the form so much. But then happen to compare the image with Canon SD600 and I couldn't justify keeping it.So returned the V570, and placed an order on Amazon for SD600. Waiting for its arrival.Here are the Pros and Cons:PROS1.Stylish Form Factor2.Wide Angle PhotographyCons1.Cannot connect the camera to a PC without that docking cradle2.Even if you connect, the camera memory storage doesn't appear as a drive . Instead you need to run the Kodak software to transfer the image.3.Poor Indoor Image quality."
"Negative","not like it promised: I thought it was cute & it did work really good for first few times but not now. It is so hard to get the point onto the top of the can. you have to turn it (the can)on it's side to get it in the right spot. It is not easy. A regular can opener is so much better."
"Positive","Well written book: The book does a pretty good job of simplifying the feeding of raw foods to your dog - I've fed raw before so it was a nice review. It is not a detailed and technical as some books, so I would recommend including other books for information also. But a good book - I would recommend it."
"Negative","WARNING: The Very Worst of Kolchak!!!: Understand -- I am the world's biggest NIGHT STALKER fan. I saw the premiere at age 11. I own every single episode on video, and both movies. Karl Kolchak is the funniest, coolest, most exciting monster hunter in the world!But don't buy this video. TREVI COLLECTION and YOUTH KILLER are the two weakest episodes in the series. TREVI is about a witch who kills a bunch of fashion models. There are no scares, just really lame stuff with mannequins coming to life and some poor girl getting scalded in the shower. It's ugly, not scary. Lara Parker from DARK SHADOWS is okay, but not really good as a truly evil human being.YOUTH KILLER is so bad it should never even have aired. It feels like a ""half speed"" episode in slow motion. There's an ancient Greek goddess causing young singles to age overnight because somehow it helps her stay alive forever. Very poor episode, no action and a lot of needless mockery of the elderly and singles."
"Negative","Bad sets. Egyptians garbed like Catholics: What happens on the stage has none of the fun you look for. A bare-breasted woman hauling in a snake?Some Egyptian priests have on lace-fringed surpluses, looking like Catholic priests. Altar boys in the background. Women wearing crosses nestled in their cleavages?The director really screwed this one up. Listen to CDs, and use your imagination."
"Negative","Disappointing: Not enough photos to convey an overall feeling of the east meets west look. Many pictures were too item specific. Some of the commentary interesting but not comprehensive enough."
"Positive","Good book - a drop in the bucket: Whether Zionist Jews or white Europeans are running the world makes no difference to me. Whether Zionists are 'sucking the blood' out of America or the West is sucking the blood out of Africa, makes little difference to me.Then again, maybe these same Zionists used the Dutch and the British to 'open up' South Africa for diamonds and such the same way Americans were used to 'open up' Iraq.AIPAC and PNAC are nothing new. We're talking Rothschilds, Federal Reserve, CFR, World Bank, Oppenheimer (nuclear), Oppenheimer (diamonds)... and the irony of such names - Sterling, Kristol, Perle, Gold, Silver, Rich. Plucking away pro-Israeli lobbies won't make much of a difference.The only things Americans know en masse are what media tells them... and 'these people' control the media."
"Negative","An object lesson on what drugs can do to a brain: This book illustrates the effects of long-term drug and alcohol abuse far better than any lecture a parent can give. Mr. Ellis can't anymore distinguish between reality and the replays in his imagination. It's hard to feel compassion or even interest for someone who has lots of money and fame and feels so, so sorry for himself."
"Positive","Incredible Book: I've been collecting comics for over twenty years, but this book blew me away. I'd read another review that said that everything in the book was common knowledge, and I can't see how anybody could say that. It was really in-depth and insightful, and surprisingly enough it was very well written. I don't usually read biographies, but this book was pretty much a bio on Jack Kirby. The only thing about it, is that after reading it, you may view the comics industry differently. It's a shame the way that the artists (and some writers) were treated by the comic companies. This book was incredibly detailed, and was full of many quotes from industry professionals throughout the years. Highly recommended, especially if you liked Kavalier & Clay."
"Negative","The 5 love languages for singles: I would give it no stars but the program will not let me do so. I cannot write an appropriate review since I never received the book and that was over a month ago (Jan. 7). Not sure what to do."
"Positive","A marriage saver: Dr. Chapman's book was truly a blessing from God for our marraige. I highly reccommend this book to anyway who is having maritial difficulties or considering divorce. He illustrates a scripture based wasy to give you hope, make changes, love, and save your marriage.."
"Negative","Worth the read: The book is worth reading since it highlights the issues of underlying suppositions in a verbal exchange. Focusing on this will surely save much frustration. However I can't say that I have run into any of her 8 standard verbal attacks. The chapters on body languange, as well as gender language styles are all quite dated."
"Negative","Incomplete Package: Product was missing two items (picture cradle and hand strap). A replacement was sent and the same two items were missing. Had to return both products because of the missing items."
"Positive","A triumph of analysis: This book is a masterpiece. Brilliantly written, clearly argued. Even after 30 years, you cannot read this book and not have your opinions of urban poverty transformed. We need more thinkers like William Julius Wilson, who insists that his theories be drawn from the facts, rather than marshalling facts selectively to support his prejudices."
"Positive","Great spoon: Spoon is sturdy and the handle is so comfortable when I am mixing ingredients that I cannot use my Kitchen Aid mixer on."
"Positive","Had the VHS so upgraded to DVD: My favorite workout video! This is a fun workout so you don't realize you are working as hard as you are.You will probably be sore the next day."
"Negative","most depressive reading I ever had: I have heard about this book through my bioenergetic circle and as we are working with iching a lot, looked forward to read it, purchased it to be more informed about medical side of it.For me it turned out to be very confusing in technics, and awful depressive in explanation. After having tried to read it for 2 hours I have thrown it away as soon as I reached the wastebin. Not that I easily throw books away, normally I admit that the book can be not for me for the moment, though there was something really negative in it, I did not even want to show it to anyone to get someone elses opinion. Hope there will be more positive books on medical iching."
"Negative","An embarassment.: Firstly, I'll start off by saying that I'm a Jewel fan, insofar as I'm a big fan of her music (both published and not).That out of the way, this book of ""poetry"" is sub college magazine drivel, with Jewel and her navel sharing moments of extreme intimacy, and proceeding to a)bore the reader senseless and b)bore the reader senseless in a very poorly constructed way.Even the title is essentially meaningless (if slightly clever) wordplay, and don't expect the rest of the book to even live up to that.Only buy this if the book is the exact thickness to prop up a specific wobbly table leg in your house. Otherwise you'll find it's useless."
"Positive","Good Harp: I'm a starter Harmonica player so I got this one just to screw around with. It's a lot of fun! It fits perfectly in my pocket and its got a nice sound to it. I give it 4 not five because it comes with a paper case not any sort of protection. It's durable but it has no protection so be careful."
"Positive","Best Show Around: Even if you don't like this programme (how could you not???), it's worth buying simply to watch George Eads the whole way through. He's so hot. The combination of a good cast and interesting (if not often creepy) storylines, keeps me watching this show each and every week and I could watch all of these episodes over and over. Go out and buy this now. It will get you hooked."
"Negative","DRM NO: Plain and simple. I will not buy this game as long as the DRM is part of the deal. I am not a criminal. I will not be treated like one to play a game."
"Positive","Yes, all is connected and all from a Transcendent Creator: This is an absolutely fascinating book of spiritual importance. Hopefully, this one is not the only one seeing the magnificence of the Creator in all of this science.Metaphysics led me to the study of quantum physics this work seems to prove the Shamanic Teachings of the connection of all things and leads me down more wonderful paths.It is of particular interest to me that my physician recommended this book.peace and love to you all---- the ancient"
"Negative","Plastic Threading comes off: I bought this because it was cheap. I kept it on the camera all times. When I screwed in a cheap SEIKOS 82mm polarizing filter, it stayed there. The polarizing filter keep turning, but won't come off the TIFFEN UV filter. I had to break the cheap Polarizing filter to find out the thread on the TIFFEN filter was made of plastic and it simply ground away when the SEIKOS filter turned.Now I have to buy both filters new. I am buying a SIGMA glass filter with antiglare coating. Don't buy this cheap filter. spend extra money and get a good brand like SIGMA or CANON."
"Positive","My First Show: My very first payed concert was to see Fountains of Wayne at the House of Blues in anaheim. Lucky for me, OKGO was the opening band and completely rocked my world. They are such great performers and there songs make you want to dance and sing and laugh all night!!! I've loved them ever since and have not gotten tired of listening to their CD. Do you self a favor and buy this CD and their new release OHNO! With their mix of guitars, keyboards and rockin drums, its a sound you won't forget."
"Negative","Whatever: Difficult reading. Unfocused. Parts of the book were very good but in the end, it left me feeling somewhere between wanting more and being happy it was finally over, like feeling nothing. Sort of like this review... *usually Clive Barker is The Greatest but not this time*"
"Positive","Doctor Who Complete Specials 2009: The run time on the UK PAL version of this set of Doctor Who Specials is 240 minutes on 5 discs. The US version set to be released in February 2010 has a run time of 131 minutes. Something is definitely missing from the US version. Don't know why they do that. I'm sure the legions of Doctor Who fans in the US would be willing to pay more to get the complete set that is available to UK fans. Please don't sell us short!"
"Negative","sent mens's instead of women's: I ordered womens sweat pants extra large and I was sent mens extra large.They are to big.Instead of sending them back I use them for bed only. I am very disappointed in this mix up. I know that extra large in womens fit me right."
"Negative","worst product with worst supprot from worst company: uniden CLX475-3 does not support the new daylight saving time. I contact uniden support and the solution I got from them is to manually change the time. I can't believe this is their solution."
"Positive","Simply Amazing and very authentic research: As a Daudi Bohra, I can attest to the quality of research the author has put in to his work to create this really interesting case study on our community. He has done it not from secondary sources but by living within the community, understanding its customs and learning its language.I found this account very well structured and intellectual and it presents an example of how great leadership can transform a community to live harmoniously in this age and yet value their centuries old religious principles.Great job Sir."
"Negative","The worst next gen controller.: The Xbox' controller is a horrible controller. There are many reasons why it is this bad. The #1 reason why this is bad is because it is so dang chunky. For those with little hands this controller is absolutely out of the question. You need a map to find all the buttons(obviously just kidding). The controller is the source of your gameplaying skills and being chunky, well beng chunky aint good. Another reason of the teribbelness9is that a word?0 is the shape and placement of the buttons. i mean comeon oval? The buttons are also stuck on the tippy top of the controller which(again) means that this will be tough for the little handed ones. This is the pain lovers best friend because you're going to be experiencing just that. This pad is also well extrmely ugly. [$$$] for this mess...Come on?Sure the Xbox has some good games but come on we don't need pain just to play a game. We have enough pain in real life. Atleast Microsoft of japan has a smaller controller..."
"Positive","BEST MOVIE: This is one of my favorite movies! I purchased this movie around 3 years ago and I think I am going to need another VHS because I watch mine so much I think mine is wearing out! I wish they would release it on DVD soon!!!We should all write email MGM and tell them they should release it! I absolutely love every Judy Garland and Gene Kelly movie. When they are together it is magic! They had chemistry! love it and I know you will too!!!These kinds of movies make me wish I lived back in the days of these wonderful musicals! I think Judy and Gene is the best couple ever!! So cute! There will never be anyone like them again! One of a kind. I wish more people would come to love these timeless films!"
"Positive","Survivor 3 Africa: This was an exciting season. I loved it and couldn't wait to buy more!Amazon has everything I want!"
"Negative","Too Uncomfortable: I haven't tried the earphones on a plane, but I found out right away that wearing the headphones is like putting a piece of wood on each ear, and holding it there with a C-clamp. It's that bad.I had thought Sony would have more comfortable earphones, but no.Save your money and get a better- but more expensive model that treats your ears properly."
"Positive","Amazing Compilation: Here is a compilation full of wellknowns and a few unknowns. Most people (like one of the featured reviews mentions) are unaware of the British rock band Muse who contributes their track ""Cave"" at #10 on this cd. The track is off their 1999 album ""Showbiz"" which is a musthave for any rock fan.all in all, its an amazing cd!"
"Negative","Since it doesn't come apart it's almost impossible to clean: For $50 the Chef's Choice M840 Waffle Pro Express Waffle Maker isn't a good deal. My main gripe is it doesn't make a good waffle. Even at the highest color number and texture settings the waffles don't get really golden brown or crisp. And if you make the mistake of putting in to much batter it will over flow and spill out, getting into every nook and cranny, and there's a lot of them. Since it is not designed to take apart cleaning out the over flowed batter is a real nightmare. Whoever gave this waffle iron 4 and a half stars was either insane or on the take."
"Positive","Amazing film: Its strange that this wasnt released here in the UK. but if you want a good fun blood splatter funny horror, then this is for you. Also if you look at the region and it says region unknown they will play on the UK Xbox high defintion drive."
"Negative","It is not well documented: I didn't like the documentary. It has some mistakes in the information. It should have options in the menu, with subtitles or more language options."
"Positive","I loved it.: As a man who loves all things SF, this book captures with tactician skill the nuances of post WWII SF youth/outlaw culture. Quick, go go read as well. Reminds me of Fante if that works for you. Highly recommended."
"Positive","Works great!: This mineral oil has given new life to my worn wooden kitchen items. Works great on bamboo too. Easy to apply, food safe, and good price; what more could you ask for?This oil is more viscous than some I got at a big box store, but I have seen no difference in performance. This is maybe marginally faster to apply."
"Negative","Disappointed by Hardlex crystal: After spending 40 years with a watch on my wrist, and changing watches every couple of years without breaking a single one of them, I decided to buy a watch that I *really* liked, that I would keep for a while, and that would not have to send back to Seiko every two years for battery changes (for waterproofing). So I bought this one.I cracked the Hardlex ""crystal"" twice in 12 months. The first time I had it replaced. The second time I am calling it quits. How is it possible for this material to break so easily, when I have never previously broken a watch? I cannot be that hard on them... Hardlex (or the variety of it that comes on this watch, since Seiko uses different varieties for different watches) simply cannot be classified as good quality protection for this watch. Possibly the glass does not have enough curve and is too flat in this watch to resist impact?"
"Negative","NOT Mac friendly...: I bought this to use with my Macbook Pro and VLC player, Quicktime Pro, and a few other video player/editing software. I could not get it to work any of the applications, even though it has a drop down selector for numerous software titles. Also, it would not accept custom hotkeys, rather you have to press the key on the keyboard itself, and it doesn't recognize key-combinations (shift-command-left, etc...). And it doesn't accept any type of text/xtml file to create your own customized keys.I wish I could say something positive, but really, it didn't work for me--at all."
"Negative","Waste of money: This book is not cram at all. Not even detail to cover up the exam. I think only good as extra reference for studying. It is waste of money."
"Positive","Man of Comedy: Everyone should get this movie. This movie was so under rated. Red Foxx, Richard Pryor, Della Reese and Eddie on the same screen together. Wow!"
"Positive","Nice Headset: This headset is confortable and the works great. Feed line is adequate in length and allows for some mobility. Sounds great."
"Positive","Knight Rider: Great series.I wish they had continued making it. I am still trying to find the 2008 tv movie that started this series."
"Negative","the worst in the whole series so far: Ther's not alot to say about this book. The book was just to boring to deserve a better grade. All of s.d.perrys books were awsome of course exept for caliban cove. Mrs perry just failed to keep me exited unlike her other resident evil books.the descriptions were not as efective as the others. The story itself was pretty bad. I mean zombies with machine guns come on. They can hardly walk on there own legs how are they going to use machine guns. Even though it is the worst book in the series you should still read it to follow along with the series."
"Negative","What do you when you have to write a book and you are out of ideas?: Repetition of boring or dusgusting scenes come after each other in this ""literary"" work. The writer was clearly out of ideas and stuck to the formula ""gore+boredom+fashion tips from eighties (really?)"" I only started to read this book because friend of mine said that's it's the only book that he could not finish because of gore and another one said that he couldn't finish it because it was so boring.seriously, don't waste your time, whatever the autor was ""trying"" to say can be paraphrased ""I was a yuppy and I hated it,"" spend the 10 dollars on ice-cream."
"Negative","not worth it: I did a lot of research before buying this stroller and thought I had a winner. Unfortunately, I have been disappointed with my purchase. Yes, it is very lightweight and easy to open and close; however, the steering is awful. Going straight is fine, but trying to turn corners around clothing racks in a store is a nightmare. The harness hooks to the back cushion but comes undone as soon as my daughter gets in, allowing her to lean forward as far as she wants. The cupholder on the child's tray doesn't even fit her sippy cup. I do not feel the price and quality of this product match."
"Negative","Great movie - Digital Copy does not work: Bought 3 movies for my train trip to NYC. Two digital copies worked fine but this one does not. When I contacted both Universal Digital Copy and Amazon there was ""nothing they could do""."
"Positive","Super cute: My son really enjoys his jitter buggy, it has cute indicator lights and sounds, he loves the vibration, he's 6 months and has sat happily in it up to an hour while I was cleaning. Once he gets bored with one side, I turn the seat so he's facing the other direction. I got it on sale at a great price so definitely worth the price.It is a bit bulky, luckily our apartment has an open layout so it tucks away against a wall, but it is not portable and you can't really store it. I do move it room to room without any problem, even when he is in it, I just push it into the kitchen or family room and nothing falls apart (as another reviewer wrote)"
"Positive","Worth getting for the Interviews: I remember buying this way back when Storm Front was first released. I live in Australia, and Storm Front was my first introduction to Billy Joel's music, and like everyone else I was completely blown away. The interviews are also good, especially the first one from the mid-eighties. There's one part where he shows how he came up with the lyrics to the song ""Innocent Man"" that has to be heard to be believed. I think that, along with John Farnham, Billy Joel is one of my favourite musical raconteur's. Intelligent, literate, as well as being very witty when he needs to be.Still...now that the four-disc box set has been released, there's probably not much point in buying this edition unless you're a completist. But it doesn't take away from the fact that Billy Joel's music is brilliant. Speaking as an Australian, he's only one of two musicans who (to me) truly represent all that's good about America, the other being Bruce Springsteen."
"Positive","This is a great book.: I just read the boloney review, and if anything is boloney, that review is. Educated and intelligent people recognize this. It may be that ""boloney reveiwer"" could benefit from one of the wonderful cleanses that Linda Page presents.Anyway, Linda Page certainly has respectable credentials, and her work is highly respected by professionals and people around the world."
"Positive","Excellent and very enjoyable: Great addition to anyone's musical palate. Good from driving or just sitting @ Home. This guy is a really good.musician."
"Positive","Another Connelly Great: As this book has been extensively reviewed, I will be brief. Connelly is obviously a well known author and sometimes I have found that well known authors sell more based on their name (and just rehashing the same old stuff) than by originality. This author, however, knows how to keep it fresh. That's why I appreciated the Lincoln Lawyer. It's a great legal thriller and though Connelly is not a lawyer, he does a great job keeping you going in this book. Two thumbs up from me!"
"Negative","poorly made: I have had this unit for just over a year. Beware that the cd tray is in front and it slides in and out. Because of this design, it is prone to misalign the cd, which will either not load and the ""no disc"" warning will show or when it does play, there is a significant vibration. To try to remedy this I had to wedge a piece of folder paper inbetween the disc drawer and the unit! Alas, I just got tired of not being able to play a disc for my daughter at bedtime. It is now time to spend a bit more and get a better product such as a Sony.....By the way, the buttons are cheap and the overall construction is poor."
"Positive","Fantastic Ride On Battery Charger: This charger is great for the lazy, no, make that the ""forgetful"" battery charging parent. You can set it and forget it. This unit works anywhere from being a deep cell charger through a maintenance trickle charger. It has yet to disappoint my children. Be warned that even this battery charger can't fix broken batteries or batteries with less than 1 volt in them, but it will treat poor batteries better than the cheaper fisher price charging unit."
"Positive","Perfect heater for my son's bedroom: We needed a small, safe heater for our young son's bedroom and this heater has turned out to be perfect. The heater stays cool to the touch when it is on and puts out A LOT of heat. Wonderful product."
"Negative","It was OK: Bought it as a gift, but it was a little too cheap looking to give as a gift. Pretty and sparkly, but very lightweight. Can't put it outdoors when windy. Still ok."
"Positive","Quality ladder although difficult to maneuver inside a house or garage.: I bought this ladder and it worked fine, is quality construction and lived up to everything it advertised. My issue is that this ladder is big, heavy and very difficult to maneuver in my house & garage so I returned it. Probably not a good solution for inside a house like changing ceiling light bulbs or fans however for outdoor projects this should work just fine. Werner makes a quality ladder and this one is well built."
"Positive","Awesome!!: I got it as a gift for my husband!!! Its gorgeous!! He absolutely loves it!! Inspires one to paint!! A must have for anyone with an artistic streak to explore."
"Positive","Monster FM Transmitter does not disappoint: I purchased the Monster RadioPlay Wireless FM Transmitter for my wife for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it. She uses it almost all the time when she is in the car. The reception is excellent and the sound/clarity is as good as the quality of the mp3 (since mp3's can be recorded at different settings).Overall I am very pleased and would have no problem purchasing another Monster produce."
"Negative","Product makes me ill: I don't have Hashimoto's, and relatively few allergies, but this product makes me nauseous and upsets my regularity. It made me feel funky all day. I tried it three different times, with different foods, different times of the day, and once without food. All three times had the same effect. I threw the rest away. It might have been a bad batch?"
"Positive","Jim Shore purchase: My Jim Shore purchase at Amazon was excellent! I love the angel. I got Summer, spring, winter and I am looking forward to finding the fall angel now. Delivery was very prompt, the package was carefully wrapped so nothing would get broken. I couldn't have asked for better service and a better product. Thank you!"
"Positive","Clear and concise, but requires supplementation: Griffiths' QM text provides excellent problems and a coherent, though somewhat cryptic, development of the theory. He has a conversational style (also evident in his EM text) that elucidates many of the hard-to-visualize concepts in QM. However, he relies on the use of many specialized techniques to solve problems. If the student is unfamiliar with the mathematical tricks involved, it leads to frustration. I recommend Griffiths' text as the main book in a QM course only if it is supplemented with additional hints (from the professor) on the problems, or with an additional text such as Shankar's or the Eisberg and Resnick work."
"Negative","Easy and cheesy...: This is not a challenging work out at all. The cardio portion is not long enough and barely had my heart rate up. The toning section is ok, but she doesn't do enough reps on any exercise.I'm sorry to say this, but Denise is beyond perky and irritating through the whole work out as well.This might be good if you're a beginner, but not a satisfying prenatal work out otherwise.Why is it SO hard to find a prenatal work out this both safe and challenging???!!!"
"Positive","This stuff does what it says!!: My husband and I moved into our new home, only to find we had an ant problem. First there were just a few and then there were hundreds!! We tried home remedies, like boric acid (which helped at first) but it didn't solve the problem. We went online and read a lot of the reviews on this product... well we were amazed at how fast this stuff works!! At first they came out of the woodwork swarming all over this stuff. Then there were very few after just a few hours. I know most of the reviews I read said no ants in about 3 days, but I am am very happy with the results I have seen so far."
"Negative","Do not fit knobs: We have standard kitchen cabinets and knobs but these locks were too short to span our knobs well and the locking bar was too thick to secure behind the knob. We returned these and have opted for the cable locks."
"Negative","Did she really write this?: I have been a Woodiwiss fan for decades, so I really hate to say anything negative, but this book is so bad I can hardly believe she actually wrote it. Everything from the title to the plot to the characters to the actual choice of words was out of kilter with her usual style. Other reviewers have given specifics and I agree - if you must read this, get it at the library but don't waste your money buying it. It is not worth adding to your collection."
"Positive","anyone read selected poems by e.e. cummings . . .: this col(lect -ion o)fpoem(s), edi te D by Richard S. Ken ne dy, iswellcompos(ed. A w-o-n-d e-r-f-u-l-c-o-l-(-e-c-t i-o-n by th(e)poet'S B-I-O graph-er"
"Positive","Good deal: Tank works great easy to instal! Well pressure to house is just above 60 psi. Tank seems to be holding fine. only been 3 weeks."
"Negative","Historical Accuracy: The ""historical"" information provided in this book about women mystics is largely historically inaccurate. Some of the information is based on loosely gathered and incomplete information, which can provide misleading perceptions about the accuracy of the other content in the book. This book was provided to me by a fellow professor in the women studies department of a nearby university. The author seems well intended but basically wanting to tell a personal story rather than offer the reader a sound basis for self development. The book was a pleasant read, but for the more informed reader a bit of a disappointment."
"Negative","very cheap so bought it,later found d quality is also cheap lik its price: saw great reviews over here,was planning 2 buy it,but it got delayed.just yesterday ws goin 2 a party,so went 2 store as my eyeliner ran off.Was very excited to find this.Came home and tried,goshh,realised why they discontinued this product.It was not even spreading and i hav been using only pencil eyeliners since past 7years!!!blive me u dnt wana buy this cheapster ever!!!!"
"Positive","These socks are great!: I received these socks as a gift when my daughter was born. These are the only socks she wears that she cannot get off of her feet. Plus it is great that I do not have to put shoes on her feet since everyone thinks she is wearing shoes. They are a good quality sock. I have washed them many times and they still look brand new."
"Positive","GOOD JOB FERN: I am only half way through this book and am really enjoying it. it is easy to read and easy to follow. I am very impressed with this author, as I have never read any of her books in the past but am awaiting her ""Hide and Seek"" CD for my car and anticipate it to be just as good."
"Negative","Garbage: Patrick Robinson has really dredged the depths. He repeats his court martial scenerio of a single submarine (remember the president's son in previous books) as the climax of a plot that has china invading taiwan - give me a break! Poorly researched (Qantas is NOT spelt Quantas) and an insult to Australians (we do not say cobber all of the time) Definately the last time I will waste my time on this author"
"Positive","I liked it!: The only thing that would have made it better for me is if it had the actual scripture instead of an interpretation."
"Negative","This is an ""Essential""?: As much as I love Doc Watson, I fail to understand nor to appreciate this album. How can a Doc Watson Essential album exist without ""Tennessee Stud""? Go figure!"
"Negative","A Toothless Sequel: The nicest thing I can say about ""Jaws 3"" is that it makes me appreciate Spielberg's original 1975 classic even more. Everything about this movie is terrible, from the writing, to the acting, to the awful special effects. The movie drags endlessly, lacks any real excitement, and is poorly paced. What was Carl Gottlieb thinking when he co-wrote this film? And why would Louis Gossett, Jr. sign on to make a movie this bad right after his Oscar-winning role in ""An Officer and A Gentleman?""Most of the visuals look cheesy, and the fact that the film is set in Sea World doesn't help. In the fifties, most 3-D movies were pretty bad, with only the 3-D gimmick to attract audiences, and ""Jaws 3"" is no better. Even its 3-D effects are weak. This is one of the most poorly conceived sequels I've ever seen. Perhaps if you're an avid ""Jaws"" fan, you may enjoy this somewhat. As a fan myself, it makes me wish I were watching the original ""Jaws"" instead."
"Negative","This album is Jaded!: I first heard a few of these songs at a school dance. When the DJ put ""Jaded"" on, i thought at first it was a Matchbox 20 song~ surprised to find out that it was a lousy and overrated song from one of my favorite classic rock bands. Stay away from this, Rock band gone pop's album. If you want some Aerosmith stuff from when they were still good, get ""The Greatest Hits."""
"Negative","Sorry I bought This: Sorry I bought this radio. I have many SW radios. This one has very good fm and very good am. Thats it. Short wave is terrible, misetrable,weak ,stinks. Would not reccomend. Even with outside ant short wave stinks. Wisk I would have returned it."
"Positive","Good Toy: We bought this for my 2 years old daughter last Christmas. She has played with a lot. The sounds it makes are realistic and fun for her. The only complaint I have is that it does not have a refrigerator which would have been nice for storage reasons. Otherwise I think it is a good toy for the money."
"Positive","Reconocimiento: Después de conocer las bondades que ofrece un programa como el Star Ofice, se requería un libro que nos llevase a entender y poner en práctica las diferentes herramientas del programa. Con su libro Aurelio Mejía pone al alcance de legos y entendidos un libro que lo conduce a uno de la mano con absoluta claridad y secillez."
"Positive","""The cathedral is the Devil's!"": Over the years I've watched THE CHURCH a few times on my grainy old videotape and I always liked the film, but now watching it on this crisp DVD by Anchor Bay THE CHURCH really comes alive. It's like watching a whole new movie!Back a few hundred years ago Teutonic Knights killed a bunch of people possessed by demons, then built a cathedral on top of the mass grave. Fast forward to the present day and thanks to a guy snooping around in the basement the evil spirits are loose and causing people to do some unusual stuff like suicide with a jackhammer and making love to a 9 foot tall goat demon.The story is a little confusing at times and often funny (the typewriter scene had me in tears), but any respectable horror fan knows THE CHURCH is well made and worth checking out, especially the scenes with a young Asia Argento. Mmmm."
"Positive","Shields helps us to see the interior of a man as he searches: After having enjoyed Stone Diaries, I was surprised to find this focus on a man, a rather likeable one at that. Larry came across as a not superior man who struggled for recognition and had as much trouble with the opposite sex as one assumed only women had to face. His falling into marriage, disappointments, stresses remind one of an ordinary life, with the exception of his finalcareer swerve. How I envied his job at the florist where he seems happy and has a friend, who unfortunately leaves. How much one enjoys his honeymoon and then love of mazes. When he gets divorced, it's as if an old friend has been hurt. When he remaries, one is so glad that he has found happiness and also gets to see his son and maintain a reasonable relationship with wife one. As he seems so real, one wants life to work out for him - not just professionally. The ending party delightfully surprises and pleases."
"Positive","A key entry in the Delaware series: I am committed to reading all of Kellerman's novels, but honestly, the thrill has not been the same for the last few years - I felt like it was being phoned in.In this new book, we get some much-needed backstory on Milo and Alex - the characters popped back into life for me. Milo's early days in the department made for interesting reading.I did feel like there were too many characters involved in the ending, and I didn't totally get how the ending played out with who-did-what. There was no big ""Aha!"" at the end for me, but it was a satisfying story.Alex and Robin's relationship played a key role in this book, which was refreshing, as Robin seemed less like someone who drifted in from her workshop from time to time to have dinner and a few words with Alex. I do hope that we see more of Alison in the future as I feel like she would be a Significant Other character that would be more involved in the actual plot."
"Positive","awsome video: I only have five video's so far but this one has to be the most action packed and best yet,I've seen it over eight times! You don't even have to like anime to love this series. You must own it!But, I wouldn't recomend this series to anyone under eleven."
"Positive","Stay outta my Garden kitty!!!: I recently planted my nice little urban garden, it was then that I started noticing all the cats in the neighborhood instantly attracted to it. I needed a way to keep them out, they were coming in at all hours of the day.I purchased the scarecrow and instantly they stay away! Many a night I could hear the thing go off and the cats scatter back up the fence back to their own yards. My garden is left alone and if the cats are ever brave enough to hop back over that fence they get a quick reminder of why they shouldn't.The scarecrow works great! I was a little excited to get it set up and figured I was smarter than it didn't need the instructions, well many a test and many a shower I read up quickly over the instructions (which yeah are idiot proof - trust me..) and got it running.This is the best invention ever and worth every penny!"
"Negative","Disappointing: After reading the other reviews, I was looking forward to reading this book. Sad to say, I was very disappointed. I too gave up my child in the 50's and have reunited with him now that he's in his 40's. I was hoping for much more content on the feelings that the author experienced in reuniting with her son.Instead, I got pages and pages about family ""get-togethers"" in which the author went on and on about who was there (grandchildren, wives, daughters, daughters-in-laws, sons, husband, etc.).Moreover, being a professional writer, I felt the book was poorly written and needed a great deal of editing.Considering there are other books on the market for the same price that are 300% better (Primal Wound, for example), I felt it was money that could have been better spent elsewhere."
"Negative","Too much prose.: At the first time, I used this book as my reference in my networking area. But later I can not keep up this fully-prosed book anymore. At last, I had to change my reference book to another."
"Negative","Thank god some plants only live a summer: Boring. Predictable. Boring. Perhaps if TG leaves had hallucinogenic properties more interesting plot lines good have been developed. Maybe I am too critical of mediocrity."
"Negative","MOMENTS of fun!!!: I purchased this toy as a stocking stuffer. It was used once, and then it was never heard from again..."
"Negative","Stopped working after a month: My son used this in his car and it stopped working after a month or so. Seems cheaply made. Would not recommend."
"Negative","GROSS - see Reese Witherspoon in Freeway instead: These two movies are so lame and there wasn't much else in the theaters when they came out which helped the box office success. These are tacky stories and not going to encourage anyone to knuckle down and do what needs to get done to get into a good school. Also, show your daughter Penelope which Reese Witherspoon produced."
"Negative","how crappy can it get?: Cloverfield. New name for Central Park after some weird disaster happens. Not well explained in the film.That said, the actors were lame. Lamer than I've ever seen in any movies - and I've watched a whole lot of them. They were lousier than B-movie actors, if that is possible.The direction... was pathetic. Lousy. The camera was going all over the place, making it impossible to understand or figure out anything.When you do get to see the ""beast"", you can tell it's very (emphasis here!) badly done. Not credible.The dialog between the characters is unbelievably childish. No, let me correct this. Not even children would speak that way. I felt as if the script had been written by morons.To avoid at all cost.(Just because there was a huge promotional campaign about the movie, does not mean it's any good! This movie is just another ""Godzilla in NYC"". Useless.)"
"Positive","Six Days of Amazing Reading: Easily the best written, most detailed account of an Arab-Israeli war that I have ever read. Michael Oren does a phenomenal job of describing how and why the war happened, something I'd never been clear on, and in a very precise and detailed way provides a thrilling, frame-by-frame account of both the military and political machinations going on on both sides. Fascinating!! Oren's style of writing is easy to read and I believe most people will have a hard time putting this book down.I also found it to be a very even-handed account, I would think that even Arab sympathizers should also be able to see this even as Oren reveals the absolutely shameful and fumbling ineptitude of the Arab leadership at the time. Any teacher or professor of Middle Eastern studies would be wise to make this book required reading as part of their course materials."
"Negative","Natural Cure Ripoff: Kevin Trudeau is a scam artist. I am so disgusted with the book Natural Cures. Repetitive, redundent, riding on the coatails of others research and THEN to top it off referring the reader to his website where he wants to yank our chain for more money! He should be horsewhipped, tarred, feathered, and ran out of town. I am so mad. I have never before returned a book, but this one is going back. To have been limited in ""star rating"" and denied minus zero as a score was a frustration. I have a son with Autism Spectrum Disorder and additonal health issues. For several years I have utilized special diet intervention, vitamin and mineral supplements so I have done a considerable amount of reading into health issues and homopathic treatment. Trudeau takes advantage of those of us looking for alternatives to medication. He should be ashamed."
"Positive","Would order again: Most children love flash lights. My grand daughter (3) loved this crank light.She liked that it was very bright. Would order again."
"Negative","TH E MOST ANNOYING WOMAN ON EARTH: I'm sure this woman has lots of valuable info to impart, but we could barely watch this DVD. Sheri Bayles is sooo annoying and unfunny that we fast forwarded through the whole thing, trying to cling on to pieces of important information. Even the people taking the class seem embarassed for her. Avoid this DVD unless you think you can look past a nurse who thinks she's a stand up comedian. I wish I had another to suggest."
"Negative","SONY SUCKS: this model is the same as the mdr-v250 despite the new color silver....i have had 2 pairs of them which both broke. they have terrible sound. i dont reccomend them. dont over estimate sony's reputation...you want some good headphones, never buy sonys, they suck"
"Negative","not the best: I tried it but it was not the best for sure. Good graphics but not really realistic. It gets borring after ten min. I suggest renting it before you think about buying it."
"Negative","Fun as you want to make it: The theory of this game is fun, but it really is based on the 1960's game. The people in the video are from that era and the culture of the questions as well. It was fun because we all got silly about the questions, but an updated version would be awesome."
"Negative","disappointing: Not happy with this purchase. Water barely trickles down, but motor is too loud and that's all you hear. Appears cheap. I returned it."
"Negative","My cardscan paperweight: I used the 800c with my old computer and it was a reasonable unit to use. The software is not able to load onto my new computer. When I insert the serial number from the unit for registration to load software on the new machine the Cardscan registration says that it is not a serial number. Cardscan tech support will call me ""quickly"" I was told by customer service. They never called. Approach with caution."
"Positive","Mixed feelings: I am intrigued with the ideas presented in this book. Several of them are contrary to my idea of common sense and the traditional nature of my background. Some of them are very helpful to me I try to keep an open mind, take what I can use, and reserve judgement on the rest."
"Positive","Far superior to the movie!: This book was an excellent and enjoyable read. It flowed smoothly and was an unchallenging, pleasant and humourous read. I read it and then watched the movie. My advice would be to read the book and not bother with the novie; it has been seriously dumbed down for the sake of giving Meryl Streep more lines. The movie also loses much of the integrity displayed in the book which is quite thought-provoking on the subject of human behaviour in many areas, despite being light and airy in its approach. It does make you marvel at how materialistic and detached from reality some high-flying business persons really are. I felt happy to be ordinary when I had read it. Enjoy!"
"Positive","If you identify with Drew's life.Here's the background music: I bought this CD because I like the show, but I found it striking a chord and bringing back good memories with the good music. The soundtrack clips are tough to hear clearly at 55 mph, but the music is mixed at grade A quality."
"Negative","Horrible picture quality!: Room 222: Season OneDon't waste your money on this DVD collection. Upon immediate viewing you will notice that the distributor spent absolutely no money on remastering from the original television series. The picture quality is beyond poor. I was expecting quality equivalent to the Mod Squad series releases. I wouldn't even spend the money on a VHS version of this."
"Negative","Cute story but its been done: While I applaud the kid's efforts and see a fine writing future for him, I must point out that this book is a regurgitation of every other major fantasy series to date. If it were not in fact his parent's publishing company I doubt he would have been published. The story itself is cute, but the writer is young and needs many more years of polishing before he can reach the standards of those authors he's parroting in this book. It's quite sad that there is nothing new in this book. I had hoped for better."
"Negative","why does this have Rush in the composers credits?: I think someone was joking by putting the names of the band Rush into the credits on this.. Maybe Amazon should actually put in some description for it and indicate why Rush is credited?"
"Negative","Makes the A-Team look like Shakespeare: Imagine you are watching the A-Team on a small-screen TV. Now imagine that your are also watching a second TV (both small-screen and black and white), tuned to Battlestar Galactica. Imagine further that you are repeatedly striking your forehead with a brick, causing both pain and a substantial reduction of your IQ. You now have roughly reproduced the experience of reading this book."
"Positive","Love it: I brought this as a birthday gift to myself, one of the best gifts. It is the perfect size, easy to operate ( my son is 9 and he is taking wonderful pictures)"
"Positive","Works great: This item is great for games like Legend of zelda WindWaker, and Sonic adventure 2 battle, for gamecube, it offers alot of perks for those to games.A good buy i say."
"Positive","Love the Quotes: Book has great quotes for all ages. Bought one for myself and then got some for the grandkids. Then bought several more for gifts. Yogi was wise!"
"Negative","Shark Tale: Oscar is a fish who works in a ""whale wash"", like his Dad did. He wants to be a somebody, but without much money there's not much chance of that. In fact, he's in a bit of debt with the owner of the whale wash, and he ends up being tied up underwater, left to the sharks. When a shark looking to feed on him accidentally is killed by an anchor, Oscar takes the credit as a ""shark slayer"". Maybe he'll be a somebody then...""Shark Tale"" is pretty smoothly animated, but the plot isn't quite that engaging. Two and a half stars."
"Positive","This is a great book: This is an excellent introduction to Orthodox Christianity, especially as a comparison to Protestantism, and offers insight into why people are attracted to it (Orthodoxy). Someone said it could stand to have a few more footnotes, which I agree with. Yet, for his intended audience (Protestants), Matthew Gallatin does a great job of telling his own story of journeying toward Orthodoxy, and dispelling common misconceptions."
"Negative","Not very comprehensive: This book skips a lot of stuff. I would recommend Practical Visual Interdev 6.0 by Amundsen, I've had better luck with it."
"Positive","What a design book should be: Chuck Green's attractive, practical examples are brilliant--with styles that run the gamut from traditional to modern, friendly to serious. Always tasteful, professional, and distinctive.Non-designers will find them easy to copy. Professional designers will use them as inspiring and helpful building blocks.Green's consistent creativity and clarity make this a model for what design books should be."
"Positive","brilliant hardcore: The Angry Samoans are the apotheosis of thrash. They are accomplished musicians who write smart angry lyrics. This is a classic."
"Negative","Where's the original?: As has been already stated a lot of the 'new' footage leaves a lot to be desired. Fair enough Donner was aggrieved to have been removed from the film, but this version adds nothing to the movie itself or to Donners reputation. It is simply a marketing exercise to shift more Superman II units. The fact that Lester's original version is not here makes the whole package redundent.This is not the movie from your childhood as many touching scenes are missing and have been replaced needlessly. The new stuff isn't all bad, but the ending is unforgiveable! Imagine children today seeing Superman The Movie and then watching this for the first time. Two movies with the same endings!!!Pointless except as a curiosity."
"Negative","BULL CRAP....DOESN'T WORK... grrrrrrrr............: I own a brand new Nissan Maxima 2006 and it comes with a BOSE stereo system. I had a fm trasmitter before and it always has this static sound which is quiet annoying.I went to Staples today to do some window shopping and saw this griffin thingy and thought it would be cool!!I was SO excited and came back home immediately to check this thing out. I ran to my car and used this...and guess what, VOILA.. this piece of crap kept auto-reversing three or four times and my car spat it out :-(too bad.... UTTER WASTE.... DOES NOT WORK... DON'T WASTE UR MONEY..I'll be returning this the first thing tomorrow....boooo.. I don't know if they'll take it back cuz I didn't get the receipt!!Anyways, stand clear from this piece of crap... useless piece (...)CURRENT MOOD = MAD... VERYY VERYYYYYYY MAD!!!"
"Negative","TOO SMALL: Targus 10.5"" portable DVD player case is good quality but too small to accept even a 10"" DVD player."
"Positive","Nothing Wrong With This Development: This show would have to be one of the funniest shows that I have ever watched!!!! The acting is superb and the script you cannot fault.This show manages to be so politically incorrect although it doesn't appear overally offensive, it is mainly the characters stupidity that makes the the joke even funnier."
"Positive","The Last Whippoorwill -- haunting voice: The title cut of this CD is charming and delightful. Lona Heins' sweet, yet commanding rendition of this song is well worth the cost of the album. The other tracks will get your attention too, especially if you're a Gram fan."
"Positive","fun!: I won't go into a review of the story since the other reviews are so good. I will say that this a fun story with great writing. I look forward to more books from this author."
"Positive","Elas is a star!: Elsa, and her family have been forced to live at a Bed and Breakfast hotel. It isn't as nice as it sounds, it is actually a homeless shelter. Elsa's mum and stepfather Mack seem to be overwhelmed by the change in circumstances,and Elsa feel it is up to her to make life bearable for them,as well as her younger half sister and brother. This is a very tender book which treats a very grim subject with warmth and humor and realism. Elsa copes with her situation by telling jokes, and her footnotes introduce the reader to the differences in language in the US and England. Once again, Jacqueline Wilson and illustrator Nick Sharrat have combined to make a delightful story that will be enjoyed by the younger reader."
"Positive","Replaced old net: It was a sad day when I bought this net. It replaced one that was worn out after 20 years, three boys, and countless hours of seining. The new one is nice though!!"
"Positive","orange county: very funny movie i would see it again, colin hanks does a great job, i hope to see him doing another movie. this is a movie for teens but older ones like me would like this one."
"Positive","Informative and amusing: So, this is how the other half lives? A highly enjoyable read. If I should ever win the lottery I shall remember this book!"
"Positive","One of the best soundtracks of all time!: TRACK LISTING:1. Parador2. Madonna's Tango3. History Lesson4. Momma's Back5. Carnival6. Dictator's Workout7. The Part Of A Lifetime8. Flyaway"
"Negative","Decent content, but read an excerpt if you can.: This is dude-to-dude advice. It has a ""you got your lady knocked up / say goodbye to Monday night football"" kind of tone. I suppose in retrospect, it could be expected with the ""Man-to-Man Advice"" in the title.I did't need to be reaffirmed of my ""dudeness,"" I just wanted to read up on some tips to be the best dad I can be. The content may have been there, but I couldn't get past the cartoon of a tone of the writer.If you're a dude freaking out over being a dad, this could be a good book for you.If you're a man who wants to get some facts a dad-to-be should know without cutesy quips, check out ""The Expectant Father: Facts, Tips, and Advice for Dads-to-Be"""
"Positive","Essential reading,despite some picture flubs: The essays by the various expertts wh O WROTE THIS GORGEOUS CATALOGUE ARE FIRST RATE> The only flaw in the book seems to be the flipped or incorrect photographs. Many of the photos are so well described in the catalogue entries, yet the photos are wrong in their direction or of another object completely. Never mind this small gripe though... this hefty erudite tome belongs in every Mucha afficianado's library.. a book for amateurs and experts alike"
"Positive","Great Primer for Knowledge Executives: In case you didn't know it, if you run a business of any size, you are a knowledge executive. This book lays out the details of knowledge and its place in organizations. It also provides numerous case studies which give the reader a chance to see themselves in the Knowledge Economy.Great for employees, job seekers as well as owners, Knowledge Organizations gives all readers a sense of what knowledge is, how it can be nurtured at the organizational as well as individual level, and it shows us how business will be evolving in the decades to come."
"Negative","Oh - Zubin Mehta strikes again: I wish Amazon would show the honest reviews first (on top). What can be said? Zubin the butcher destroyed this wonderful piece, as expected. I am not sure how he made it but he has absolutely no sense of timing, phrasing, expression. And worst part of all - he has absolutely no clue how to conduct. So the recommendation? STAY AWAY FROM THIS RECORDING!!"
"Positive","These are great!: When you order multiple pants the same size, they necessarily aren't the same size. The three pair of these pants I ordered were all the correct size. Its great to be able to order Levi's 550 from Amazon."
"Negative","Disappointing: Disappointing. Not awful or anything, and certainly worth the bargain price I paid for it from a close out dealer here, but it was no better than ok. Small ok, you notice no caps. It covers a lot, which is ok, or even good, and understandable when it can't go into too much detail any one place. It's worth watching for a modest price, I'll probably watch it again sometime, but it will probably be a while, but it's not memorable at all. Visually it's not all that good either, it looks to me like a poor transfer from VHS, the video quality is not very good."
"Positive","Lo mejor !!!!!!: Es una Historia muy buena, aunque en realidad no es una novela o algo asi es mas bien un gion para una miniserie talvez no le guste a todo debido a la manera en como esta escrita la historia aunque nada tiene que ver con su trama es muy buena los personajes son bien definidos ambientes muy detallados, es el mejor libro que e leido de Stephen King, se trata en una pequeña isla esta apunto de ser asotada por una gran tormenta y antes de que esto suceda una anciana es assesinada y ahoran tienen que lidiar con un assesino que no saben si es un humano o no y es asi como comienza con algo tan tan malo que nisiquiera los isleños queiren saber...... bastante aterradora, interesante, muy buena se la recomiendo. cuando se lo recomende a una amiga que nunca lee novela por su propia cuenta quedo facianda y ahora ella es una fan del famoso autor Stephen King"
"Positive","Wonderful!: I got this CD today, and I can't stop playing it. Carmen has great talent as a singer, I don't know why she never tried another album! I have to admit, when I ordered this CD I thought it would be pop, but it is really more rap/hip-hop. The CD has 14 tracks, but really only 11 songs (the other three are very short ""segues""). The best song, in my opinion is ""Fantasia Erotica"". That song is amazing. I also like this CD because it is good fun music, it isn't too serious! Music that is too serious brings you down. This CD lifts your spirits. I would reccomend this to anyone who wants to hear great music, and it is a MUST-HAVE for any Carmen Electra fans! If you buy it, you will not regret it! (especially at the cheap price it's going for on here, $3.00!)BUY IT!!!!!!! Thanks for taking the time to read this review, and I am honored to be the first person to write a review for this CD!"
"Positive","I need a response from the Author: Hi, I love the book! But the cold cream recipe and the rose cream recipes have obvious errors in the quantities of ingredients. Example. The cold cream says it makes 7 ounces....then it says to use 12 ounces of beeswax and so on.....12 ounces of beeswax and the other ingredients do not shrink down to make 7 ouncyues. I tried it and made a big mess. I then tried just 2 ounces of beeswax and it was perfect. I need a response back from the author if anyone can help me. I really need to know now about the rose cream. I botched it up 5 times! with the directions given, but it's the only rose cream I could find anywhere."
"Negative","Sophomoric: Some funny bits. Largely junior high humor. Maybe if one was drunk ... (As it happens, the copy I got is also unpleasant to read since it's a musty, old used version.)"
"Positive","You thought politics was dirty? Wait until you read this!: Smokescreen tells the ugly facts behind what 'big tobacco' has done in this country and abroad. The book itself is a little dry; it reads a little like a documentary. However, what it lacks in style, it makes up with stunning facts and secrets from the industry. If every citizen read this book, the people of our nation would be screaming for a lynching. If you smoke, it may make you quit out of spite."
"Negative","Where is the Tablature Version?: The Canadian Amazon.ca seems to show the same book but as a recorded version. Is there in fact a tab version for ""Live at the BBC"" and what songs does it contain? Hopefully it is all cover songs as there are already many Beatles books with their own material. I am in agreement with the writer above 100%. If this book was in tablature and had all cover songs from the double album I would certainly buy it!"
"Positive","WoW is all i have to say: I am very satisfied with this product, I originally bought the Casio Exilim EX-Z75 witch I ended up returning cause it was made in china, I wanted a camera that was made in Japan so I found out that the canon sd750 was made in Japan so I bought it, love the camera it's small and very chic, battery is great!!!, screen is awesome!!! and all the Pics come out like you see in the screen, not blurry like the other reviews said, it is a great camera at a great price don't look any further buy it!!!"
"Positive","A Great Book of Comfort & Hope: This is a wonderful book that reminds us all that Heaven is an amazing place filled with love, laughter, and dancing. This book was given to me after my daughter, Madeline Renae, was born still at 37 weeks on May 31, 2006. The illustrations are so beautiful and it brings comfort and joy to my heart when I read the book and think of my daughter in Heaven dancing, playing, sitting in Jesus' lap, and reminding me how wonderful it is there. I recommend this book to anyone who knows someone who has lost a child as a way to reach out. I am purchasing additional copies to give away to others who have experienced loss."
"Negative","wrong parts: I order klein 601-6-inch insulatated cabnet and got klein 601-6 cabnet same screwdrive just not insulated you think someone would know the difference"
"Positive","exceed my expectations: my old norelco cordless finally died after 8 years of use so I had to decide on a replacement. since I don't really need a cordless, I decided on this corded model. it's a lot lighter than the cordless and shaves even better than the old one. it sounds like it's a little under powered but, it sure does the job. I have a full beard and used to have my 5 o'clock shadow by around 3. This shaver is able to hold me till the evening. It doesn't come with a carring case, but I just use my old one. Just as well."
"Positive","This is the best book ever made: The reason that I like this book so much is because it reminds me of my culture. Island of the Blue Dolphins is based on a real story. I think that is one of the main reasons people think it is a very good book. I recommend it to anyone because I'm pretty sure everyone will enjoy this book."
"Negative","Misleading, misrepresentation, one CD only not 4: This is misleading. Not the 4 disc set as described, just one 50 minute disc in French.Don't waste your time."
"Negative","Don't quit your day job!: ""Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out"" goes to show that tuning in after dropping out wasn't really an option for Mr. Leary. In spite of the cultural change he helped initiate, he didn't accomplish much after leaving Harvard to begin ""concentrating"" on the study of his own consciousness.Leary's work is not only childish and absurd, but lacking a great deal of substance from virtually every perspective. If it weren't for the true intellectual achievements of Albert Hoffman and Aldous Huxley, which show compelling arguments for the research of not only the drugs themselves but the effects on man and society, this era would look like nothing more than a bad trip to anyone looking back.TL;DR: This book is worth the read for an ""understanding"" of Leary's mentality, but its ideas should definitely be taken with a grain of salt. (i.e. Don't quit your day job!)"
"Positive","Awesome yet Gas causing: So these are really, really great and at 13 (or so) calories per piece, you can't really beat it. However, you will get gas and bloating when you eat these so beware!Also, the hardness of the pieces, while slightly too much, is not due to staleness but simply to how they are made."
"Positive","Works for me!: I have had great luck with my jump rope, and I've lost about 20 pounds since using it. My only complaint is that I wish it were a little longer, as I'm 6 feet tall.The weights have really toned my arms and back. Jumping rope with a weighted belt is the most expedient form of exercise I have found. I can fit it in, even with a three-year-old.I got into it after reading an articlethat many CEOs jump rope because it's fast, and the rope is portable. I also read that Madonna jumps 300 reps a day (it's surprisingly easy to work up to that number - you'll be shocked how easy!)."
"Negative","When it works, it's great, but poor hardware quality equals unhappy waffle lovers.: I got this waffle maker as a Christmas gift and we have been loving the waffles. Unfortunately, it stopped heating about a month ago. We have been tinkering with it to try and figure it out, but to no avail. I do not recommend getting this product. It is beautiful to look at and makes great waffles, but the quality of the product is sub-par."
"Negative","Shocked: looked pretty but unusuable..the glase is all cracked in many places..I may use it later for a planter and I will never purchase anything from Amazon again..I have been in ER and too ill to repack and return..and not worth paying someone to do that..I can take a picture with my web-cam and send that...probley a product of China...I should have asked..."
"Negative","not secure: I have a issue with a combination that can be entered in any sequence, basically a 4 digit code has 24 possible options to open it! It took me 5 min of playing around with it to open it not knowing the code, maybe I got lucky but the reality is I am not a seasoned criminal and clearly not comfortable leaving this type of box outside my home!"
"Positive","not impressed yet in connecticut: i recently stated that the gun had difficulties with 1 3/4"" nails on a reroof project, someone had suggested to stay away from the longer nails and i switched to 1 1/2"" nails.amazind difference!! gun sank every nail and never had a jam.dont know why they advertise it as a 1 3/4"" gun when it isnt. but know i know. guess i should have bought the stanley bostich"
"Positive","""Like this"" by Technotronic featuring Monday Midnite: Like this is breath of fresh air in the dance music world filled with meaningless Technobeat with no specific direction. This song brought back the good memories of the 70's by using a sample of the classic ""clean up the ghetto"". Monday Midnite's freestyle story about his experience at a London underground discotheque is unique and his succintly clear and distinctive accent is rare and I like it a lot. Plus, the song keeps you dancing till the last beat. Love it."
"Positive","bad, but good!: it was a bad movie, movie-wise. but the t-and-a was great. the movie will definitely leave you wanting to go to the beach."
"Negative","The book was great, this movie not so much: Nowhere near as good as the book. Nothing like it. You might like the TV personalities though. Still love Deepak though. Smart man."
"Positive","Great game, new silver case not as good as the old black box: I've always loved Pass the Pigs. However, the new design for the case is not a good design, in my opinion. I remember my old set being in a black plastic box. That thing was DURABLE! My family still has our old set at the house that we threw around as kids. The new design is cheap plastic with a clear ""window"" on the front. After about a year, I already have a crack in the top. I'm in the Army, and I bought this game to put down in my ruck sack so I can whip out Pass the Pigs to occupy my down time, and remind me a little of home. The game is still as awesome as I remember, but I'm just not a huge fan of the new case. As long as you plan on leaving this at home and treating it delicately, you should be fine."
"Negative","Poor Quality product: I bought this piece to add the capability of using my Incra miter gauge for crosscuts. I have found that the slots are not milled consistently, which causes loose areas along with tight spots. Even though the Incra is adjustable for width, it can only be adjusted for the tight spots which allows a lot of slop in the loose areas.If you are not concerned with accuracy beyond about +/- 2 degrees, this is an ok product. But using it to make tight fitting glue joints or 90 Degree cuts is impossible.I have reverted to the sled that came with the saw."
"Positive","healthy plus great taste: I was encouraged to try this product by sprinkling it on other foods, such as yogurt, rice pudding, hot and cold cereals. Benefit from the organic goodness Bob's Red Hill has to offer and give this unique product a try. The company offers the best of all organic grains. For those of us that love to bake their own breads, this is the only reliable source to go. Their customer service is full of ideas and enthusiasm for their grains, and the range they have to offer is excellent. Please give this company a try, and you will be like me.....purchasing them through amazon with automatic scheduled delivery. What could be better?"
"Negative","This DVD will make you dumb.: Hands down the worst official band DVD I've ever seen. The live performances are just collages with the studio version played over top. Then you got to watch these losers be idiots for what seems like 5 hours. I kind of liked this band before, now I have quite a different opinion. Buy this if you like absolute crap and to waste your time."
"Negative","Waste of Money: I am a professor of English language and have lots of dictionaries. But this one just flabbergasted me with its gaps and vague explanations. Some tables that are offered online and here at Amazon, are NOT JUST THERE. I would not give JUST ONE STAR to the item! I want everyone to stay away from this book and get the Webster Dictionary. Webster has everything and it reads as a fiction book or the World Almanac, but this Oxford Dictionary has no thumb index, the illustrations are of the cave age and many, many other disadvantages that will make you feel sorry and angry because you lost money the very minute you pressed the purchase button."
"Positive","Magnificent Achievement: Having been immersed in the study of Stravinsky at university, I have developed a new appreciation and love for this music and the man who composed it. To single out any one work or performance as the finest would be impossible, although certain pieces will need to be taken with a dose of salt as Stravinsky covers more than one style. My own personal favourite is the D major Violin Concerto at the end of the concerto disc- a brilliant piece of music brilliantly performed. If I had to point out what is not good about this album, it is really more a criticism of Stravinsky's work- the ""Cantata"" is probably the dullest thing he ever wrote (even he admitted not to liking it that much). Nonetheless, this IS his complete music, completely recorded under his watchful gaze. What a magnificent achievement- and how well preserved and mastered by Sony!"
"Negative","Dwarf Cichlids by david Boruchowiztz: I was very disappointed by this book. Vague and woolly. It didn't address the specifics needs for breeding Apistogrammas for example. Great pictures, but you can get great pictures free on the net. The quality of the photography is first rate and if you want a book just for browsing occasionally then its fine."
"Negative","Bad video footage: I bought this dvd because I had Trial by fire but lost it.This dvd has trial by fire but all the songs I like are missing like far beond the sun and black star.They are on live in Japan which is included but the way it was filmed really sucked.It made me sea sick just trying to watch it.The bad camera work ruined this dvd,dont order this,youll be sorry you did,"
"Positive","Celtic Music: Great Irish contemporary music. The harps, pennywhistles and bodhran drums make you think of the Irish countryside."
"Positive","great entertainment, but not for the faint at heart!: the only way to recomend this album, is to buy the version with ""Chocolate Salty Balls"" any other version will leave you with an empty feeling in your belly."
"Negative","Held my interest. Found the characters intriguing but sometimes got confused about who was who: I enjoyed the book but was having trouble keeping track of all the charactersInteresting turns of the plot. I would recommend this author to others."
"Negative","Bad customer service, item is not working: bad customer servicethe Item isnt workingtried to contact them with no respons."
"Positive","Farberware classic 10 inch frying pan: I've used Farberware for 40 years and have always loved their products. Most of my pots still look great after so much use. They cook food beautifully. The only problem has been with some of the handles loosening up after years of use. They can usually be tightened with a screwdriver, but after a long while, it's a bit more difficult."
"Positive","railway friends: I bought this video for my grandson who is 3 and who simply loves Thomas the tank engine and just loves Trains in general. The animated thomas video, Railway friends is Great!!!!its so nice to see the people move and talk and the train faces have expressions. He loves it. he loves the animation. we have to watch it everyday. I highly recomend this dvd for that thomas fan in your home!"
"Positive","Very Functional: I love this cutting board. Since it goes over the sink, it essentially expands my limited counter space. I also can push the inedible things (e.g. fat of meat, seed of colored peppers) off of the cutting board into the garbage disposal in the sink, saving me a step."
"Negative",".......?: Sometimes I ask myself why people bother to put out cds like this...don't buy it (read the reveiws and you'll know), however, Chris's new cd looks promising."
"Negative","Not THAT good..: I do not understand the rave reviews.Here is mine: Initially, good suction and power. Not great, just good. After the first couple of uses, the tiny conical filter gets clogged with dust. I have to clean it out EVERY time I vacuum and I'm only vacuuming about 700 sq ft of VERY low commercial carpet. If I vacuum twice with it, it will barely suck up a small blade of dry grass. Beating the crud out of the filter is a ritual prior to each use. The hose is a joke since it's only 6 inches long. Unless you have extension hose (not included) handy, you will not be able to reach many areas without lifting the cleaner itself. As stated it's a NARROW vacuum, maybe 10"" wide and just doesn't cut it. I've had this cleaner for about 4 months and am now about to buy something else. If someone wants this one, it will be at my next garage sale."
"Negative","A most contrived notebook indeed. Fail!: I'm a male reader who reads and enjoys romance. With much interest did I pick this book, only to disappointed. This book belongs to the garbage heap along with Waller, folks. The story is most contrived and shallow. There is (a) no chemistry between hero and heroine, (b) no humour, (c) contrived dialogues reminiscent of a grade three essay book, (d) flat descriptions of people, (e) mawkish melodrama being passed off as poignant drama. Take my advice, ignore the other '10' reviews and get this from a library instead."
"Negative","Counterfeit product.: The quality of these is not even close to the ones I purchase from a local retailers. The smoothing coating substance (blue) will pill off after a two-three shavings (none of the locally bought items have ever done that) while the blades become dull and start scratching instead of shaving. I've witnessed this behavior on several separate occasions / lots (silly me, should have gotten a clue from the beginning...)."
"Positive","Simply cant' beat this one: Having been around since the beginning with these guys, this maybe one of the best concerts I've ever seen period.The music is great and the vocals are out of this world. I figured it would be good but it was great instead. 5 Stars is reserved for Beatle music only, so I had to go with 4. Don't waste any more time and buy this one."
"Negative","Dont waste your time it aint as good as you may imagine: First of all i thought this was a good album. I liked the singles Gimmie the light and Get Busy but that was about it.I was under the impression that with 20 tracks and a good beat this may be a good album guess i was wrong cause these layed out songs will put you to sleep my advice is to not buy this load of crap and download the singles cause that is the only thing good bout this cd and this is the truth."
"Positive","50 Harbor Street: Loved the book about the continuing life in the small town of which I am very familiar."
"Positive","Great Album!: I love KT, all of her songs make me want to move and have fun anywhere I hear it. It's an older album, but definitely worth the time to listen to. Her songs will be stuck in your head, rocking out with your brain."
"Negative","Broke in less than 3 months: Very disappointed. I have only had the this coffee maker three months and the on/off switch has broke. Now, to get it fixed I have to pay shipping costs back to Cuisinart just to get a replacement. Not what I would expect from a reputed higher end item. Not to mention that my wife, a big coffee drinker liked her old reliable coffee maker and I talked her into upgrading to this nicer one. Things are not happy here this morning. After the fact I'm sorry that I just didn't go to a local merchant and let them deal with replacements, etc, if necessary."
"Negative","Whats worst: Pick one of whats the worst1. People who own this cd2. People who are trying to sell the cd used3. People who paid 16 for this cd4. People who listened to this cd all the way thru5. People who reviewed this cd. Thanks, Negative Reviewer."
"Positive","Funny cute lovestory!: I enjoyed the 2nd as much as the 1st! Bridgett is a bit more annoyingly stupid, but the movie is cute, and there's even more of Colin Firth.... to which I say hip, hip, hooray! What a fabulous actor. His character is so totally different from Hugh Grant's that sometimes Mark Darcy can seem really boring and dull. The love scenes with Hugh Grant & Renee Zellwegger were definitely much steamier than the airtime between Firth & Zellwegger.I don't know why this movie didn't do better at the box office. Our only comments negatively, are that the star, Renee Zellwegger did not look as cute as she did in the first movie, and she is perhaps even chubbier and less attractive, and sillier and bubble-headed. A very annoying character indeed."
"Positive","Trying to keep the cat awake in the daytime: Well, this video helps to keep our cat awake for a little while during the day (so he'll sleep more at night), but it is short lived. He's only interested in it for short times, say 10 minutes. If I don't show it for a couple of days and then start it again, he's interested for another 10 minutes or so. It is fun to see him curl up in his bed and watch the TV and he does, sometimes, dust the TV screen for me. His favorite is the pigeons, right up by the screen. Mouse squeaks would be appreciated, as would squirrel sounds."
"Negative","eh.: the fit is so weird, the straps kept falling off of my shoulders. however the material wasn't too cheap and it was for a beginner ballet class so i guess you get your money's worth."
"Positive","What a collection!: Richard just keeps getting better and better and better! When I listen to songs like Hazard and Streets Of Pain, I realize that he knows how to write different kinds of music. He is indeed talented!"
"Negative","Innovative: Is it real? Is it fake? The simple fact that this movie has blurred the line so effectively makes it successful in its purpose. When was the last time you saw a movie and actually had no idea whether it was real or fake? I believe this film is ahead of its time, and in the future we will be seeing more movies that will make us ask this question. This will be looked back on in twenty years as being the first. That being said, the film is completely unenjoyable on every level. Bonus star for originality."
"Positive","Disneyland Secrets, stories and Magic: This movie is great for any Disneyland Addict. Full of interesting facts about Disneyland through the years, rides that where to complicated to maintain and rides that have been retired, but they continue to think about bringing back. Also, includes a fun Disney trivia game to play and test your Disneyland Knowledge."
"Negative","Yes - But a huge caution if you travel internationally: This product is awesome in terms of doing what it is designed to do.The real problem is whether/how it works when you travel outside of the US. I travel overseas a lot and really need a white noise machine in busy city hotels. I have had two of these units literally explode after a few minutes of being plugged in (once in Germany, the other in China). In both cases I was using a travel adapter that all my other appliances work with.There are no warnings/instructions or guidance of any kind about voltage / currents / using while traveling. There is some cryptic note that talks about this being ""polarized like a table lamp"" which means absolutely nothing to me and certainly doesn't help re: travelSuch a shame that a good product made in the USA has incomplete documentation that doesn't think beyond our borders."
"Positive","Singing and clapping: my 14 month old son sings and claps to the video. my only complaint is that it's a bit short - under 30 minutes"
"Positive","This stuff is Fantastic!!: This product is all it claims to be and more. It is by far the easiest wax I have ever used! From the ease of application to the removal is by far the simpliest I have ever used. Even down to the smell (cinnamon), it's a joy to use."
"Positive","Great New talent: Los Lonely boys are one of the best new acts out to come out. Not since los lobos has a Latino group made such a great impact on rock and roll. They have their own unique sound, and I believe have a great future ahead of them I would defintely buy their next album, and will see them in concert some day when they get the chance to be in L.A."
"Negative","Poor layout: I was assigned this text for my biostatistics class. Unfortunately, it is a poorly designed textbook, as everything is 'backwards'. Rosner gives examples before he introduces the material; he derives formulas before giving the real equation to use.The only good thing about the text are the summaries included on the CD-rom. I have decided to read these instead of the actual text, because they are straightforward and leave out extraneous material."
"Negative","lesson in the depravity of man: As I opened this book, I thought to myself ""Wow! This seems like a great story!"" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember...."
"Positive","James Horner at his best!: If you liked the first version, you'll love this one better. Finally the score that i've been waiting for, better sound quality, remixed and all, nice booklet, everything you needed to know and hear about this amazing score. James Horner his at his prime, at a time when he was doing excellent scoring for movies such as Aliens, Krull and Star Trek III, this is the ""crème de la crème"". Although he was scoring this amazing music, you could hear a lot of different cues from one film to another, the originality was a little lacking but the orchestration and timing are amazing! I just wish they would stop putting special editions for his musical scores, (Aliens, Krull deluxe 2 CD's) and make it right the first time, there is a fan base for this kind of music. Star Trek II is a must for music or Star Trek collectors. A++"
"Negative","The Ultimate Matrix Collection Blu-Ray: I have had no problem with my high quality Blu-ray player except it will not play these discs."
"Positive","Great Customer Service: Arrived quickly and excellently packaged. DVD in even better condition than description. Very happy."
"Negative","Folding cot: We wanted to have a folding cot/bed for guests that could be stored without taking up too much room in the closet. We found it took two people to set it up and you had to be careful you didn't cut off your fingers doing it. The cot is large and VERY flat. No give to the fabric. Was not comfortable for one to sleep on being that stiff. If you put a plush pad on top it might help. One would want to pull this out for the guest you did not want to stay at your home too many nights. Must say it was easy to store in the closet because it didn't take up much space. Have since gone to an inflatable air bed for guests."
"Positive","The best available material from this master bluesman.: From a technical viewpoint of his guitar playing, Son House was past him prime by the time of these recordings. Even so, there was no one else who belted out the blues when he had steel guitar in hand and an audience in front of him. Alan Wilsons' harp adds texture to several tracks, and never upstages, but complements House perfectly.I claim that anyone who really listens to 'Death Letter' and does not get chills up and down their spine, has their very soul on vacation.For historical interest, I recommend comparing this set with the Library of Congress recordings on the Biograph label. Both the differences in the approach to the music, and the similarities of two compositions, are striking and well worth noting.This is definetly the place to start your Son House collection - the old man by some accounts was as old as 79 at the time, yet this was the first time he was captured on modern recording equipment, in stereo, no less."
"Negative","This movie was LOUSY!: After reading everyone else's reviews, I couldn't help but wonder if we had watched the same movie. Aside from The Ring having a completely incomprehensible storyline, it wasn't frightening in the least. About the only truly scary part was where, in the video, Samara comes out of the well and then comes out of the television and crawls, dripping wet, across the floor. Yes, I admit that part was scary, but nothing else about this movie was. I was very disappointed after all the hype because I haven't seen a truly good scary movie since ""The Changeling"" or ""Pet Sematary."" Damn...foiled again! But seriously, this movie is just a mishmash of funky images and eerie music that makes no sense at all. Blech...one star only, and only because of that one scene."
"Positive","Great live Sonny Boy II Performance: Great show by Sonny Boy. (Other CD's combine the nine sonny boy cuts here with the ones from the American Folk Blues Festival (with a band led by Willie Dixon) and the ones backed by the Yardbirds. Better choice, if that's all you're looking for. The Animals performances are good fun, but not indispensable. The last track is actually ""Going Down Slow"" by James Oden, best known as by Howlin' Wolf."
"Positive","another classic: GTR2 recreates modern FIA sanctioned sport car racing with sixteen real world tracks and dozens of cars. There is variable weather, night races, and a 24 hour endurance race option (time compression is available if you don't have the stamina for a full day at your computer). Online multiplayer is well implemented and there are numerous online racing leagues out there. There are literally hundreds of extra tracks, cars, and mods for download on the internet. GTR2 also makes use of the MOTEC analysis software just like the real cars (though the MOTEC program itself must be downloaded separately). Handling is quite realistic, graphics are excellent, and the program is very stable; I've run it on XP and Vista with no trouble at all. But your computer better have as much horsepower as your car, GTR2 is a resource hog."
"Positive","Wonderful Worship: The music and lyrics provide a great worship experience. Be careful with this in your car! You may want to lift your hands!"
"Positive","Daughter loves it!: My 2 year old loves her plush Buzz, Woody & Jesse! they even make it through the washing machine on a delicate cycle! Looking to buy Bullseye next."
"Negative","Dark with no salvation: Reading is, for me, instructive, uplifting, entertaining, or enlightening. To be dark without any of the other attributes feels like a waste of time. This book wasted my time. I already know how cruel humans can be, and how badly we treat the planet. I kept waiting for the moral to rise out of the ashes, but none did."
"Positive","Awesome: Look, Metallica, in my opinion, is the best band ever. call them sell-outs, call them terrible,call them whatever the hell you want, but they are my favorites. I like everything they've ever done, and will continue to follow them. They make awesome music and they are gifted musicians who play with heart and soul, and like to experiment. They are simply great."
"Positive","Audrey Tatou God Is Great: Enjoyable movie. I've always loved foreign films and with my region-free dvd player can purchase and enjoy them without obstacles. This is a fun film and Audrey Tatou is kind of an absent-minded but well-meaning girl who gets through life kind of haphazardly. Fun film."
"Negative","Not enough instructions.: I thought this product would remove red eye but it seems like it is nothing more than a green marker. I followed the instructions to touch the red eye but it left a green mark that just rubbed off the picture. If I left the marker on the spot long enough, it just turned the eyes white. Not impressed!!"
"Positive","DVD-R quaility OK: I hope the studio does a full blown release with features, while Kirk is still around to do a commentary track. However, the video quaility is excellent, No menu, no chapters and no frills."
"Negative","Included in the Nuvi 660 box: I ended up returning this item, because a carring case was included in the box when the unit arrived."
"Positive","Excellent product!: It is an excellent product, but it is hard to find my favorite color in the normal stores. It's worth the hassle of ordering it though. I get compliments on my hair color from people I don't know all the time. I use SPICE TEA with dark brown hair, It gives me red highlights!"
"Positive","Tan buena como la recordaba.: Si no compraste ninguna de las ediciones anteriores de la saga de macross esta es muy buena opcion. Despues de años de esperar un dvd de Robotech en español llega este, con una buena traduccion auque no la original,buena imagen y el exelente sonido.Exelente opcion para todos los fans de la serie!!!"
"Positive","It's like being at the concert: Having been to two of her Fearless Tour concerts (Phx, AZ and Los Angeles), I must say that this video really captures the atmosphere and experience of being at her concert. This movie also does a great job of showing what went into bringing this tour to life, and all the preparation that went into it.All in all, this is a spectacular film that absolutely captures the experience of being at one of her concerts."
"Positive","Minolta Dimage 7Hi 5.2MP Amazing: I am finally getting the pictures that I always wanted to take. I have been shooting 35mm SLR's for 20 years and I may never go back. I picked this camera up used 2 weeks ago and have just printed my second set of prints through a good camera shop. For the second time my jaw dropped at how wonderful the colors, and black and white for that matter, looked. The one thing to watch for when printing and this is with all digital cameras is the ratio size compared to 35mm. You will need to constrain the image a bit in a computer-based software like Photoshop or Paintshop pro to avoid getting part of your image. Simply use the marquee tool and set it to a fixed aspect ratio and the crop the image. Once you have gotten beyond this there is no limit to what you can do with this camera. Try the black and white on this unit also it really does a great job but you might miss the grain. This camera never leaves my side. Anyone want to buy an SLR?"
"Positive","Over a decade later. . .: I read this book when I was in middle school, and I constantly think about this book and the impact it had on me. It helped formulate my non-conformist attitude. And, without evening realizing it, this book sparked an interesting in Sociology, which I majored in in college. A definite must-read for young adults, in my opinion. I'll gladly put this on my bookshelf, and remember fondly for decades to come."
"Negative","SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMEN: BAD PICTURE AND ACTING. I WAS BILLED 4 TIMES AND ONLY RECEIVED 1 TERRIBLE FILM. PLEASE RECTIFY COST. AND PLEASE LOOK INTO COMPLAINTS OF OTHER COMPLAINTS I MADE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN LOOKED INTO, PLUS MY KINDLE THAT HAS NOT WORKED PROPERLY FOR 2 MONTHS AND NO ONE HAS RESPONDED TO."
"Negative","Not so good, but not a total waste: Brian Johnson's voice was practically gone by that time. Also, the production is simply horrible here.The songwriting is good, however, and would make for a good listen, except for the problems mentioned above.The fact is that AC/DC virtually died when Bon died. The guy was simply irreplaceable. He was the missing link that finally launched the Young brothers to stardom. Due to sheer talent, their momentum was so good, the inspiration at a peak, that BACK IN BLACK would have been a success with any singer, be it Brian Johnson or another. That they managed to record album after album after Bon's death, itás a tribute to their quality."
"Positive","A Wonderful Gift!: This is the best gift ever to give to new mothers and fathers, in fact they don't even have to be ""new"". It's also a great book to give to your child's teacher....every teacher should read this book to their students! Telling children that they were all born with these magnificent gifts will nurture their self-worth and remind them of their own goodness. Truly, every home would benefit from having this book. Children need to hear this message over and over again!"
"Negative","Turgid and rambling: This book is far too long for the few new insights it presents. The text meanders, the prose is turgid, it is almost painful to read (why use a short sentence when a long, rambling one will do?) and at times contradictory.I found his dwelling at length on the 'Golden Years' of the 50s and 60s to be Happy Days nonsensical reminiscence. This is an author past his prime. The book could have used a really solid edit before going to print."
"Negative","Meh: I know this is an indie film and I usually love those but this one is just so meh. I is just not a decent enough movie for me to recommend to anyone."
"Negative","The River: I do love this movie,The River, but I do not have a HD-DVD player to play them on.Could you please swap them for regular DVD. I will send back the one you sent me.hddvd"
"Positive","THE BEST THING SINCE A CALCULATOR.: I HAVE BEEN USING HAESTAD'S METHODS SINCE COLLEGE. JUST RECENTLY MY COMPANY BOUGHT WATER CAD AND SEWER CAD. WHEN THE BOOK ARRIVED ALONG WITH THE SOFTWARE I BEGAN READING IT, AS I GOT MORE INTO THE BOOK IT HAD EVERY QUESTION THAT I HAD IN MY MIND ALREADY ANSWERED. THIS BOOK IS THE MOST HELPFUL TOOL IN USING WATER CAD AND MODELING PERIOD. IF IT WAS NOT FOR THIS BOOK I WOULD HAVE TO GET ALL THE BOOKS FROM MY COLLEGE DAYS AND JUST READ, BUT THANKS TO THE ADVANCE WATER DISTRIBUTION MODELING BOOK,I ONLY HAD ONE BOOK ON MY DESK.IF YOU OWN WATER CAD OR NOT I THINK THAT THIS BOOK WOULD BE A WINNER FOR ANY ENGINEER. ""IT'S THE NEXT BEST THING TO A CALCULATOR""."
"Negative","Avoid this CD - very poor quality sound!: While this is a reasonable compilation of some of Ray Conniff's popular recordings of the 1960s and 1970s, the sound quality is absolutely dreadful.Sony Discos does NOT use the original masters for their compilations. In an effort to clean up the sound, they destroyed these recordings. They all sound bad but the strings on ""Nadia's Theme"" suffer the most.What is strange is that Sony Discos released an identical CD in 1996 under the title 20 DE COLECCION. Although that one had sound problems too, they were not nearly as prominent as on this collection. Why they tampered with the sound is anyone's guess.All of these songs have been released on CD with wonderful sound by Columbia/Sony. Avoid Sony's Latin label!"
"Negative","David Blaine - is bad for magic: I am a upcoming magican and I feel David lets down the whole team. His street magic he approaches people full on and most of the time frightens them. Yes his card tricks are very good, but the rest is nothing new. Now people like Darren Brown, engligh guy, are whats making magic more open to new people. Also the whole bit about not using camera tricks and then using them for the levelatation bit I felt let himself down greatly. It was a simple parlour trick any ten year old could do, I been doing it for almost a year now. I look forward to the guy doing some new stuff and making magic open to the general public agian...."
"Positive","Great Parody! (if it's possible to parody Madonna): Since Madonna is almost a self-parody, if it's even possible to parody her, Julie Brown pulls it off flawlessly. If you haven't watched Madonna's 'Truth or Dare', then 'Dare to be Truthful' won't be as funny - but it would still make you laugh.Cameos or fuller roles by Kathy Griffin, a very thin Donal Loque (as Shane Pencil)and Stanley DeSantis (you don't know the name, but have seen him everything) Even Wink Martindale isn't afraid to make an appearance and fun of himself.Brown does well with the send-ups of the songs too.Another pop culture piece that my friends and I quote 12yrs later (""you know I can't f**k for a week!""). And this is another video piece that should be on DVD (much less deserving stuff is!), but isn't."
"Negative","A little catchy, pretty disappointing: It's more grown up than her previous albums in bad way. I can't play a few of the songs with my kids around. While the inappropriate songs may be catchy, it's disappointing that they had to be so ""give it to me"". It's also missing the ""rap/yodeling/soul"" stuff that made me like her so much in the first album."
"Positive","penquin ice cube tray: Cute idea that I had sent along with the penguin tea timer, in case the recipient wanted iced tea. What could be cuter than penguin shaped cubes in an iced tea??? Great product (wish I could say the same for the tea timer, though)"
"Negative","Not recommended for runners: I was initially very excited about this product. It is very light weight and ostensibly ideal for runners. It's meant to be used by athletes. However, it has broken 3 times now, all when running. When I run with it, either outside or on the treadmill, it gives of electrical shocks! The first time, the shock was so strong that the whole player shorted out and I had to send it back to be fixed - it wouldn't play anymore! This was just one week after I got it. The second time, just the headphones got damages, but they had to be replaced, because no sound came through them anymore. This last time, the shock was so bad that half of the internal memory was wiped out, and it no longer supports the external memory card. I would not recommend this player to someone who is looking for something durable and reliable."
"Negative","replacement dog door: It was not the right one but we customized it to fit too much trouble to send back and would have cost way to much."
"Negative","Get ""Consuming Impulse"" instead: Consuming Impulse was one of the best late 80's/early 90's death metal records. Spheres was a later attempt by Pestilence to get ""progressive"" even with the addition of keyboards. Bleh. It doesn't work.Consuming Impulse is an absolute classic death metal CD. Get that one instead."
"Negative","Book fell apart within 3 months: This review is not about the content of the book, which was excellent. It is about the quality of the physical book. The book was shipped in excellent condition, although it was a softcover with black and white ink. The book started falling apart within 2-3 months of normal course use and by the end of the semester, pages were literally falling out of the book. I have never had this problem with any textbooks in either undergrad or grad school. And, I have used both hardcover and softcover textbooks before. Very disappointing purchase."
"Negative","Bad Business: I ordered the Deluxe Edition of the Gin Blossom's New Miserable Experience from this vendor.I received the standard version, wrote to complain, and haven't heard back for three days.I have never met a more irresponsible vendor online. Ever.Amazon should yank their vendor license before they continue doing bad business.Spend your money elsewhere or get burned."
"Positive","Keepsake: I enjoyed the book and it kept you interested because the answer to the guilty person was not revealed until the end."
"Positive","New Saga New Madness: This latest installment shows that the series isn't just a fighting mindless anime. This DVD finally shows off the intelligent aspect of Yu Yu Hakusho and also keeps its viewers on the end. 4 episodes of bliss... and i wont ruin what happens by blabbing about the synopsis. Pick it up YYH fans"
"Positive","Indulgent Fun: If you liked The O.C. you'll most likely enjoy Gossip Girl. While the show may be slightly unrealistic, ie how do high school kids get served at bars..., it is good entertainment. I can't wait until season 2 comes out on DVD."
"Negative","france forbidden: i cannot buy this item because of geographic retrictions.It is an electronic document, strange ?"
"Positive","A Powerful and Amazing Achievement: This is an amazing creation about Howie a 15 year old who is trying to come to terms with many issues in life (death of his mother, challenges of adolescence and trust in the people he meets along his journey). After watching this movie I found that it did an excellent job in presenting this and in showing how a fifteen year old can face the many challenges in life and move on. For anyone who watches the movie I would strongly recommend watching the commentary that is part of the movie by director Michael Cuesta first and then sit back and enjoy the actual movie. Overall, this is something I strongly recommend seeing."
"Positive","used book: used book in good condition. It came with the cd's- great value for the price! So glad I found this one!"
"Positive","The Don Quixote of submarines: I'm Irish and live for some years now in Berlin. On a recent trip to Ireland, I came upon this book in a bookshop. I enjoyed reading it so much, I ordered a copy of it through Amazon to be sent to my eldest son who lives in the USA - I wanted him to read it, but I didn't want to give away my copy.This is a great story. I always enjoy a well written history book, particularly because a good one can take a potentially boring subject (history!) and bring it to life. Monturiol is the Don Quixote of submarines, and I really felt for him and his band of dreamers as he followed the call of his quest.Next step for me is a plan to some day go to Barcelona and see the remains and replica of his submarine.There is a quote I heard somewhere; 'A man's reach must exceed his grasp, or what's a Heaven for'. So is it with Monturiol. But in writing this book, Matthew Stewart never fails his reader.Read the book and enjoy."
"Positive","Negative Review Correction: I purchased 2 201 replacement filers for $49.95 each and thought I could purchase them at 3 for $66.00. I was mistaken, the 3 for $66.00 was for a different series Blueair filter. Other than my error in pricing I think the Blueair filter system is very good and it runs so quiet that I don't know its on."
"Negative","Get a Table: The Logitech Wheels, this lap attachment was built for, are great (especially the pro wheel I own). Unfortunately the same can't be said of this attachment. The attachment is simply too small for any normal sized adult to use, and it's uncomfortable needing to clamp onto the middle pedestal while accelerating and braking. The end result is that your wheel controller is so unstable when you're turning that it feels like it's about to fly off your lap. Logitech should have never released this piece of garbage.There is a good reason that you don't see this product in many retail stores. Unless you're buying this for a small child, save your money for a small table instead."
"Negative","Inaccurate outdoor temperature readout.: Since I live in MN, I took the extra effort of obtaining the more expensive lithium batteries that work better at lower temperatures, as suggested in the product information. Outdoor temperature read consistently 6.5 degrees higher than actual temperature. I called La Crosse and they had changed their recommendation to standard alkaline AA batteries for the transmitter. Transmitted temperatures are now only 3 - 3.5 degrees higher than actual. Still not very accurate. On the positive side, the projected readout is sharp and entirely bright enough."
"Positive","Fantastic journey into the composers mind.: William Alwyn has captured pure beauty in his music. The Pastoral Fantasia embodies much of what Debussy tried to capture in his music; sunsets, trees, waves, clouds, and all that represents beauty and majesty in the natural world. The quality of this CD is excellent, just make sure you play it loud and with maximum bass capability! It will touch your soul."
"Negative","Missing Third Year: I received the ""complete"" set for Christmas and was watching it in order. To my dismay, there were TWO sets of Year TWO and NONE of Year THREE. What a disappointment! Because I've opened years One and Two (1 of them), I cannot return the entire set. VERY disappointed to discover that I can find NO CONTACT info to be able to ask for an exchange of one set of disks for the other... Venting, here, doesn't get me Year Three, I know but it will serve to warn others."
"Positive","Rebok Men's Classic: Great service and a great price. Have purchased this product many times from retail stores at a much higher price. Transaction went perfectly. Receive product right on time. Very satisfied. Would recommend this vender for price and quality service."
"Negative","Ugh: I picked up this book at a bookstore because I needed a book to read on a 6 hour flight and had already read all the Mary Higgins Clark novels available. Hoping that writing talent was genetic, I picked up this book. Quite frankly, it made me want to jump out of the plane. MARY HIGGINS CLARK FANS: do NOT assume that just because CHC is the daughter of a brilliant writer that she is a brilliant writer herself, because her books are shallow and awful. Terrible plot, terrible storytelling, and the ""mystery"" isn't mysterious at ALL."
"Negative","Disappointing: This book does not supply the credible witness regarding the ""luminaries"" that I'd hoped for: i.e., marking time by the stars. It has plenty of curiosities.---------------------I'm not one much for reviewing political, religious or other controversial subject matter. I read some of it but don't care to be categorized simply because I want to know what's out there. On such material, I'll likely give 3 stars since there's not a no-comment option."
"Positive","puzzled: Splendid Sci Fi. Like some other readers I thought that the moral concerns over genocide were utterly pointless. If you are facing a powerful enemy bent on your complete destruction, one that attacks without reason, and with whom there is no possible negotiation, you have only two options: kill or be killed. If you are still alive afterwards then you can suffer moral pangs and engage in feelings of guilt in whatever degree you see fit. In any case it wouldn't have been genocide since that race was firmly established on the second and still shielded solar system.My problem is the title. What does it refer to? Who or what is the Judas? How or why is this Judas chained and then unchained?"
"Negative","See Frank Black, not Eve-6: Basically, there is no reason to buy this CD with bands like Eve-6 and Weezer covering, it should have been punk/hardcore bands like the Smiths tribute. do yourself a favor, buy pistolero or go see Frank Black play (last show in Philly, he played Wave of Mutilation. very cool....) And besides, it couldnt have been a real tribute without UMASS?!?!"
"Negative","Do not waste your time on this book: This is a horribly written book. Plain and simple. I read the first book, enjoyed it, despite the fact that it was a bit on the predictable and pulpy side, and thought that the second one would continue the fun. I was disappointed, that's for sure. Whoever edited this work should be drawn and quartered, I could not go on after 134 pages of this swill. Same words repeated 2-3 times on the same page, not acceptable. Not to mention the incredibly annoying back-and-forth of the two wizards and their irritating information-hiding from the main character.In a word - crapola."
"Positive","Bought this as a gift.: I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. I don't really listen to Clutch so this review won't be helpful to many but he loved it : )"
"Positive","A great book to snuggle up with...: unless you happen to be a fan of Snuggles, the fabric-softening bear...in which case I wish you'd reconsider a career in advertising (there's enough evil in the world without more Snuggles out there pushing packaged goods). The greatest compliment I can give the book is that I couldn't wait to put it down and pick up a pencil. Anyone who's ever thumbed through an award annual knows Sullivan can write a great ad. Now he shows he can write a book to help the rest of us write great ads. With his advice and a little luck, I hope to put a pretty good book of my own in front of him someday."
"Negative","More questions than ever...: I read this book because I am also looking for answers After completeing the book, I have a question. How can you believe Angels guided the writing of this book, and doubt they guided the writing of the Bible?"
"Positive","A gifted writer, but needs more seasoning: Being a fan of his TV show on the Food TV Network, I hungered for more of Anthony Bourdain's crude wit and harsh tell-it-as-it-is personality. Kitchen Confidential starts out with pure Bourdain attitude and fed my hunger satisfactorily. However, the latter half of his tell-all tale of the restaurant biz fell apart with random stories which don't tie together well with the book overall. Despite the roughness and poor editing of the book, I found it to be an enjoyable read. Bourdain does a good job telling his self-aggrandizing life story, but leaves out his wife almost entirely! Given his character, career obsession, and drug use, I'd like to know more about the woman who stands behind him and puts up with his horse [dung]."
"Positive","Smooth and Sexy: Raul Malo has scored again with ""After Hours"". You don't have to be a country music fan to love this album. With his magnificent voice, Raul and his fantastic band comprised of Robert Chevier on piano, Jay Weaver on base guitar, and Tom Lewis on drums, have once again produced a record worth listening to. Following in the footsteps of the greats, Sinatra, Martin, Orbison, and Elvis, Raul and his band have created music that's smooth, sexy, and will definitely put your husband, wife, lover, partner in the mood. I've ordered multiple copies for all my friends. Don't miss this opportunity to sway with the master, Raul Malo."
"Positive","50 cent iz off the hook: yo you need to cop this album if you are a true hip hop fan because the cd is amazing. every single track on the album is off the hook. i aint even gonna say no more, just cop the album"
"Negative","Redundant Failures: We barbeque often, 12 months per year, using rotisserie 4 to 5 times a month. Despite the Weber name, the accessory rotisserie was obviously an import with a very cheaply designed gear motor. The first one lasted about three months. The first replacement ran for about 15 months before you could hear the bearing rattling and the gears starting to whine before it died. The final replacement has lasted about two years. The instructions on the third one advised that the unit be brought indoors when not in use. We did that with the first two as well, though we weren't informed it would be advisable to do so.Our final word is that Weber should make quality control a top priority on source out products bearing their name..."
"Positive","Perfect for summer days: I was looking for an inexpensive watch to wear to the pool and while doing work around the house.Pros- easy to read, nice size for smaller wrists, classic styleCons- as pointed out in other reviews- loud and rough craftsmanship on band. I took my wife's emery board to the jagged points and it was fine.For twenty-six dollars I thought it was a great watch."
"Negative","Sima quick connect: This item is functional, barely. It's OK for use with a lightweight camera and standard lens in horizontal position only. With a longer lens and/or vertical position this plastic unit feels underbuilt with a sagging problem in the vertical position. Spend a few bucks and get an all-metal Bogen product, you'll be happier."
"Positive","Very nice: This is an extremely well built product. Works for automatic trannys on dodge neon. Fit perfect took about 15 minutes to do everything myself. Definately worth the money no question!"
"Positive","Great Australian Comedy Classic!!!: This is a great Autralian Comedy Classic featuring the oversexed Alvin Purple.It's a must see that hopefully will be on DVD!!!!!!!!"
"Positive","A first for Danielle Steel: I really enjoyed the beginning of this book but as I continued reading it I was amazed as to how the story was developing. I love the books she writes that take you away into this wonderful love story between characters but this was very different. I enjoyed reading it but you have to really open your mind to accept this book as it is so out there. It really is a high-tech love story to the 9th degree. If you enjoy the way her books take you into another world then read this one even though it is not one of my favorites like ""The Ring."""
"Positive","Lots of Great Guitar.: This was a great era for the electric band. I really like this show, especially the instrumentals ""Embryonic Journey"" and ""Water Song."" Very energetic ""Big R&R Blues"" too. So many highlights. This is a show worth owning."
"Negative","Unfortunately Not Pleased: I have to say that I am not satisfied with this album. I was hoping for a lot of upbeat, catchy tunes like ""A Thousand Miles"" but was let down. I agree that she can play the piano beautifully and has a great voice but the songs just aren't that great. Michelle Branch's album has more great songs on it than this one."
"Positive","Coming Soon to an Elevator Near You: This is one of the most relaxing LPs I've ever heard--every song finds a relaxing groove, and then it's nap time. Love it!"
"Negative","Bland, disappointing: I've been a fan of Johanna Lindsey for many years, but this isn't one of her best books. The plot is weak and wanders frequently. There is a great amount of repetition, also. It's almost as if Ms. Lindsey experienced writer's block and chose repetition as a way to help her add more pages.The characters and the dialogue were terribly dull and simplistic, as well. The book reads as if it was written by an entirely different author. What happened, Johanna?If you must read this novel, take the advice of a previous reviewer and borrow it from the library. Don't waste your hard-earned money."
"Negative","Absurd premise, unlikeable characters: I had quite a different reaction to this book compared to other reviewers. Before the premise even revealed itself, I found the description of the romance corny -- along the lines of a bad movie on the Lifetime Channel.And, without giving too much away of the plot, let's just say I am an ear, nose, and throat surgeon and I can tell you that the author did absolutely no medical research for the veterinary/surgical portion of the book. The last straw was when one of the dogs supposedly had a laryngectomy (larynx removed) and had nothing more than a band-aid on its neck. Even if you ignore the fact that it takes 5 years of surgical residency to learn this procedure, once a larynx is removed a tracheostomy is required or the animal would not have an airway! Come on....put a modicum of effort into researching for your writing."
"Negative","The product is good but the company have packaging and storage problems: I bought this item for a lady who has stage four colon cancer and recently paralyzed. When I received it, the packaging was confusing because they used an unrelated product carton (a used baby diaper box). Then, 2 of the 4 plastic bags were broken (have small holes), when the nurse opened them, she found cockroach eggs on some of the diapers and some were inside the bags. She showed them to me and uses a trash bag to sealed it and throw it away. I had to vacuum the carpet afterward because some eggs were dropped onto the carpet when she opened it. The patient used up one bag (22 diapers) and she likes it; I think the product itself is good. But today, I opened the last bag and found cockroach eggs again. I took a picture of one of the diaper that has cockroach eggs on it and I happen to see Amazon's request for reviewing this item in my e-mail today, so I decide to write this review. I'm very disappointed."
"Positive","Good value, good looks.: The watch is just what we wanted at a good price. It arrived just in time for our granddaughter's birthday. She loves it."
"Negative","State Fair Bingo: not satisfied with purchase, game board is not complete, it contains twoidentical pieces instead of the correct one. Was not listed in description.Would not buy from this person again."
"Positive","Adidas Women's 3-Striped Gym Tank: GREAT PRICE. Nice fitting, fits to size. Compliments nearly every body shape. Easy wash/wear. I wish there were more colors available at this price. I would recommend to friends."
"Positive","Good book, could have lived without the preverted sex scenes: This was a good book, I found it and enjoyed it. But being a 12 year old, I thought the sex was unecessary and made me uncomfortable."
"Positive","Headbanging stuff: Considering the direction that Gillan went in his solo career - his music made Deep Purple look rather like a kitten. Gillan is still in dynamic vocal form here and singing with wild abandon - by the time he'd re-entered Purple in 1984, his voice was somewhat neutered. Nevertheless, this is heavy bombastic stuff. Everything else about the music has been said here, but I'd like to add: what I like about these reissues is: a) the extra tracks and b) the liner notes by Gillan himself and others. Well packaged!"
"Negative","not what I thought: Her explaination of the moves were good, but I was looking for something more repititous..more like an ""do it with me"" instruction and not a ""here is what to do""(only one time)I learned what I had to do, but I didn't have the creativity to put something together with just the few moves she showed me.I think something more like a ""workout"" bellydance would be good for me....then at least I could get a ""real"" feel of what I was doing."
"Negative","Not just a children's book!: I'm appalled by some of the more literal and snotty reviews for this wonderful book, which is for all ages; I bought this for Paul, my same-sex partner, on Valentine's day several years ago. It's not about competitive love, it's about unconditional love. What appeals most is that the relationship between big nut brown hare and little nut brown hare is never defined, nor does it need to be.Paul, the love of my life, died last week, and I am reading this book aloud at his funeral.BTW somehow the 1 star above appearred & isn't my real opinion - it's 5 stars all the way."
"Negative","made from toilet paper...: The quality is really poor, I would clean my hand after reading and I will never eat apple while reading it."
"Negative","Weight Capacity Rating is Misleading, COT Fails: I was impressed with its seeming sturdyness and construction at first when I received this cot. I purchased it as a result of its weight capacity of up to 600 pounds. I am 450 pounds and after an initial test, which it passed with no problem, and then one whole night of sleep it failed on the second night of usage.Let me be clear that all I did with this was lay on it and while sleeping shift my body position as any normal person does during the night. The middle leg on the bed collapsed. I originally recomended this item, but now I give it a 1 of 5 stars since it would have likely failed with a person of average weight after a longer period of time."
"Negative","The most brainless CD ever: I think Tori Auntie has lost her spirit of defining the concept of space and time in her recent CDs...Including this one...you will get numb at first and get upset at last."
"Positive","shoes: a great pair of steel toe shoes. It is more comfortable then wearing steel toe boot for working 12 hour days"
"Negative","SLICED AND DICED, BLOTCHED AND BUTCHERED!!: WARNING WARNING WARNING!! This is a four episode, Reader's Digest style condensed version of the 13 episode original video animation from Japan! They took out all the good stuff and the good music and you can't even follow the story! Get the imported stuff from eBay or the new three volume DVDs from Amazon! The bottom line is... WATCH THE ORIGINAL FULL 13 EPISODES AND NOT THIS SLICED AND DICED AND BUTCHERED VERSION!"
"Positive","Not a bad deal!!!: I bought my set around June of 2006 and have had little to no problems with the refurbished set. The only problem i had with the refurbished aspect is that the sets stand did not sit level;so i have coasters on one side of the base stand and you could never tell. You can't beat two HDMI inputs and the picture quality is great,even with analog cable. The X-Box 360 looks perfect. The sleek look of the T.V. is just cake. The USB input is cool being that Philips creates fixes for bugs that where apparently wrong and you can view pictures if you do that. I did have an issue with Philips customer service. I bought a Philips upconverting DVD player and the remote for the T.V. was not compatible with the Philips player. How is that? I don't get it. In conclusion i don't see how you could get a better deal. Especially it now costing a mere 750 bucks."
"Positive","Most Wonderful Book Ever!!: I was on 8 different medications for various health problems. After reading this book, I was able to get off ALL my medications one by one! The power of positive thinking is truely amazing. Thank you so much Daya for writing this book and enlightening the world!"
"Positive","Maniac Magee is sad and exciting book.: Jerry Spinelli is great at explaining the actions of young Jeffrey Magee. Jeffrey's parentsdied when he was just a little kid. He was sent to live with his Aunt and Uncle, who do not have a real loving relationship. So, one day, he runs away. This book tells about his adventures through Two Mills, a prejudiced town. And his adventures with the Beals, McNabs, Grayson, and Pickwells, as he searches for a home."
"Negative","Replacement Filter: We are disappointed to discover that this Delonghi replacement filter is not exactly the same as the closely pleated air filter as the one that originally came with the air purifier."
"Negative","terrible: The answers to the mysteries referred to events that weren't even in the text. It didn't make any sense."
"Positive","Recorded at Miklós Rózsa's country: An expanded suite, of BEN-HUR, with two pieces not available, in other versions. 23 minutes of magnificent music from BEN-HUR, plus SPELLBOUND concerto."
"Negative","...""we could not tolerate the cruelty associated with a meat-eating diet and we wanted to help end animal suffering""...: THIS IS THE #1 REASON THESE TWO LIST AS TO WHY THEY WROTE THIS BOOK.And it shows. Yes there are some interesting points made about artificial sweeteners and good carbs vs bad carbs...but over 66 pages in this 198 page book (then you hit the sources) are devoted to WHY YOU SHOULD BECOME A VEGAN and a rant on how the government is deliberately ignoring how we are being poisoned ...and then another 36 pages are daily menus, etc. so you can correctly become a VEGAN.This book was cleverly written - and parts of it are really funny. But if you are looking for a real diet book...and really don't intend to become a Vegan...this book is not for you."
"Positive","Dreaming of You ~ **Selena**: I loved this album. I do own it, and i suggest to anyone who is a Selena fan to purchase a copy. Though i haven't purchased any of her other cds as of yet, i hope to do so in the future. This album has some really tear-jerking, heart-warming songs. ""I Could Fall In Love"" , ""Dreaming of You"" , ""Baila Conmigo"" , ""Wherever You Are"" , ""Como La Flor"", ""Amor Prohibido"" , ""Missing My Baby"" and ""Bidi Bidi Bom Bom"" are some of the many of Selena's hits that are contained on this album. BUY IT! AND ENJOY!"
"Negative","Better books out there: And there certinly are better books out there on Air Force One. Most notably, the Jerald F. terHorst book The Flying White House, which is unfourtunatly out of print, but get it if you can. Chitester makes an attempt at giving the reader a look into what goes on with the presidency and Air Force One, but instead gives the reader a boring, ""tour-guide"" feel to the book that seems as redundant and glossy as a DisneyWorld host. Chitester's book never gets off the ground, and when reading, makes one feel like air-sickness isnt such a bad idea."
"Negative","Not a very effective product: Not very well made nor designed. One side has a very flimsy cover which you can see the grey foam rubber waffle pattern through. This is the side you sit on, because the other side is a weave of grippy rubbery stuff that holds the cushion in place. Sitting on the waffle grille side is not very smooth -- I can find no evidence of any ""gel"" utilized in this product at all -- it is merely an open gridwork of pretty soft rubber with a flimsy cover. It is easy enough to compress the grillework between your fingers, so sitting on it flattens it out pretty quickly. Look at the picture with the cover peeled back -- that's all there is to it. It's really not a premium product and is certainly not worth the $60 Amazon advertises it for by another supplier. With shipping, this item came to over $40, and it's just not worth it in my opinion."
"Positive","Beautiful little book: Beautiful little book with positive meditations to begin or end your day! A joy to read on a regular basis."
"Negative","Too much petty bitterness; not enough meat: I agree with reviewer Bruce Novozinsky. If you're fascinated by Jack Germond, the person, or if you like reading gossip, then you may enjoy this book a lot. If, like me, you hoped it would provide real insight into politics and journalism from a sage Washington journalist, you'll likely be disappointed. Germond comes across like an Archie Bunker of the left, bitter, boring and repetitive."
"Negative","Not Up To Par: The author must be using a ghost writer these days. The book was not anywhere near the quality of past books. Characters were shallow and scenes were redundant. I kept hoping it would get better, but never did."
"Positive","Great quality: My three yr old loves this product. The food velcros together nicely but still easy for her to cut. Great buy."
"Positive","The Best 50 Biscotti Recipes: Comprehensive list of biscotti from sweet to savory. Biscotti isn't just for dessert! The combinations are interesting and I especially like the textureful No-Guilt biscotti with no oil or butter that includes whole wheat flour and bran. Also, wonderful triple ginger and the delicious and not too sweet Tuscan spice and almond. Many of the savory ones are good served with soup."
"Negative","Be Prepared: Item installed in '05 Dodge Ram 1500. It would only work in one not so conveinient spot on the steering wheel. It also will not work if there is direct sunlight on the receiver. BE PREPARED for possible disapointment. I was."
"Negative","6 month watch: We have gone through 2 of these watches and we will now move on to another. First watch lasted 1 year, second lasted 6 monthes. Not a long term watch for sure.Update March 27, 2012: After purchasing another 2 watches, they have crapped out yet AGAIN after 9 months. We are officially moving on to another style, too bad, the boys liked these :("
"Negative","Long Line: I ordered this game Sept 2006. Was the line I was standing in really this long? Was this the bonus part?"
"Negative","Will cost you more in the long run: I loved this printer at first. I thought the ink was cheap, and it seemed reliable. After a couple of months, I found out that it has counters on the ink cartridges, and counts the total number of pages you print, and gives ink status messages based on that. We do almost exclusive black and white printing here, and it still eats color cartridges like crazy. When you factor in the cost of a color ($20) and b&w ($10) cartridge, you are paying $30 to make black and white pages. Not happy. Selling this as soon as I can, and getting a different brand. Also, there is no way to refill the ink, like with other brands (hp, etc.). Their ""cheapest ink"" will cost you more in the long run. Don't buy this printer!"
"Positive","One of the best: This book is all you need, beyond the bible, if you are seriously interested in divine healing. It should be noted that this book is written by someone who was very successful in the healing ministry,as distinct from those who merely theorize. This is an excellent book!"
"Positive","Great UnLocked Phone!: Great PhonE works every where i have been with great reception! you just can't send pics or get them in mail but thats okay!"
"Positive","additional telephone handsets for panasonic: excellent service....i had a hard time finding additional handsets for the master tel i purchased in 12/03. shipping was right on time and quick. would deal with them again.."
"Positive","Awesome fantasy adventure Blu-ray: I absolutely loved this film when I saw it in theaters, so I knew I was going to love the Blu-ray. The films visual effects are meant for high-def, and it just looks and sounds fantastic. The film itself is an awesome darker update of the classic fairy tale, and it's put together and played out quite well. The setting, the music, and the acting all have a lot to admire.Source: criticnic.com 3-October-2012Disclosure: Film sent by Universal Home Entertainment"
"Positive","Could Be Better: This game is pretty cool and has great graphics but you onlyget to fly three ships (unless you have codes, then you can fly DarthMauls infultrater), and most of the levels are not that complex, butit's still a good game. Regardless of what you may have heard, thecontrols are fine and the game has a few bonus levels and twomultiplayer missions to unlock. The following are some good pointsabout the game: great graphics, good action, several different kindsof levels including bonus levels,fun to play, even after you beat it,and if you can unlock it, Darth Mauls infultrater rocks. So over all Iwould say this game is good but could be better..."
"Positive","Eww ick!: Men kissing each other! Icky! Run away! Run away!All right, now that all the children are gone, I'll say that if you don't mind a well-written, well-acted, occassionally depressing science fiction series, then this second series of Torchwood is well worth watching. Yes, it's intended for adults, so it's got a little gore, a little violence, and some swear words you don't normally hear on American TV. Sex? What sex? You see Jack kissing a couple guys (in seperate episodes), and Tosh in bed with one man after sex and another man before (in seperate episodes). No nudity."
"Positive","A must have!: This is a must have for all Bumbo users. I wish I had it when my Daughter used the bumbo, but now I have it for my new baby."
"Positive","Bin: Its very good product with a cheap price. I test it,and use it for awhile, there are any problem with that. Sound good"
"Positive","Just needed the fitting: I only bought this because I couldn't find the fitting to adapt a replacement hose to my gun. As it turns out, it is a better option getting the unit altogether. The hose is lighter than the replacement hose I would have adapted to which would have made the use more cumbersome with the heavier hose. I hope this lasts as long as the original (6 years of regular use)."
"Negative","Anti Anti Anti! When did Christ teach these principles?: Most importantly this book is inaccurate. It offers little more than can be found on any anti Mormon site for free! Save your money. I would like to add that it is so disappointing that people spend there time bashing other religions of any denomination. What is guarnateed is that we will all be judged. As much belief as we have in Christ he said 'if ye love me keep my commandments'. There seems to be enough clarity expressed in this statement to justify that we must all try to obey them if we are to profess our love of him who atoned for our sins. Can one imagine meeting him and expressing that ' Oh yes, I broke all of your commandments regularly, but your grace is sufficient for me to allow complete indifference to you. I know I added to the beads of blood from every pore but what does that matter - you can give me your grace'! Good luck to all of those so called followers of Christ who believe the doctrines of men."
"Negative","Good premise, bad delivery: This was a great idea for a book. However, I thought it would be about WWII and spies, but for the most part it was about homosexuality and promiscuity. It seemed that Mr. Follet cared more about sexual details than he did about telling a story about the SOE behind enemy lines in France. I also thought that Homosexuals were still a minority in todays world, let alone 1945. But 3 out of the 6 women in Mr. Follets book were gay. Great premise Mr. Follet, bad delivery. This is one reader who will not be coming back."
"Negative","needs more work at the lab: The concept was a good idea, but the execution a bit flawed. It was difficult to get the joystick to move to the exact location. It also didn't register the place that you wanted to find out about when you clicked on it."
"Positive","Great cookbook for reading and cooking!: This book is on my wish list. I borrowed it from the library and I love the recipes and other information found in this book. Whether you are Portuguese or not, the recipes are mostly comfort food and are very easy to make except maybe the bread and dessert recipes. They aren't difficult either for people who do bake. One word of caution, there are lots of salt cod recipes in this book and some people may not appreciate that as much as I do. That was the selling point for me. There are also many recipes that use linguica and other Portuguese sausages and that's a bit of a problem for me because I can't buy that where I live. However, I am looking into either making my own or ordering online."
"Negative","What a Waste of Money: I took this for a full month as per instructions. No change, nothing at all. Don't waste your money. I'd give this zero stars if it was possible."
"Negative","Not cordless, picture is deceiving: I bought this keyboard thinking it was cordless because it looks that way in the picture. I was very disapointed when it came, cord attached. I guess I should read the descrption of things I buy in the future a little more carefully. Needless to say, I am sending this back!"
"Negative","A little slippery.: Beautiful sleak design but not functional. The smooth surface does not allow for sufficient grip of food item."
"Positive","Tastiest Decaf Tea: Constant Comment by Bigelow is our favorite tea, and is no longer available in local markets in the decaffeinated version. We were thankful when we found it available on line, as we need to avoid caffein for medical reasons.Bigelow Decaffeinated Constant Comment Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)"
"Positive","Nanook, the cutest Husky around: This is the cutest pup around. He is very durable and made of a real soft fabric. He has blue eyes with black pupils. He would be a nice companion for any one of any age."
"Negative","Huge Disappointment: ""Blurring the Edges"" is a really good CD that belongs right alongside efforts by Fiona Apple and Alanis Morissette. This CD might as well be by Michelle Branch. It is very well put together and completely uninteresting."
"Negative","Stopped working properly a few months in.: It will connect some of my USB devices but not others. Seems like the power adapter is broken. The power on indicator light just flickers on and off very softly."
"Negative","WHY DO I GIVE THIS ONE STAR?: Because Zero Stars is not an option. This film is garbage in the Criterion Collection. I cannot understand why Criterion would put Michael Bay's run-of-the-mill hollywood brainless summer blockbuster movies (Yes they even took on ""The Rock"") on the same page as Fellini, Renoir, Goddard, Hitchcock, Bergman, etc. This is an insult to film as art (which I thought Criterion was dedicated to). And I'm not pretentious, I'm just stating the obvious. Why does Criterion pick up this movie and not other recent movies much more worthy of the Criterion label--Paul Thomas Anderson's movies for example (esp. Magnolia)? Or even Darren Aronofsy's work (esp. Pi)? The list goes on... this is ridiculous!"
"Negative","Didn't work.: I got the case, which seemed fine. I opened the case to find a very strange looking DVD. The front was labeled (500) Days of Summer, and I don't doubt that it was the right disk, but...The back of the disk was completely warped. It was bumpy and strange looking, almost twisted, yet the disk wasn't out of shape. Needless to say, it didn't work."
"Negative","Probably for more advanced Spanish students.: This is a great resource but I want to copy the casettes to a DVD and my iPod but haven't figured how to do it with my rack system yet. This selection is in my opinion for more advanced Spanish students than me.Also the book was heavily marked in ballpoint pen but still acceptable. It will come in very handy after I learn more Spanish Basics."
"Negative","Does NOT fit DA3000R: The product description is inaccurate. This key does NOT fit the DA3000R, and may not fit others listed."
"Positive","A Lorrie Moore book is a treasure: Lorrie Moore has an unmatched ability to mix verbal jokes and funny moments with tragic ones. She makes it look easy, but the craftmanship inherent in her work is quite complicated. She makes her readers feel her characters with their hearts and their minds. You'll laugh out loud and you feel lingering sadness.My favorite story in the collection is ""Places to Look for your Mind."" I couldn't stop thinking about it, the characters were so real to me.This whole book is a pleasure."
"Positive","A soulful child: Black Boy is one of those books that every race, ethnic group, culture, religon, and belief should read especially black people. Black Boy is a book that helps open the minds of other races about how black people had to live in those days, and for black people it is a good book that helps us to remember where we came from, and how far it brought us from those days. Black Boy is a book that helps alot of people well it helped me to get a better understanding on my Black heritage and how my family and other Black families reached the point where we can look back and not be mad at what happeded to black people in those days."
"Positive","An account of the mountaineering history of Mt. Rainier.: This book is a wonderful read! The author's love for mountains and mountaineering comes out clearly in his prose and illustrations. If you share in his love of Mt. Rainier you will love this book!"
"Negative","predictable, but still: an okay movie for Christmas-crazy viewers. Reese Witherspoon is always so lovely, and even though you know where the movie will end up, it's kinda fun to watch! For renting, not for buying."
"Negative","What about us?: I agree with all the comments above especailly the person who wrote about the uk fans not being able to have their own charmed dvd box set because of the format.Ever since buffy and angel were stupidly cancelled I've looking for an alternative untill I found 'Charmed' and loved every second of the episode. Although I havent followed the cult television programme from the start I would love to have the dvd box set of season 1 just to get all the needed gossip on demons and witches. But once again us english fans are bottom of the list, and need to wait untill someone suddenly realises that we are being left out."
"Positive","Good Gate, but some minor faults: This gate is exactly what it says, a wider than average gate. Works as expected. I only with the retaining clips on the top and bottom are very weak. But, for the price it is exactly what you expect."
"Negative","third time's a charm: They should have stopped at III.I found one song on IV that I liked.I wish I could get my money back."
"Positive","this is out soon!: this movie looks so cool and i think it has that song tik tok but i am not sure, but i do not like the lyrics, i just like the beat. but any way back to the movie i love the cover of the marmauke case!!!!! like i said the movie is so cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Negative","Duck Soup it ain't: Quirky, yes. Funny, not so much. But for people who think sophomoric equals clever, this is the perfect DVD."
"Positive","Perfect for travel or street evangelism: This is an attractive, durable, compact Bible with the reliable, easy to read NASB translation and Christ's Words in red. The cover is finished very nicely and is very flexible.Unfortunately, though God's Word is perfect, this Bible has it's flaw. Namely, no cross references. What's up with that? There is sufficient space in the margins for you to write in references with a fine-point pen.If you need a compact Bible for travel or for carrying as you share your faith (you do go out and share your faith, right?) this is a very nice Bible."
"Positive","tough bit great price: Easy to use ...... the bits hold an edge for a very very long time....... locally these bits are 3 times this price......I strongly endorse this product .......made in the USA"
"Negative","Don't bother: I was looking for a paper cutter for small projects that I occasionally run into as a designer (prototyping, photo trimming, etc). I bought this item because of the other reviews on this page. I first noticed an issue when trimming photo paper - the trimmer wouldn't cut all the way through the photo paper I was cutting. I was using the guides on the trimmer to find my cuts. The guides were good. The second issue was noted when I was trimming to a mark (not using the guides). There is no way to line up the trim line (know where the blade will strike)."
"Negative","Junk: Wow! I guess I should feel lucky. My MVR650 didn't start eating tapes until months after I bought it. Well, not eating them outright, anyway. It *always* chewed on them a bit. From the beginning fast forwarding would scrape the oxide off the tape (that section would never be watchable again) but it didn't actually start refusing to release the tape for several months. Shutting itself off as soon as you inserted a tape didn't start for months either along with ejecting that cassette once you turned it back on. Oh, but I said it wouldn't release the tape, didn't I? Well it would eject the *cassette*, but that doesn't mean it would release the *tape*.I lived with this piece of junk so long because it is hard to find a VCR these days narrow enough to fit on my shelf. Everyone seems to have gone to those 17 inch behemoths."
"Negative","Not for me: I read a lot of the reviews here before buying this. So, I knew there could be problems if you live in a larger area with a lot of stations. But, this thing worked terrible for me, when I first tried it yesterday. The few stations I found that would work, would work intermittently. It would sound fine, then as it went out of stereo, for whatever reason, it wouldn't.Also, read and knew about changing it to international mode, as described here. That was an exercise in frustration. Perhaps I'm missing something? When I hold down Preset, and it goes from 1, to XL, then to US, nothing happens when I hit + or -.I'm sending this thing back, and getting a cassette adapter for my MP3 player.Wish I'd known more at the time, as both my cars have cassette players"
"Positive","Misery Loves Company: This book is very good because it shows misery in a good way. I have read all of the books in the series and this is one of my favorites. Klaus, Violet, and Sunny go to a school called ""The Austere Academy,"" but since they are orphans, they have to stay in the ""Orphan Shack,"" instead of a nice apartment. One of the good parts is when Violet invents shoes with metal bottoms to scare away the crabs that constantly come into their shack. I am a 9 year old boy and I can't get enough of these books!"
"Negative","Worked great for about 6 months: I loved this thing when I got it and used it every day during my train commute to and from work. It worked fantastic ... the sound was awesome and it was more than loud enough with the sony headphones I bought for it. I recommend buying aftermarket headphones since the headphones that come with it are big and [crazy] looking and don't sound too great. Then all of a sudden one day the headphone jack (where you plug the headphones in) just stopped working. For a while if I twisted the little plug the right way it would work, but then it just stopped working alltogether. I tried three other pairs of headphones including the ones it came with, and none of them worked. Hopefully mine was an isolated case, but I don't think I would ever buy this again."
"Negative","Reviews are right: I bought 2 despite the reviews thinking that may be there was a bad batch It looks not well made and true instructions and tape are lousy The other one for my son was never used but mine AFTER a month started going off at 4 am and 10 am etc waking us up Turned lite of but did not help I just went through Amazan return NEVER had a bad experience and I learn that SIXTY days have passed so I will NOT get complete REFUND What a shame & they still sell this junk!!BUYER BEWARE!!"
"Negative","Good for about six months: This remote is nice when it's new but breaks easily. I am on my third remote. The screen broke on the first one and, although it still worked, I could not see any of the information. The second one transmits but does not receive. I take pretty good care of the remotes so they should not break so easily. They should make a more rugged version. Luckily my business pays for the replacements or I might be a little more upset."
"Negative","Poor Sound Quality: If you are looking for a good John Denver album this is not it, unless you like AM radio sound quality. The songs on this album are great, but I recommned picking a different John Denver album."
"Negative","Viewing for Specialists...: Maybe, simplistic English subtitles following a repeatedly-boring stills of story presenting a special services officer job-spaying over co-citizens, make a viewer even more asleep than just watching average images of characters hungry for copulating.Well, what all this fuss about Oscar et al? A Stasi employer is shown as a citizen bored to tamper with dirty clothes of others?At the end of the day, no call-girl services were available in Honneker Germany."
"Positive","avatar dvd: This movie has excellent visual effects. This is a movie worth seeing. We watched the blu-ray dvd and the effects were alot better. Would recommend this but this is a movie that you have to pay close attention to follow it."
"Positive","It is what it says it is: So if this is what you want it is the real thing. but why do we have to be so wordy"
"Positive","A great reference but BEWARE!: This book may become one of my most often consulted reference books. However, Dettmer is quick to point out that it does not contain the needed TOC thinking processes and therefore presumes a good bit of expertise. The reader should have a background in TOC or regard Dettmer's earlier work, Godlratt's Theory of Constraint's--A Systems Approach to TOC, as prerequisite. The author claims that chapter 5--Defining the Paradigm is perhaps the most important. I tend to agree but perhaps for a differnt reason: it provides a great precursor to Goldratt's Strategy and Tactics tree."
"Negative","Not worth it's money: very bad metal quality. Easy oxidize with white patina after every wash. First few grounded peaces always have black color.Not worth buying."
"Negative","They Ruined the Greatest Live Album of All Time.: The original 'Sam Cooke Live at the Harlem Square Club' was the greatest live album of all time. Listening to it you feel jealous of everyone who was there. Never has a singer and and his band his audience been so in sync with each other. The crowd singalong with 'I love you for sentimental reasons' is as magical a recording as exists. The call and answer 'let me hear you say yeah!' on 'Bring it on home' is as exciting as music gets. No wonder the women in the audience are screaming to what sounds like the point of orgasm.But this new mastered version takes all the audience vibes out. And it kills the amazingly hot sax counterpoints of King Curtis. Now it's just another CD. Man if aint broke don't fix it. But they did and they ruined it."
"Negative","Sorry I Read It: I set out to read this book as a fan of Hillary, and a woman and attorney who believed Hillary could and would someday be President. By the time I finished the book, I was sorry I read it because I lost a role model. Anyone reading between the lines will be turned off by her excuses, conspiracy theories, and frankly, lies. To vent my frustrations, I bought Dick Morris's response to Hillary's book (appropriately titled ""Rewriting History"") and he pretty much laid it out just as I saw it. Morris stated what was was obvious from reading Hillary's book, but it was good therapy. Morris was also more objective than I expected after the first couple of chapters of his book. Ironically, I saw more Hillary attributes by Morris's criticism of Hillary than I gathered from Hillary's book."
"Positive","Blazing Angels 2:Secret Missions of WWII: This was a gift for my 13yr.old grandson;he flys for hours at a time.The graphics and mission choices are great.As he wants to join the Air Force we will be ordering more flying games and flight simulations.He loves the old planes!"
"Positive","The most important book ever written for artist's and creators: This book has changed my life, I understand myself and the world around me more because of this book. I just finished the book and I feel it's important to get the word out to other artist's, you are not alone, this book will help. After reading a lot of art self help books I feel I will never have to read another. This book is the ultimate guide to understanding the creative mind, this book has become my study guide for life. I promise you will never let this one go ever! Very proud owner, Rich Brown, Tampa, Florida"
"Positive","Great version of Layer Cake: This is a A+ version of Layer Cake. The picture is stunning. If you want to own this movie definitely by this over a DVD."
"Positive","A great boat.: A super good boat. I think it is a lot better then my friend's boat.he has a tyco and it goes like two miles a hour!so far i havent had any trouble . over all i think it is a very good boat."
"Negative","boggles the mindless .......: So, these machines have been buried for just how long? and the aliens travel via light? Yet, they senselessly vaporise, and ignite [?] in some cases the homo sapiens creatures, when they really need bodylfuids, as vaguely demonstrated later .....We never get to drive in a tripod's cockpit, and the aliens? They look vaguely like the ancient Kennedy ladies at bergdorffs, rummaging through bargain basement.The earlier version was by far more satisfying.Considering the immense budget - this one falls short and is rather flaccid and impotent.Viewing for the numb-less, or is that numbed?"
"Negative","the machine is defective: the machine is defective, as it gets hot the top coffee container pops open and the coffee spills all over the counter.I will never purchase another product like this on line"
"Negative","Don't waste your $$$: Don't waste your $$$ on this one. I just received 2 of these things and I am very disappointed. It might say 'Plantronics' in the ad but there aren't any marking of the manufacturer. They were in a small zip log bag when I received them. The quality on how they are made is very poor to say the least. You get what you pay for. On the other hand, they do work. but for how long??"
"Negative","Really just for absolute beginners.. not inspiring.: I know im intermediate belly dancer but wanted something at home to keep me inspired for practicing.I bought this DVD, one from AZIZA and one from Saidi.This one was the most uninspiring. maybe good for someone who has never done ANY bellydancing before.. but even so Saidi instruction was clearer, movements more beautiful, shown in all angles.. perfect."
"Positive","The cay: The CayI thought at the start of the book this was going to be good. Theodore Taylor was going down the right track with the exciting background,Philip Getting separated from his parents on his way back to Virginia from the town of Willemstad, a town in South America their ship is torpedoed by German U-boats coming because of World War II Philip gets hit on the head and awakens to find that he is on a raft separated from his parents with no one except a cat named Stew-Cat and a West Indian and racially explained ""negro"" (sorry for any racial names)and to top it all off he goes blind! Being stranded on a cay in the middle of nowhere with nothing but a keg of water and stale crackers Philip thinks he is doomed!This book has an exciting start and a heartwarming end, it will keep you wanting to read it over and over again!Preston Amato of elgin"
"Positive","IMHO The best Role Playing Game Ever: If you have ever dreamt of becoming one of Roger Zelazny's AmberPrince, then buy this call some of your friends and have fun.This is, I think, the first Diceless RP-System and I can tell youthat it really works...By the way, if you want to get opinions from people using theGame : subscribe to the Amber mailing list: a high bandwithmailing list dedicated to the Amber Diceless Role-Playing andRoger Zelazny's Amber (send an e-mail message to Majordomo@logrus.orgwith in the message body: subscribe amber <your e-mail @>)It's way too bad Roger Zelazny died on 14 June 1995... :-("
"Negative","The weakest of the three Whiskeytown albums.: Not nearly as good as their earlier two albums. If you've devoured Stranger's Almanac and Faithless Street and still want more, I suggest skipping ahead to Ryan Adams' Heartbreaker."
"Negative","Computer Programming in Visual Basic 6.0: This text is fairly easy to read and does a good job at organization and using applicable examples but has far too many errors, mistakes, typos and inconsistencies. In some chapters, I have found errors on almost every page. Some mistakes were so critical that they made it difficult to understand the relevant concept. Someone should have done a better job of reviewing this printing before it went to press. Maybe after the 2nd or 3rd printing is will be a good short coarse textbook, but frustration will probably result for many students if corrections are not made. Also, some syntax was used without any explanation (i.e. colons were used on page 135 in lines of code and not explained what they do until the next chapter). Hopefully the second half will be better as I am only half way through the book so far."
"Positive","Enlightening and intriguing, highly recommended: What is it that distinguishes humans from the rest of animal kingdom? Why can only humans communicate through auditory and written symbols that can be recombined into virtually infinite meanings, hypothesize what the future may bring, or imagine the unknown? The Human Spark with Alan Alda explores the differences between modern homo sapiens, our extinct Neanderthal cousins, and modern-day chimpanzees. An extraordinary documentary about what modern-day science has to say about the quintessential distinguishing features of humanity, The Human Spark with Alan Alda is enlightening and intriguing, highly recommended especially for public library collections. 3 hours, widescreen, closed captioned."
"Positive","A Little Disappointed: I loved the movie ""Basquiat"" and one of the things I loved most about it was the music. I wouldn't sell my copy of the soundtrack but I have to admit, I was a little disappointed to find that quite a few of the songs in the movie do not appear on the soundtrack. What further confused me was the fact that some of the songs less prominently featured in the movie were included on the cd, making the absence of the others that much more glaring. Makes you wonder what the producers of the cd were thinking by not including so much as a single track from the film's original score. I was excited to find the ""Suicide Hotline"" track on the cd, but was quickly disappointed by the fact it only runs 2:08. Still, I recommend the cd for hard-core ""Basquiat"" fans. Just a heads-up to all those potential purchasers who may find themselves a little disappointed by the overall product."
"Negative","Redundant, repetitive, and?: I was disappointed by this effort. Friedman is obviously intelligent and well-informed, but this book came across as a series of clunky anecdotes, arguing from a premise which did not seem totally supported by much in the way of fact. I suppose this is more typical of the journalistic style one would expect, but there did not seem to be much of substance here, or any real historical context that would give this persuasive weight. Lots of snippets by various characters, suggesting some interesting ideas, but hardly conclusive.I got tired of the constant references to the ""flat world""; finally I had to give up.Others may well find (and have obviously found) this to be a persuasive and engaging book."
"Negative","If you liked Open you'll probably like this one: I'm an avid Cowboy Junkies fan, but their last two albums, Open and now One Soul Now, just haven't done it for me. The band is definitely moving in a new direction, I just personally don't like it. There are a few good tracks on the CD, but, I find myself hitting the fast forward button too often."
"Negative","This thing sucks: We bought this based on other reviews.... it is a waste of money. It teaches you a bunch of crap you don't need to know. Not that some of the things wouldn't be useful later if you want to be truely fluent in Irish, but in the first CD, why are you teaching someone how to say ""God Bless the Work""???? Like that's going to come up in conversation? These cd's really suck. I don't know why they put so much ""useless"" information/sentences/words in there, and stayed away from basic speech so much. This thing is just a mess. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone! It is a total waste of money! BLAH!"
"Positive","CLEAR and PRECISE: I think it is the clarity and precision with which the author presents her ideas. Very good resource material for my daughter. She uses it!"
"Positive","An entertaining thriller: I liked the book very much. It is a clever story line that is both entertaining and unpredictable. As usual, Pearson is extremely descriptive and insightful in forensic science. If you like thrillers about serial killers, this book is for you!"
"Negative","Horrible: BE WARE. This product was designed specifically for use with TINY mp3 players like the ipod shuffle (which is, in my opinion, another ridiculous product) and is not much use for anything else. The cord is hardly a foot long. I had to return it immediately."
"Negative","Too small, not the European style smoker box: My bad for not checking out the size; this is way too small for my needs. I was expecting the European style smoker box that is large enough to put a large fish or salon steaks on a grill inside the box along with the chips on the bottom, place the lid on and put on top of the BBQ or on top of stove [be sure to have a strong smoke extractor]. The heat from the BBQ sets the chips smoldering and smokes the fish/meat/fowl/fruit/etc.Should have guessed it was not what I was looking for by the price. I did not see a discription or size listed on the product listing."
"Negative","What a rip off!: This book is hopelessly OUTDATED! It claims to have been ""Revised"" in 1999. You could save a lot more time and the cost of this lousy book by doing the research on your computer."
"Positive","Great sheets for kids...: We bought a couple of these for our two daughters a couple of months ago. Several washes later they are perfect! Same nice colors...same beautiful look.Our daughters are happy with their sheets, their beds look great and they say the sheets are soft and cozy. These ones look really pretty on a white bed!The combination of light green and soft pink is very pretty. 200 thread count seems low, but this sheets are soft!! They feel more like a 350 thread count ones.Couldn't be happier with this product. Totally recommend it."
"Negative","Hype: The worst singer in the history of recorded sound. He must have been a charming fellow, because he couldn't sing worth a darn."
"Positive","Fabulous,,: I purchased this DVD for my mother. Since brain surgery she has not been confident doing exercises with lots of bending as she looses her balance. The exercises on this dvd gives her a full body workout while sitting so she is very comfortable doing them . Honestly I enjoy doing them with her and I am 50 years old. ."
"Positive","the best barbie in the world: I got this for my 9th birthday and I absolutely love it. The shoes are wonderful. I did have a little trouble putting the cake together and getting the present together again but it is so much fun i could play with it all day. It is very educational. I recommend it. It is a beautiful doll. Please buy it for your kids birthday. It is every girls dream to have a barbie doll with the same birthday as you, i think."
"Positive","We love this movie!: Ever since my children were young we have watched the Wee Sing movies. It's a Christmas tradition in our family!"
"Positive","Video Review: Length:: 6:20 MinsThis is my video Review of Stargate Continuum. For more video reviews, search ""MikePetel"" on Youtube. Enjoy!"
"Positive","The only readable book on telecommunication signaling: Van Bosse is to be commended for creating the first and to date only readable text on telecommunication signaling. If you're looking for an explanation of how various signaling protocols are used in the PSTN, this book provides all the essential information you need."
"Positive","The Best Outfield In Along Time: I have been a huge fan since I heard ""Play Deep"" and this one believe it or not comes close to that awesome album. Songs on here you can listen to over and over and not get bored. Its a mixed bag of all that the Outfield has to offer to music fans everywhere. It leaves you wanting to play it again and again. I had bought ""It Aint Over"" off there website which contains alot of the music that made it on to ""extra innings"" and I must say im very impressed with the songs they added such as Heavens Little Angel, One Love, and one of my new favorite songs has to be They Can't Knock You Down Again. This song really rocks like no other since ""Bangin"". In general I just want to say if your on this page looking to buy the old Outfield albums such as Play Deep I would urge you to buy this cd guaranteed you will not be dissapointed. There definitely backDan G. (From the City By The Bay)"
"Negative","Promising premise but........: The summary on the back is very catchy - and I as very excited about reading this book. Unfortunately, the story misses the gripping element. I had such high expectations - and maybe that's why it felt like such a flop."
"Positive","Excellent DVD for fit mom's the want to workout.: I am physically fit and in great shape. I purchased this DVD to stay in shape during my pregnancy. I think it is an excellent DVD and would recommend it to any fit mom's-to-be. If you are not used to working out or are not in shape already, it might be a bit challenging for you.She does use a chair and wall for some of the moves, but you don't need any weights or other workout equipment. It's divided into two parts, the first is 40 minutes and the second you do with your partner. That one is only 20 minutes. I haven't done the second workout yet."
"Negative","Didn't enjoy it at all.: I found this book to be a bit smug and too cute for it's own good. The author tries to place importance on the most trivial things and in the end, the reader is left bored."
"Positive","my husband & I loved it!: My hubby & I loved it, already watched it twice now. One of these days I will have my grandaughter over and put it on for her, lol.Great cast of characters and quite funny. Amazing how they actually made it (in the extras part). This is for sure a keeper."
"Positive","The BFG: The BFG, is a book about a big friendly giant who captures a little girl named Sophie with his enormous ears.Instead of gobbling children he blows dreams. He takes her to giant country to keep her for the rest of her life.The theam of this book is that not every bodys nice and not every bodys mean.I really enjoyed reading the B F G. It was the best book so far in my life. I recommend this to the whole world!"
"Negative","unhappy user: WE are avid coffee drinkers brewing probably too many pots a day. I would not buy or recommend this pot again and here are my reasons why. 1.) The red level ball rarely pops up, you need to tap the pot, 2.) The pot is extremely noisy when brewing, 3.) The water well is hard to fill, we ended up buying a pitcher to use, 4.) the lid is a pain always having to adjust for pouring or keeping warm, 5.) The coffee pours too slow, 6.) the filters are expensive and for the amt we brew we would be chaning filters once a week.We loved our Braun not sure why they quit making coffee pots.thanks"
"Negative","Not for Kids: This book is not for kids. It contains several disparaging comments about husbands, marrige and religion, and it uses words like ""whitey."" It is really rather mean and nasty humor. Too bad, really. I was hoping for some well researched inspiring stories of American women to share with my daughter. This book is not appropriate for that."
"Negative","Hoping for Better: Another okay novel in the Sword of Truth series. I keep thinking that I will fall for these and eagerly anticipate the next one but I'm still only mildly attached. I have a few more in the series on my shelf already so I'll keep going with higher hopes for the next one."
"Negative","I Would Love This If I Could Afford to See It.: I love City Hunter. But the people selling City Hunter 3 and '91 must have learned selling techniques from drug dealers. I was able to buy the first two seasons of City Hunter, which are like - 52 episodes each, mind you - for between 20 and 30 bucks. Now they want over two hundred dollars for a season that's not even half the usual amount of episodes? And I mean I love that show, but that's ridiculous."
"Negative","Inconsistent quality: The first PMDVR8 I owned worked extremely well for about 2 years. After it began to fail, I purchased 2 more. One of the two never worked consistently and failed completely in about a month. The other failed in about 4 months of light use. Even inexpensive remotes should last longer."
"Positive","Good read: Well I have to say I liked this book really well until the very end. It was a little confusing in the end and I did have to go back and reread it. It was a good book though and I am glad I read it. Not as good as Alice's Tulips but still worth the time."
"Negative","Over Written: I am currently trying, and I mean really trying to read The Risk Pool by Russo but am very bogged down at about one third of the way through the book and I just wish the protagonist would get on with it and grow up - i.e. not in the sense that he is immature but that I wish he wouldgraduate so we can see what happens to him if and when he reaches adulthood - given how over written this book is - I sometimes thinkwe never will. I usually very much like Richard Russo's prose but this novel is an exemption and I mean that in a bad way. On the other hand I just loved Straight Man, A Novel which I also purchased for my Kindle on Amazon.com."
"Negative","Terrible First Episode, Very Good Series: The first episode is stunningly bad, which makes it surprising how the subsequent episodes are uniformly excellent.Episode 2 - ""Roadblock Duty"" - ExcellentDepicts how terrorists are using civilians as human shields, and also hiding terrorists and bombs in vehicle trunks.Episode 3 - ""The Prisoner"" - ExcellentAggressive interrogation techniques, to the early dismay of a wimpy soldier, yield important intelligence that saves US lives.Episode 4 - Didn't see this oneEpisode 5 - ""Embedded"" - ExcellentThis episode dealt with 'jihadists' setting up US troops in a small town, by intentionally using a little boy as bait (making him run at the troops). The 'jihadists' had also pre-positioned cameras, to film the child they had killed, which the willing ""mainstream"" media accomplices replayed over and over, providing a propaganda coup for the terrorists."
"Negative","Don't we have more respect for kids than this?: This is the worst acting in a children's movie that I have EVER seen. Nothing matter with the basic idea of the fanciful plot, but everything about the movie, from special effects to horrible acting, makes it the worst of filmmaking EVER. Skip it."
"Negative","Unreliable: After only a few months use part of the display has stopped working, so I can see only one-half of the hour digit and one-half of the minutes digit - leaving me often guessing as to the exact time"
"Positive","charming book for all ages: I originally bought this book for my granddaughter but was so taken with the charm and love expressed in the paintings that I also got it for myself as well as for other nieces.....this belongs on your keep it forever shelf."
"Positive","Fantastic sound for the price, but ergonomics are lacking.: The iGrado headphones have got to be the best quality sound you can possibly get for the price. I've gone through and listened to most of my music library again just to see how differently they sound through my new headphones. They facilitate incredible clarity and depth I had only previously experienced through studio quality phones. I can turn them up very loud without hurting my ears and without completely blocking out the outside world (which is usually a good thing). The only complaint I have is the plastic its made out of is very stiff, and it squeezes my head a bit too much (As I have a pretty big head) and my ears get a little sore after a while.If you are looking for very high quality headphones for casual use on the cheap, there isn't a better deal out there. But wide-headed people beware! Your ears will begin to complain midway through your average album."
"Negative","OOps I wrote on wrong one: This is the season we have been waiting for for ever. We have to wait until the next season starts and I think that is bogus. It is not in the consumers best interest...get it together you would sell more if they were available sooner."
"Positive","Could not locate these bulbs at local hardware stores.: Have been satisfied with the original MAGLITE flashlights (especially the extra bulb located in the base cap). Found out (trial & error) that not all flashlight bulbs (despite appearance and fit) will work in these high end utility lamps. Letting someone borrow these excellant lites became a chore to have them returned.Haven't purchased the newer version MAGLITE & don't anticipate having to because of quality failure."
"Negative","Ugggh Nicolas another bomb?: Cage -- you either love his movies OR hate them. I hated this. Typical comic book turned into movie. Read the comic and save your money on this one."
"Positive","Finally, more Richard Harris on CD: These albums have always been two of my favorites. I am so happy to see them on CD. I love Richard Harris' voice and the song are wonderful. Now, if we can just get ""I, In the Membership of My Days"" the collection will be complete.Great Music!!!"
"Negative","A Prince DVD WITHOUT 'Purple Rain'?!!!--Unacceptable!: The DVD was okay, but I never would have bought this had I realized that it was missing the video for 'Purple Rain'--possibly Prince's greatest hit of all time!"
"Negative","I am done...: Have been a justified fan since the beginning but I noticed this season the writers going too far. This last episode, ""Guy Walks Into a Bar"" just pushed the line beyond what I want to watch. No thanks to naked child molesters. I enjoyed Rayland's character but enough is enough...cancelled my amazon pre purchase of the whole season."
"Positive","John Taylor Feelings Are Good!: This is fantastic. John shows more of the punk, hard edge side of his music. This is a big departure from Duran Duran....and is sometimes very raw....but all John Taylor. Very cool!"
"Negative","Don't Waste your money!: I was a fan of the first Kingdom Hearts Guide, but this on is completely lacking! it does not offer information to help you along in the game, it merely tells you what you already know!waste. of. money."
"Positive","Nice little grow light!: I got this in a timely manner and everything is in good condition. the light bulb is pretty thin only it seems to be fine to me! I am overall pleased with the purchase. The light fixture is pretty light weight and seems to be made of cheap materials which is why I am only giving only 4 stars. I would recommend the item to others based on the price. It was a lot cheaper than anything I could find else where."
"Positive","This is awesome!: I have tried multiple products over the years for cleaning up pet messes. This is by the far the best stuff I have every used!"
"Negative","Deeply disappointing: Not up to Adair's usual standard. I don't mind if a book in this genre has an unlikely plot, but it annoys me when it is full of holes. The heroine is pathetic and not very smart. The writing is not witty or suspenseful and I ended up flipping through the pages."
"Positive","Gorgeous tribute to a Kansas teacher and artist...: He would have wanted to be remembered most as a teacher and friend; he was that and more to those that were fortunate enough to have known him. Such was the life of the great Swedish artist Birger Sandzen.In a glowing tribute to the man and his work, Emory Lindquist has managed to capture the essence of who he was and what he has meant to Kansas art. An absolutely beautiful account of his art and influence. Sandzen was a one of a kind visionary of the beauty that surrounds us in everyday life and nature. A first rate work by a learned historian, and obvious devotee, of Sandzen."
"Positive","Great buy - great service: Usually stuff from the States takes forever to get here, this time it went fine. Great CD. Seller = great service and lots of good products."
"Negative","very light in content: The book is very light in content and written with a very narrow approach. If you want to learn anything about real estate don't buy this book."
"Negative","Wrong battery: Although the description was correct, the battery was not the right one for my IBM 600X. The polarity is reversed at the connector, compared to the original battery."
"Negative","VTech is a no-go: As another reviewer said, the volume is insufficient, even when turned up to maximum. With the slightest background noise, you will not hear the other party. Would try a Toshiba, but reviewers have had battery problems."
"Positive","Different from any other horror film currently out there.: In the same vein as SAW and SAW2. Disturbing ,violent stuff! Paxton (Jay Hernandez) is a total hottie!! Can't wait to see more of him."
"Positive","Perfect!!!: This is the fourth film in the series and begins with an attack on the Castle of Frankenstein, which is is usually seen at the end. Upon it's release from it's tomb, the Monster(Chaney)is taken by Ygor(Lugosi)to the second son of Frankenstein, Ludwig. There, the Monster's criminal brain is removed and just wait and see whose brain is put in! Exciting from the start, The Ghost of Frankenstein is a real classic to enjoy!"
"Negative","Waste of money and effort: Nothing but trouble with horrible picture quality when it does manage to function correctly. Don't waste your time or money on this product."
"Positive","Amazing: If you are in high school, or if you're trying to rekindle your high school days, this is the book to bring all of those memories flooding back."
"Positive","A good sequel to ""Star Trek IV"": Well written story, but drags at times with unnecessary banter and talk. I've read a few of Margaret's stories, but have trouble getting through them due to the extensive content she puts in them.I remember in 1991 when this book was first supposed to hit the book stores. It took forever and that's when I later heard about the problems Margaret was having in her original story. Also, the rumor was that this story was going to contradict the events in ""Star Trek VI"" so it had to be postponed. I don't see why Paramount can't just get together with the authors first and come to a conclusion or agreement.I loved the comment one reader made. I also think they should release an original story version of what it was really going to be about."
"Negative","Excellently Written Book About Nothing at All: The Sportswriter is neither about sports nor writing. It is about one excruciatingly boring week in the mundane life of a mundane divorced man. There is no real story. There is no beginning, no end, and no real climax. We just follow the life of the guy as he moves through his life for a week.The journey is genuine, and Richard Ford very accurately relates the dialog, feelings and experiences that such a man would have during such a week. The problem is that his life is just really, really boring.The main character, Frank Bascombe, is reflective and introspective during this week and while his thoughts seem genuine, they are neither inciteful or interesting.I enjoyed the writing style and it was done so well it might have been a real life journal. Just a very boring one.I can only recommend this book to voracious readers who don't mind spending hours reading without expecting much entertainment value."
"Negative","Contrived: This CD is NOT country music. It is slick, contrived, manufactured, pop marketed to those people who THINK they like country music but don't. That it has been so hugely successful is one of the saddest commentaries on our culture here at the end of the 20th century."
"Positive","Pure Consciousness!: If you are looking for the standard Blue Note Horace Silver (acoustic, quintet/sextet, w little or no vocals) this is not one the to get for that. This is music for those on the path to higher heights. If you want to jam to some truly inspirational music, this is a gem waiting for you to discover it. If you can grasp the wisdom of the law of cause and effect, eating healthy & working out, and just living life at a higher frequency, I promise you that you will be thankful that this CD became manifest in your world. Like probably anyone reading this review, I have a very large music library. If I were to have to start my collection all over, this would be one of the first CDs I would purchase. ""All is in mind!"""
"Negative","Disgusted: I was disgusted by the grotesque display of savagery in this novel. I found it lacking purpose and realism. All I found in this novel is one man's sick views of humanity. I do not reccomend this novel to anyone, especially children."
"Positive","Sensational book: When I read Chasing the Dime, it became one of my favorites. I am an avid reader of Michael's books, and to me, this is one of his best ever. I never expected the negative criticism that I see with this book.As a writer myself, I understand that everyone isn't going to like every book, but the amount of low reviews really shock me.John Foxjohnwww.johnfoxjohnhome.com"
"Positive","Shirley: Not just for kids. Excellent for someone in a wheelchair. Love this item! I do not have children in the house, so if you want it for a kid's room consider that the base, while sturdy is not weighted, so must keep pegs on each side balanced when hanging heavier items like coats, so it won't tip."
"Positive","bump under toe hurts at first: These look comfy and in a way they are. Good arch support. My problem was th e bump under the toes, the right foot hurt me for a week or so and still bothers me a bit. I live in NYC and walking in flips flops/sandals is wearing on your ankles and feet. Not to mention getting home and seeing how DIRTY your heals are. EEEK! The birkis eliminate that which i love."
"Positive","Does just enough...: I wanted a monitor that would tell me how many calories I was burning during my Zumba class. I also wear it on the treadmill or at the gym to get a more accurate calorie count than what the machines say (my monitor shows I burn more.) The price is right and it's easy to use."
"Positive","hp printer ink: The cartridges were the typical excellent quality products from HP. I was very pleased with them. I've tried using substitute cartridges. They never seem to work or last as long as good HP products."
"Positive","A Musiical Treasure: Versatile and impressive are just two adjectives that appropriately describe the music of Linda Ronstadt. This package, The Best Of Linda Ronstadt: The Capital Years, is simply outstanding. I discovered her music as I was growing up in the mid 70's. This probably explains why I had never heard several of the songs on this C.D. I cannot think of another artist in modern music who can compete with Ronstadt in singing a ""hard-core"" country song and also equally and impressively singing ""Big Band"" or ""Mexican styled"" music. A sad reality is that today's music executives would not permit Linda Ronstadt be who she really is - a versatile and impressive artist. Simply put, if you are a Linda Ronstadt fan, you will enjoy this collection of her early music!"
"Positive","FACSINATING READ! I WILL READ IT AGAIN!: I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THE STORY AND THE THINGS IT GOT ME TO THINK ABOUT. ANNE RICE AMAZES ME WITH HER IMAGINATION WHERE SHE TAKES US WHEN WE OPEN THE BOOK. LESTAT AND ALL HIS ADVENTURES I HOPE GO ON AND ON. I LOVED THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!"
"Positive","probably the 3rd best: This is probably manson's 3rd best album. Worth it for the most part, although some of the songs just make you want to jam something sharp into your ears repeatedly (mister superstar, Man that you fear) The other tracks (especially beautiful people, irresponsible hate anthem, the reflecting god, and wormboy) more than make up for this. While it is my opinion that GAOG and Holy Wood are better, this is tied with mechanical animals for 3rd. At least it isn't smells like children. So, in summary, great, but not the greatest."
"Positive","I read a book about Jim. It was pretty good.: A few years ago I read one of Jim's Journals. I was in high school, and none of my friends had heard of him. Last year in college, I realized one of my friend's loved Jim. So, when I heard about Treasury, I bought it the first chance I got. The amazing thing about Jim is that he's average. You read through the book and realize life isn't one big joke. It can be boring, and boring can be good. The spice of life is really all the little things that make each day different from the next. It's that your cat woke you up this morining by sitting on your stomach, or that you walked down to the ice cream store only for the scoop to fall off the cone. The ""anti-humor,"" as Dikkers likes to call it, isn't for everyone. In my opinion, in order to ""get"" Jim's Journal, you need to realize that sometimes a joke is funny because the punchline isn't funny at all, or that the funny part of the joke doesn't have to be the punchline, but rather can be the joke."
"Negative","I have never seen this many grammar errors in one book.: I love S&M. Unfortunately, the grammar errors in this book make it almost impossible to read. The continued mistakes, like the use of the word ""then"" every time the author means ""than,"" are extremely distracting. I often had to read sentences more than once to figure out what the author was trying to say. Ms. Antoniou needs an editor."
"Positive","Give this item a try: This product works. It relieves that untouchable, unrelenting pain in the base of my skull that massage and chiropractic hadn't been able to do. After 25 years of chronic neck and shoulder pain, I can move my neck through full range of motion and turn my head without pain. It is simple to use and relaxing after the first 30 seconds or so. It really is a 5 minute fix for me. You have nothing to lose- give it a try."
"Negative","All around: Golf Digest is the quintessential all around golf magazine. They write about lessons, travel, equipment and golf news. They seem to be a little biased recently with the acquisition of many of today's top golf stars, by not writing anything negative about them or their sponsors, i.e. Tiger and Nike. They are usually right on with their reviews of places to play and I enjoy how they pick one location and focus on it. I.e. Cape Cod, the courses that you can play and other activities that are around the vicinity. I wish they would choose some more exotic locales such as South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and South America though."
"Positive","Excellent resource - very user friendly: Can any of us ever agree with 100% of the opinions and recommendations of another professional? No, it just doesn't happen. However, we can appreciate well written and organized reports with detailed recommendations that make implementation a breeze for the reader (be they parent, teacher, therapist, etc.). This CD can significantly add to your library of precise and detailed recommendations. It works well with WORD and other word processors, is searchable, and transferred without a hitch. Will it make you competent in areas you weren't competent in before you got it? No, again. But it will improve your options and offer you new material to consider incorporating. Give it a try, I doubt you'll be disappointed."
"Positive","TEDWHICH: Nice clock- Just a little bigger than I thought from description but really reminicent of the old clocks my parents and Grandparents had.. Wonderful to have a working ""clockwork"" device that still works when power is off and bateries just die on my other devices.. Value OK - if just a liitle expensive when you calculate in the shipping involved..But then I could not buy the equivelent locally!"
"Negative","Outdated: I bought this book because I had read an awesome tale by the same author. Although the volume is interesting by itself (reproducing the original two-column format, with original illustrations), the stories themselves are quite boring and outdated."
"Negative","BEWARE: I THOUGHT THIS WAS FOR THE DISHWASHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT A MESS..NOW I AM STUCK WITH ALL THISSOAP###################NOT FOR DISHWASHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Positive","True story of 1st stages of struggle to free Soviet Jews.: His history and outline of the JDL ideology should be read by every Jew--whether or he or her agrees with Kahane.Read especially what he says about Jabotinsky."
"Positive","Great book: Very easy reading. Clear, and surprsingly thorough. i got it as a gift from a friend, and wos, it was a great gift! extremely funny, and entertaining, so it made it easy and fun to get all the info needed to be a NEW parent. highly recommended!"
"Positive","Something wonderful: Mary is a truly inspiring singer. Her voice floats so easy over the dreamy, Lauryn Hill-penned track ""All that I Can Say."" Guts with emotion on ""The Beautiful Ones"" & spirals through ""Deep Inside."" The strong opening of the album, however, does not make up for the weak finale which includes a washed-up ""I Will Survive""-esque closer. But the song ""Time"" (which deals with late 90s anxiety) is worth the price of the CD alone."
"Positive","Great memories, some question marks....: For the most part, this is an incredible collection of songs that I haven't heard in a really long time. While I honestly cannot remember some of the songs ever being worthy of the title ""hard to find,"" most of the CD did bring back some good memories of good friends, and times when we could actually understand the lyrics of the songs that were popular at the time."
"Positive","I love 'em! I love 'em! I love 'em!!!: I love these aluminum tumblers!! There are almost identical to the ones that Mom had when we were growing up! They still keep everything cold, especially milk.....We highly recommend them!"
"Negative","Does NOT split, It MIRRORS.: Just to clarify this does not actually split your video as in creating a dual or extended monitor. If you are trying to use two monitors and want to be able to display two different images on them then this is the wrong product. I tried this on my PC and even if it did do the job of splitting the video the resolution was awful. I'm going to try the SEE2 USB 2.0 To VGA Ext Video."
"Negative","Not enough practical business travel information: As a frequent visitor to the Silicon Valley area, I find difficulty with the fact that there are still no books directed towards business travelers. This area is NOT a tourist spot, so I found this book, while historically interesting, not particularly helpful for my requirements. Practical advice like, ""good luck finding a room during the week"" was not included."
"Negative","All Library Science, NO Information Science: If your looking for information on how and where to obtain a job in a library, this is a good book. Other than that, the book fails to give you examples on how far a degree in Library and Information Science can take you in the business world. If your not really interested in being a librarian, my advise would be to pick up another book that gives you more options. Or, go back to school and get another type of degree. Your choice."
"Positive","Sounding like a long intro to a Pink Floyd album: Tangerine DreamTangram(Caroline - 1980)By 1980 TD was back into the ambient mode and this one, although good, sounds like a long intro to a Pink Floyd album instead of something exciting and original from these Electronic Music pioneers. However, this is still a solid Four Star album."
"Positive","nice album: nice anniversary album, sure do miss mike's youngers days! huge fan of his though, if you're a fan then you'll prob wanna pick this up but for most of us, we already have the original recording lol! go pick this up if you want, it's still nice to listen to."
"Negative","What a waste: This is the biggest waste of time and money not only mine, but that used to make it. I would say it was a waste of talent, but apparently none was used in the making of this piece of garbage (and thats being kind) this story is weak and incomplete the acting worse then second rate. If I was suppose to care for these characters I never did 20 min. in I wished they'ld jump off a cliff and end the agony (mine) and it never got any better. To erase this movie from exsistance would only improve the world of queer cinema. Don't fall for the hype."
"Negative","So many lies so little time: Even if you hate Bush, the Iraq war and any conservative ideas, this movie is still crap. I spent the my money at the theater so I could at least talk about it. Goebbels would be proud of Moore and his ""movie"" and that is the best thing I can think to say about it."
"Positive","Three Girls who can kick your ...: This game is alot better than I expected it to be, I bought it for my little sister and I end up playing it just as much as she does, If you get this game, it wouldn't hurt to invest in a Memory Card because there are characters to unlock such as MOJO JOJO, FUZZY LUMPKINS AND HIM."
"Positive","making my granddaughter happy: my grand dauther was so happy to have these skates.she can grow with them.i am happy i made the purchase"
"Negative","The Last King: A bit of information to add to J. Bowring's most helpful review:Amazon.co.uk sells both this cut-down A&E; version of the series and the full four-hour BBC version. HOWEVER if you search on ""The Last King"" you will find only the A&E; title you see here. Why? Because the BBC release is titled simply ""Charles II."" Film distributors learned the hard way that when American audiences see a number after a title they assume it is a sequel! So British releases like this or ""Edward VII"" and ""Madness of George III"" are retitled for American release."
"Positive","No need for expensive cables: Not much to say that hasn't already been said. These cables are cheap and they work great. I'd buy again. Highly recommended."
"Positive","doesn't have an ending: I enjoyed this, but it ended abruptly, and did not have an ending. The last DVD ended with drama, with everything up in the air, and amiss. Kind of a bummer."
"Negative","the lining peeled!: i ordered two of these bottles from amazon and and within a month, i noticed the lining on the neck of the bottle started peeling. so i contacted zigg and sent them back for a replacement. it's been a month, and i haven't gotten my replacement. i would recommend the camelbak bottles instead. you don't have to worry about a liner."
"Positive","If you're a law student, you must read this.: This book blows me away. I've finished two years of law school, and PLS has helped me immensely. I've read many law school books, and always come back to this one. (I gave the others away, and have read PLS probably at least 5 times. I will not give this one away.) It has stuff for every phase of preparing to be a lawyer, from high school courses to college on to several chapters on getting a law job. I recommend it to every law student. I also recommend it to every college student even thinking about law school."
"Positive","Apple Tree Christmas a beautiful tale for all seasons: In Apple Tree Christmas, Trinka Hakes Noble gives us a glimpse into her own childhood, although the setting is a Midwestern farm in 1881. Katrina is a budding artist, whose favorite ""studio"" is the old apple tree. Here she gets her best ideas and dreams of the future. After a blizzard/ice storm, the apple tree is no longer standing. Katrina can't believe that Father and Mother are happy to use its old branches for firewood. Nothing seems right anymore, and even Christmas doesn't feel happy. But Christmas morning brings a surprise for our young artist. Mrs. Noble's illustrations are lovely, filled with much detail of life before the turn of the century -- life without all of our modern conveniences. Be sure to add this book to your collection!"
"Negative","ha ha ha ?: ""Where are the laughs?"" one might ask when watching this movie. You will find about 2 genuine laughs and a chuckle here and there. The story went nowhere although it started with lots of potential to be a riot. If you have seen the commercials and previews for this movie, well, lets just say you have already seen the good parts."
"Negative","What a waste of my time: I'm wondering if the people and pubs who wrote those rave reviews of Lent's ""In the Fall"" read the same book I did. I kept reading in the hope that it might get better. It didn't. And the big ""secret"" that supposedly doomed this family was so lame it was criminal. Don't waste your time."
"Negative","complete waste of money: i purchased this item last month because of the extreme heat that i face in my little room. It looked good on the add and small and adjustable, exactly what i was looking for. But unfortunately,it doesn't serve its purpose. Its just like a fan, actually slower than a fan on its high speed. does not cool off my room at all, even though my room is extremely small. i would sleep few inches of it and still dont feel the air. This is the worst experience i ever had with electronics. Also, the water tank came out broken, it would leak water all the time doesnt matter how much water i put on it or how nicely i fix the wash cloth. I couldnt even return it back because i bought it for 40$ + 30$ shipping. i didnt want to pay another 30$ and get nothing out of it. Its a complete waste of money. Dont buy it."
"Negative","Warning do not buy this game!!: If you have a router and plan on running your own server so you and your friends can go head to head like the old 99 Ut , think agian. Even if you know how to port forward, epic programed the game to throw its hands up in the air and say, oh no Nat on a router who would ever do such a thing. Disabling it doesnt work, countless hours google-ing. Nothing , absolute trash. I am thinking of demanding my money back from best buy... Thanks epic, you really let the Ut fans down.$50.00 bucks less for me, and a $50 dollar rip off in your wallet."
"Negative","J-U-N-K!!!: What a disappointment! What a waste of money! Do not buy this toy, nothing about it worked, we spent an hour trying to get it running (putting it together, mixing indredients, waiting for something to happen)to no avail! The directions were complicated, the mixer was messy and leaky, and the motorcycle did not run, even after a number of battery changes. We are returning this worthless piece of plastic junk. Buyer beware!"
"Positive","The other brother Har. Pre. # 533: Kathryn Randle was engaged to Rex Kingersby, Kathryn worked for the Kingersby's, so she took some time off from work with her bosses blessings to drop some of her things off at Rex's flat. Kathryn found him in bed with his secertary Maxine Vernon, and Maxine explained it wasn't the first time, but Rex assured her Maxine meant nothing to him.Kathryn has a thing about faithfulness, and she gave Rex back his ring.Rex was in an accident soon after that, and his older bother Nate came to have Kathryn's head on a slab.Nate and the rest of the Kingersby blamed Kathryn for Rex's accident, all except her immediate boss George.The Kingersby's stared to close ranks against Kathryn, but she hung in there, until the truth came out.I also like Susan Fox, Rebecca Winters, Essie Summers, Betty Neels, Diana Palmer and Eva Rutland."
"Positive","Entertaining comedy for Bujold fans: Bujold's Vorkosigan series is one of the best things going in science fiction. This entry is lighter, less serious, and somewhat less exciting than others. While not reaching the heights achieved by classics such as The Warriors Apprentice and Vor Game, this book still entertains. While at times the book strains to achieve a consistent tone, it is filled with humor, well-drawn characters, and Bujold's trademark epigrams.If you haven't read the other Vorkosigan books, I wouldn't recommend starting here. If your not sure whether you'll like this book, the publishers web site has 10 chapters online..."
"Positive","Family Game Pack: Good for a few games, but there are many I have never heard of and there is little instruction to help you learn. I bought it looking for a cribbage game. The cribbage progran is OK as is the Backgammon. The rest are a waste..."
"Negative","Cheap: This mouse broke after 1 year. It just stopped working completely. No explanation. Otherwise, I felt like the wireless signal was too weak."
"Negative","Workbook/Lab Manual Vol. 1 to accompany Que tal?: Very skimpy little pre-released manual of actual Workbook. Don't buy this unless you think you want to save money when in fact you'll lose money if you don't buy the real workbook."
"Negative","Anne McCaffrey is not here.: Annie's name may be on the cover, but she is not in this book. The torch was passed to Todd and it has gone out. Unfortunatly for Todd, writing talent is not an inherited trait - he does not come close to his mother's talent and I get the sense that Anne has very little input in these new novels. I've continued to read each new one hoping, hoping... My only hope is that Anne will return (if her health allows) to writing her novels alone."
"Positive","Excellent product and low price!: I just got this product and I love it. The curved plates helps curl my ends under but not much it is just right. I had bought a straightener recently for $150.00 and it did not work that great for the money so I returned it. This one was so much cheaper and works like a charm. Great buy!!"
"Positive","This recording is one of the best ever!: I own this masterpiece for about 20 years and everytime I'm listening to it, it has the same unbelievable intensity.To give you an idea of what a great part of the spirit of this recording is about: I like the guitar playing of Satriani, Steve Vai, Buck Dharma, Van Halen, Hendrix, Jimmy Page, Billy Gibbons, Barney Kessel, Eric Clapton, Frank Marino, Steve Howe, Uli Jon Roth, Alex Lifeson, Yngwie Malmsteen, Brian Robertson, Gary Moore, Kirk Hammet, Neil Young, ..., but Micheal Schenker is my absolutely favourite guitarist! In my opinion no one has ever reached Schenkers ability for melody, rythm, timing, or just GOOD TASTE. Schenkers playing on Rock Bottom is worth 6 stars alone.So if you're into good rock music and if you like the sound of an electric (rock) guitar, believe me, you got to have this live-recording!"
"Negative","What Did She See? Nothing, apparently.: I could get more from watching an episode of Beverly Hills 90210 than reading this trite trash. In a free-form babble Ms. Rosenfeld with one swipe spills observations from her uninteresting past romantic life, and blends self indulgence, insecurity and narcissism together into a heroine that one can only assume is a melee of the author's own pathetic truths. Novelists like this give good women writers a bad name. If you're looking for interesting writing, witty observations and even a little depth, a sitcom script would be more enlightening. I'm even wasting my time writing this, but do it in the hopes I will save others from losing precious hours of their life. I hope this is her first and last book."
"Negative","Waste of Money: Waste of money not 320. It sounds muffled in a system, buyers beware.I do not recommend. Should have to advertise bit rate."
"Positive","A Masterpiece: I just finished reading my purchased copy of this book and found it to be the greatest work ever produced on the Motorama Show Cars of General Motors. It is a perfect match of text and pictures (most of which have never been published before)to tell the story of this exciting time in automotive history that probably will never be equaled again by mankind. What a feast for the car lovers of this world and what a triumph for the literary medium! Charles D. Barnette"
"Positive","the jugglers rule: Such a great band! Sux that they broke up! Some really great songs on here....you'd be a fool not to get this album!"
"Positive","They should hav had more stuff!: the dvd's sound really great and i give it a 4/5 rating with all the extra stuff in it but it could have been a 5! they should have put those 3 video clips that started all this ! i wanted to see ""American History"", ""Jesus vs. Frosty"", and ""The Spirit of Christmas"" on thoses dvd's! maybe theres still time to cram these video clips in the dvd's!"
"Positive","Destination Unknown: Destination Unknown by Mest, is such a great CD, their songs are songs that people can relate to, and the catchyness of the songs will stick in your head. This Cd is by far the best cd i've heard yet."
"Positive","An amazing 'period' piece.: The concept is simple and extremely well executed.Several cultural elements are brought out well; violence in our society, naivety about power structures and a sadly typical view of how psycho-active drugs are always a good thing.The interaction between Kropotkin and our hero was something that might well have made Kropotkin proud.Enjoy."
"Positive","Good read: This was a good read - my husband recommended it to me because he knows I like the dystopian romantic futuristic books. It was a little weird at first, but I got really into it and finished the book within a week or two. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's into dystopian romance. The romantic part of this is nothing crazy - just a high school kid crush really."
"Positive","Interesting take on interstellar civilization: It was interesting to read a story about interstellar civilization addressed from the point of view of its affect of instantaneous travel on a planet's economy. It was interesting to see a man from a civilization based on doing a little real work as possible thrown into a civilization of Rational Christians where he is required to do physical labor. All civilizations seem to have all the nanomachines and AI that they want. The reader watches the protagonist grow in understanding of the strengths and failings of himself and the civilizations."
"Positive","charming little book illustrated by artist, Mary Gehr.: This book, published in 1951, is a story about a circus calliope. Although children today have never seen a traveling circus and need to be told what is a circus calliope, I have read it to groups of children (4 to 6 years old) who enjoyed it very much."
"Negative","Poor design: While the handle is easy to grip, it is weighted too heavily. When my toddler places it back in her bowl, it flips out of the bowl and flings food everywhere. I don't see how this flaw was not caught during product discovery and testing. As others say, it does have a wide mouth, so determine if that is good or bad for you. I like the depth of the bowl, I think flat spoons don't allow your toddler to scoop things onto the spoon. Overall, the food flinging aspect at this ridiculous price makes them a rip-off. Sill looking for a good toddler spoon."
"Negative","Eat Your Veggies: I am all for eating fruits and vegetables and this book has some great information. My only complaint was that the menus and weekly meal plans did not contain any food I would eat. Give up dairy? I need it for my osteoporis....I know I can get calcium from other foods...but got to have milk.I found the advice of the book to restrictive."
"Positive","Another great album: This is one of the latest albums to be put out by Bayside on Victory Records and it is once again a great one by the band. They have always put out great music, if you like Bayside also check out A Day To Remember also on Victory Records."
"Positive","This DVD rocks.: This movie is great. I bought the theatrical version of the dvd when it came out a while ago, but this one just blows it out of the water. This version adds a lot to the overall story and plot of the Two Towers(it has 40+ minutes of added story). Having read the book, I was slightly disappointed with the first release(it was still great), but this release includes quite a bit of stuff they left out. For those of you who haven't read the book, the added stuff should immensely help you understand what is going on.As for the extras, they are great. I have watched one disc of the extra's and still have one more to watch. These extra's are a lot of fun to watch because you get to see how they do the special effects(the one about gollum is very interesting), what they changed, and what the actors thought.Overall, this movie is a great buy. The new 40+ minutes is great and you will hardly notice that it is longer. Also, the extra's are great. This is a dvd you will want in your collection."
"Negative","Really wanted to like it but.....: I really wanted to like this but it was just not very interesting. Other reviewers have said it better than I could but the long and short of it is this book is boring.The thing that really sealed it for me was the phrase ""There was a collective gasp of astonishment."" I hate this phrase, and the auther used it several times thoughout the book, once just a couple of pages apart. When he used this phrase it wasn't even for anything that special even. Very lame usage indeed. Please don't buy this book spend your hard earned cash on something better. Get a Jack duBrul book, or a lee Child, or Douglas Preston/ Lincoln Child, anything but this. You will waste your time and money, and that sucks. I keep hoping that this author will improve but after reading all the reviews for his other books I doubt it."
"Negative","Stay away: Stay away from these guys ,30 days and still have not received my order. They never answer email. I have filed clam with Amazon waiting for answer.ONCE AGAIN STAY AWAY DON'T ORDER FROM THEM."
"Positive","Overrated and Still Gets Five Stars!: Not a CD to be worshipped but still has great songs (Stairway, Black Dog, Rock & Roll, 4 Sticks, etc). Overplayed by FM radio and familiarity breeds contempt, I suppose. Even Page & Plant are reluctant to play these songs now."
"Negative","Hi I'm Elmo and I don't like you: When Elmo was delivered he was talking in his box. I giftwrapped him for my nephew and he still talked. Left alone in the middle of the night he would say, ""Elmo needs a good stretch"" and/or laugh maniacally. In short my Elmo was possessed. For long stretches of time he would act like a normal toy that wasn't being touched, i.e. do nothing, but all of a sudden he would start talking and wouldn't stop unless I shook him. After being woken up three times by him I decided it would be wrong to give such a creepy toy to a little boy. I even decided donating it would be wrong too, because then I'm just passing on evil to the less fortunate. I don't know if it was just my toy that did this but I would be cautious. I ended up throwing out my Elmo in the trash and if he ever somehow ends back up in my apartment please someone come and save me."
"Negative","pathetic: One camera focuses on the right side of Johnny Thunders face from a significant distance away for 90 minutes, with fleeting glimpses of Nolan and Kane. Even the audience (I feel like I'm friends with a few of the people after watching them watch JT for the entire show) look bored. I couldn't even finish this. Avoid."
"Negative","review center fold ramp: The ramp is ok, but I was a bit surprised that only 1 ramp was delivered. The picture shows clearly how I want to use it. I believed it was a set for that price."
"Positive","Great Horror: This book has many classics like ""The Loved Dead"" and ""The Parasitic Hand."" It has something for every horror fan."
"Negative","Not My Favorite: I am a devoted reader of Ms. Perry's Monk & Pitt novels; but I must say that this book is a far cry from her best. Her character development is usually spot on and the reader usually has a myriad of possible culprits from which to choose. However, this reader was left wondering if the author allowed her parlormaid to write the book as the ending was so implausibly and melodramatically far-fetched."
"Negative","Knife Sharpener: DONT buy this Sharpener!!! I got this sharpener for Christmas along with a buck knife. I attempted to sharpen the knife and scratched the knife really bad! Keep looking!"
"Positive","outstanding flavor on the grill and healthy too: I use this book almost everyday, not just because it is healthy, but also because everything i cook tastes so good. Instructions are easy to follow and are not complicated. There are many colored photos in this book which show me what a dish is to look like. I especially enjoy the layout and the book is printed on good paper stock, so it can be ""wiped off"". If you like to grill, this book is a MUST for you. Cristopher Laus 2-23-00"
"Positive","A fantastic trip thru classical and trad English/Irish music: Would have rated album 5 stars, but for the lack of adequate documentation of the music on it, a shortcoming of many soundtrack albums! Otherwise, a very enjoyable album. It must be noted that some of the classical selections are adaptations of the original pieces. For example, the Schubert trio is significantly different than the original composition. As for the Vivaldi ""E minor cello concerto"", or whatever it is, I have not been successful in finding the original composition on disc, even after an exhaustive search on amazon.com. The 4-volume set of Vivaldi cello concerti on the Naxos label, which I just purchased, claims to be relatively complete, yet does not contain this composition. Can anyone out there help?"
"Negative","Pedicure kit: Ordered this for the pedicure tools but they are small and hard to work with. Probably be okay for kids feet."
"Negative","I NEVER GOT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: YOU GUYS SUCK! I NEVER GOT THIS BOOK AND HAVE A PAPER DUE SUNDAY NIGHT! I BORROWED A COPY FROM A FRIEND AND WROTE 18 PAGES WORTH OF NOTES SO THAT I WOULD HAVE THE MATERIAL I NEEDED TO ATTEMPT TO WRITE THIS PAPER!!!!!!!!!!! YOU GUYS SUCK! THE POST OFFICE HAD TO OPEN AN INVESTIGATION TO FIGURE OUT WHY I NEVER GOT THE BOOK AND WHERE IT IS. THANKS ALOT."
"Positive","I am almost sure your family, like mine: IS SICK AND TIRED OF THE SAME OLD SANDWICHES...This RECIPE BOOK GIVES YOU A THOUSAND NEW IDEAS FOR WONDERFULL FILLINGS...TASTY, ORIGINAL, MARVELOUS !JUST USE A FINE BREAD AND THE FILLINGS WILL ACCOMPLISH THE REST !"
"Positive","Good hard drive: Bought this 500 gb ext hard drive. I read lots of review about it. Came out of the box working well. I leave it on for the surv. video at my business. It hasn't shut down unexpectedly yet. A+"
"Negative","Disapointing: Poor pictures, a very slim book and lots of shortcuts in the quality department made this a big disapoinment. This one's worth the trip to the Post office to return."
"Negative","Second repair in three years!!: This product is shameful. I paid $2400 USD for this refrigerator and it has not met my expectations of a Maytag unit. The compressor is now broken with less than three years of use. I am very Very disappointed!"
"Negative","Buy a cheap cd boom box instead!!: Not loud enough! Shuts off after cd is played, I wanted a repeat button. CD skips alot, light is too dim. The positive point is that it clips nicely to the crib."
"Positive","Graphics card: The e-GeForce FX 5200 128MB GPU was an upgrade made to an older Dell Dimonsion 4600 machine with minimum graphics capabilities since the original purchase. The increased graphics capabilities provided support for larger monitors at higher resolution and was certainly worth the meager price to upgrade."
"Negative","cheap isn't everything: Pros: Cheap for the capacityCons: poor audio quality, browsing songs stops currently playing music, no support for playlists, no firmware updates, short warrantycustomer service has promised firmware updates due by the end of the month for 3 consecutive months and still hasn't produced a firmware update to fix any of the shortcomings of this unit. spend the extra money and get an ipod mini.90 days is all govideo feels confident in warranting their products. I've waited over 90 days for promised firmware updates from govideo to fix all the shortcomings of this product, now i'm out of warranty. stay away from govideo."
"Positive","Brings back Memories.: I remember the first time I watched this I had just started first grade. I cried and it still brings me to tears over Mufasa. It is an all time classic and probably the greatest children's movie of all time so when I saw it coming out on DVD i knew i had to get it to share a part of my childhood with my niece and nephew. Also, admittedly I had to get a copy for myself too. It is one of those children's movies that you never outgrow and for everyone in the family."
"Positive","This book helped me: Remember to be ready to go through the grief and touch on things that may be hard. A great book to share with a circle of like minded women. I joined a wonderful group on yahoo called motherlessdaughters and they lifted me up and I lifted them up. The group owners name was Vicky if you ever get a chance."
"Negative","Do NOT Buy This Movie: I honestly couldn't watch more than fifteen minutes of this train wreck. The writing is terrible to the point of nausea, and Lex, Lois, and Braniac are so far out of their established characters that it isn't funny. And I mean that literally, since the writer seems to be trying to play them for laughs.Had I seen this on Cartoon Network before purchasing it (I'd pre-ordered it the day I'd heard about it, months ago, based on the strength of the original series and Justice League), I'd have never wasted my money."
"Negative","Don't be fooled by the preview: I saw the preview for this movie and thought it'd bepretty funny. The Napolean Dynamite scene is one of thehighlights,and that occurs in the first scene. Unfortunately,it's all downhill from there. A big chunk of the movie isparodies of Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers. Tryingto parody a classic comedy is like going to karaoke night andtrying to sing a Celine Dion song. At best, it's tolerable.Worst case scenerio, well.... you get the idea. Nowhere nearas funny as the Scary Movie movies."
"Negative","Cheap Starter Assembly and Far Distant Repair Shop: The starter handle and its assembly snapped off after about 20 uses. I should have looked before I purchased, but was surprised to find that the nearest Black and Decker repair facility (according to their web site) was 2 round-trips of 60 miles each. (total of 60 miles to take it, and 60 miles to retrieve it after repairs.)Fortunately, I was able to find an authorized repair shop just 5 miles away, but they were not listed on the B&D; website."
"Positive","Best Baby Swing: My son loves this swing. He is 8 months old and has taken good long naps in it since we brought him home from the hospital. It is also great for Mom because baby is entertained in this swing by the mobile and the toy bar. So Mom has time to get a shower,do laundry, dishes ect. It is lightweight. I carry it from room to room with me. I am a first time Mom and this swing is the best baby item we have bought. If you are on a limited budget, this would be the one extra item I would buy."
"Positive","Love it!: I just loved this sitcom. I forgot how funny it was till I bought the seasons on DVDs. Great show."
"Positive","Prussian Lovers: This book is a great book for anyone interested in the 1813-1814 period of the Napoleonic Wars, most notably with an emphisis on Prussia. It is a rear find in the English language and hope the author will write more on the subject. This ranks up there with the works of Digby Smith, Highly recommended."
"Positive","Enjoyable read and great characters: The characters made this book. They were very likeable and I wanted them to have a happy ending. I didn't find the story riveting but I liked it well enough and will be ordering Roth's story. The ending was a little confusing to me when all of the pieces were being put together. I was thinking, ""Now who is that?..."" Perhaps if I had read the first in the series I may have been aware more of who some of the villains were..I guess. But overall the story was entertaining and I will continue to read this author."
"Negative","This Is Only Half a Movie and Not Much at That: Jeremy Renner is brilliant. I can not say that for the rest of this film, however. This film is slow and methodical to the point that the viewer actually begins to lose interest. It finally picks up the pace and brings a lot of pieces together to what I imagined to be an explosive finale of drama and heroics and discovery of who is who in this complex film. But, that never happens. The film ends in in the middle of the story in my opinion, and the opinion of many others I spoke with. This film had a good idea, but the filmmakers could not pull it off. Basically, this film lacks the narrative flow that it so desperately needed to entertain and draw the viewer in. Jeremy Renner gives an interesting performance., but he can't save this film alone. My expectations were much higher."
"Positive","Best Ever: This is one of the best products that are available to use on stuck fasteners. It takes care of the job. Soak the fastener and let the time to take care of the rust and try to wrench it. My results are much better than competitors..."
"Positive","cross light: bought for wife, she loves it. especially when center lights up showing Christ on cross. automatically goes off in 30secondsThe included instructions say to touch frame and center will light up. NOT SO, Has a sensor that turns light on as you walk by. also must be in a lit room for light to work. will not come on in dark room."
"Positive","BARBARELLA Blue-ray screen ratio: BARBARELLA: The product specs above, quotes the screen ratio of the Blue-ray version that is about to be released as 1.85:1. I hope this is incorrect as this masterpiece of campy science fantasy was shot at 2.35:1 and the version I have on DVD is from a poor quality (scratched and dirt marked) projection print. Any body know any different? Please speak up.Brian"
"Positive","this CD kicks some major butt: this CD is one of the coolest CD's that I.C.P has ever made and if you don't think so you can bite it because if you're a true juggalo you won't care what it sounds like you'll just listen to it and love it."
"Positive","Love it: I really loved it ---I can see better out of the car window and it stay the same height -- Its very well made and it looks very nice"
"Negative","Cindy: This item is a cheap cassette player. I will be buying a better one in time. Bulky.. but it does play ok. The headsets are also on the cheap side... I got what I paid for."
"Positive","good: Different out look to communicate with our beloved companions, easy to read, bring a lot of read experiences, definately a good tool to open our mind to possible dialogue"
"Positive","Just what I needed: I bought this lithium grease to aid the assembly of a Schwinn Elliptical machine and it did a great job. I've since used it in a few scenarios where I might have just reached for WD-40. Good stuff."
"Negative","Plenty of Drama: ""Plenty"" by David Hare is a fascinating portrait of a woman searching for happiness and stimulation after a secret, thrilling youth working for the French Resistance. Susan is perhaps David Hare's most interesting character ever. This play is one of the most unpredictable that I have read lately. I highly recommend it, particularly for David Hare lovers."
"Positive","Fantastic movie: This is without doubt the best movie I have ever seen, and I have seen them all. I would rate this as better than Gone With The Wind. JT"
"Positive","works well but noisy: comfortable and sharp blades. Seems to hold up pretty well to seasonal usage with a few small shrubs. You'll need some earplugs, but it won't wake the neighborhood like a gas one will"
"Positive","What glorious prose!: How fortunate am I to have vicariously strolled through the Tuscan countryside, partaking of the food, feeling the sunlight, glimpsing village life. I lingered among the pages of this book as long as possible, relishing every detail--some of which I read aloud to my husband--, laughing, marveling at the visual paintings of pastoral scenes. I appreciated the opportunity to share in this life for awhile, to learn some Italian, and to enjoy the slower pace of life."
"Positive","SunPro Tachometer: I purchased this product because I wanted a shift light that I could set. When I'm winding out gears, I don't want to take my eyes off the road. With a shift light,I can keep my eyes on the road and know exactly when to shift.Plus it's a handsome and effective instrument.Satisfied Customer"
"Positive","Just what I was searching for: I am very pleased with this purchase. It was just what I was searching for in a weight scale. I would have liked a few more extras, but performs as intended."
"Negative","Exciting Premise, Boring Writing: I heard about this book on Dennis Prager's radio show. The plot and subject intrigued me, so I ordered it. The writing is bland and the characters are impossibly dull. This book made me appreciate Dean Koontz more. Koontz is not the greatest writer in the world, but you will do worlds better with him if you want to read X-Files-ish stories about occultish premises like reincarnation."
"Positive","Extracts a lot of juice!: Great solution for making mixed drinks w/ fresh squeezed lemons and limes. Since that is what I primarily bought this item for, I am satisfied. Other reviews suggested lemons might be too big. I have had pretty good luck juicing lemons w/ it. I imagine most oranges would be too big and obviously grapefruits wouldn't work out too well (maybe in the wedge form?).The tool works very well. Found that after squeezing out the majority of the juice, you can take the rind out of the tool cut a slit into the rind and place it back into the press to get even more juice to get the best mileage out of the citrus.The one issue I have had w/ this item is that occasionally a very fine stream of juice will spray out from the side of it, this isn't much of a problem if you are juicing a lemon over a plate of fish, but not as desirable if you are trying to get the juice into a highball glass..."
"Negative","The inconclusive ending [threw] me off.: This was a great book, mostly. Shawn McDaniel has cerebral palsy really bad. He has a lot of seizures and no voluntary muscle control. Everyone thinks he's an idiot, a vegetable, because he can't communicate to them how smart he is. He can't even focus his eyes half the time. Shawn's voice left a strong impression and the story -- Shawn's fear that his father was going to kill him to ""put him out of his misery"" -- was original and very good.So why did you rate it a two out of five? you ask. Because the ending really made me mad. You never find out whether his dad killed him or not. It was like the author couldn't make up his mind and was like ""aw, the heck with it"". The ending left me hanging, with a bad taste in my mouth.It was very good but due to the last chapter I could not honestly recommend it to anybody."
"Positive","Missing from my collection: ""The Best Buddhist Writing 2006"" is a volume I have been missing in my collection. I don't know how this happened, but I'm very glad I now have a copy!All the articles are excellent and I have really enjoyed reading them."
"Positive","I never wanted it to end.: What woman wouldn't love Gabriel? Just the thought of having someone watch over me the better part of my life, sent chills through me. Good chills. Gabriel watched Sara grown into a beautiful (though sad) young woman. When all hope was gone and she felt as though she couldn't take it anymore, she tried to take her life. Gabriel stops her in the guise of her guardian angel. Sara went from thinking she was worthless, to knowing she was loved. Their story of love contiued to grow from that point. Sara is very innocent in the ways of.......well everything. Gabriel is just the man to help her grow and learn. Is it his fault he just happens to be a vampire? This book brings a smile to my face and warm feelings of love to my heart everytime I think of it. A must read!"
"Positive","Great product: Let me say, the Omron has really helped me keep track of my blood pressure. This unit works exactly as advertised. I am a bodybuilder and the large cuff works great for me.TipsThe main thing to remember is to get the cuff tight enough before starting the monitor or it will not inflate properly and stop."
"Positive","A great party game: If you are familiar with Balderdash, the name of this game will give you a good idea about what it is, if not...Beyond Balderdash is a fun and funny game to play with a group of people. You can play with 3, but a truly enjoyable game will require 4-6 people minimum.The game involves an obscure word, person, date, acronym, or movie title, and then having the players come up with their what they think the real answer is.This is a creative game that showcases the players ability to think of funny and creative responses, while learning obscure trivia in the process. I imagine it could get old, but I've been playing it for several years, and its still enjoyable."
"Negative","Worst transaction with Amazon Ever!: Usually my purchases with Amazon are flawless, so I am saddened to have to write a bad review.This Bike came to us with the box crushed and literally broken and punctured held together with tape, I looked inside but really could not tell if everything was in there so we accepted it from Fed-XWe were missing several parts that we were going to try and just get from Amazon to make it work out, with out sending it back; however when my husband went to put on the front tire we noticed the front forks were severly bent, he said it had to have been run over by a truck and would not be something repairable. In all fairness this is the ONLY time we have ever gotten a bad item from Amazon and they were very good to take it back without a hassle so we will continue to shop with them in the future."
"Negative","heath zenith is junk: Heath Zenith products are JUNK! I have purchased their motion detector floodlights that do not even come on when I drive my car right under them!Real crap."
"Negative","Another Gift that was Unappreciated: I ordered KINGDOM CROWN for my husband, who is an avid reader. I never read the book. When I asked him for a review, he couldn't remember the book, so I gather it wasn't very well written or interesting."
"Positive","Very pleased: I was very pleased with my purchase of the Orchestral music stand. It arrived in a timely manner and was not damaged. I use it to hold my lesson material when I teach scripture at a rehab. center. I would like for it to have been a little lighter to carry but it is built rugged to last over time. I would recommend it to anyone."
"Negative","buyer BEWARE!: This was the worst pair of headphones I've ever bought, and it was not easy to get the local Bose store to give me a full refund on them despite their advertised ""no hassle refund"" policy.Terrible sound, poor ergonomics, medicore ""noise cancellation""---never again will I buy another Bose product! I should've known better, my husband has a ridiculous Bose Wave radio which he now tells everyone that he ""won at a Christmas raffle at the office"" because he's too embarassed to confess that he paid half a grand for the thing.My son pointed me towards a pair of Sennheisers which were better in every respect, and at one third of the price."
"Positive","You must read! it's a woderful captavating story!: I loved this book! You will not be disapointed. I love Julie Garwood and must say that this one was her best. You'll love all the characters. The heroine and the hero are lovable. This is well worth the money and you'll want to read it over agian. I defenitly have!"
"Positive","Great Little Book: Well written - cute tricks that aren't hard.... I took this book step by step and made sure my dog knew each one in succession. Tricks are built upon other commands.... - so it's not a 'fast book'.... sometimes it take a week to get to the next one. Great suggestions though."
"Positive","The one an only: dark side of the moon as got nothing on this album this is lates 60's acid freak out trippy (as your partents would say) is all about the high poit of that era or any era Syd is a master of music and any one you donsen't agree can eat chain I mean don't get me wrong I love the work of Roger Waters as well Roger was pink floyd just about but who created them no other then Syd so all you cheap sort of wanna-bes you can keep you wall and dark side and I'll enjoy the first Floyd at there best"
"Positive","Graphics are exceptional: Bought it for my two boys since they liked the Turismo series. Arcade play was lacking but the classic Turismo formula was excellent. Very realistic and great graphics. I liked MotorStorm: Pacific Rift better than GT5 Pro but only because the arcade style Motorstorm let me play head to head with my sons. You won't go wrong with either."
"Negative","Daughter loves it but...: the area around the velcro has already started to fray. This was a Christmas gift so she has not had them long. I think that the quality should be better. The knee pads and elbow pads do seem to protect well."
"Positive","Damned good: I give this album 4 stars....it's grwat but I don't end up rememebering the songs as much as preevios albums. I realize that all bands change somewhat and this album is just a bit different. Any VGS fans will love it and anyone who doesn't like frank and the rest ought to be ashamed of themselves."
"Positive","Rarities from the Malaco vaults.: This compilation focuses almost exclusively on rarities and previously unreleased tracks from the Malaco label's vaults. Malaco, of course, is probably one of the very few labels still recording and releasing REAL Soul music and this collection gives you a good overview of the label's sound an d style. The songs by Sam Dees, Dorothy Moore, The Patterson Twins, Tommy Tate, Anita Mitchell, Charles Warren and Carolyn Faye are my favorites but the whole CD is very good. Both ballads and more uptempo tracks are featured here."
"Negative","Broken when received.: I opened this item to find one of the long standup wooden sided almost completely snapped in half where the crossbar is attached to it. Can't even say yet whether it's good or not; I'm ordering another because I really need this before Christmas and am hoping it's OK."
"Negative","Bad Product: The idea is great but this product is implemented very poorly. Problems:1. buggy, it crashes all the time. Reminds me of the good old Windows 3.1 days. Very very annoying.2. Codec Support is pretty substandard. Many videos in my collection can't be opened.I was willing to tolerate #2 but #1 sealed it's fate. It's going back to Amazon in a couple of days."
"Positive","A golden gem! The best!: Over the years I've owned two copies of this, and recently had to buy a third - alas, again only available in VHS. I wish they would release it on DVD. This is one I love sharing with friends. In DVD, I'd be able to give it as gifts to new friends. I enjoy watching it, but how wonderful it is to show this one for the first time to someone who has never seen it. I've done this so many times, and everyone who sees it wants it. Truly it is ""wonderful"" from the heart!! But, then Ruben Blades ALWAYS makes magic in all his many ranges of creative talents. Gracias Ruben!"
"Negative","DON'T Bother: I bough this one to replace my old one. LONG/SHORT..My old one works better. Debating returning it, but probably not worth the effort."
"Negative","A little lacking: I bought this book while in the brainstorming phase of my outdoor kitchen. Incidentally it's STILL in that phase, and this book did not advance my cause at all. It had good reviews and I was hoping it would have good ideas and planning tools. Instead, it seems to focus on only a handful of actual kitchens, and doesn't really cover much ground. It does not have any recommendations on building YOUR kitchen as far as usage of space, appliance placement, etc. There is ZERO cost information as well, so if you are hoping for help shaping your kitchen budget, this also is not the tool. It has some moderately useful technical information, but not nearly enough to let you build anything unless you already knew how, in which case...you wouldn't need the book. Basically, it's got some nice pictures of some pretty sweet kitchens that might give you an idea here and there; that's about it."
"Positive","The Kindle: I recently bought a Kindle Wireless Reading Device. I absolutely love it! I have already read several books and it was very easy to use. I love the ""dictionary"" feature where you can easily click on a word and instantly get the definition. I have learned so many new vocabulary words because it is so easy to use. I also love the ability to change the font to larger print. Reading has never been easier. Being able to download a book any time of the day or night is also so convenient. I have nothing negative to say at this point. I love my Kindle!"
"Negative","Action packed but hard to enjoy: It is the newest thing for hollywood directors to give you the moving camera action shot. To my knowledge the new James Bond Series does it most...and best. However there have been tons of other films that have attempted to emulate this technique and have failed..sadly 12 rounds is one of them. The moving camera is supposed to give the viewer the feeling of being in the action, or an actual by stander to it..and does work sometimes. The problem with 12 rounds is that there is barely a steady shot in the whole film. This film seems like it was directed by a first time director with no real concept of filming a movie. Instead of feeling like you are at the scene of the action, the busy camera is distracting and diminishes from what might have been a better film in the hands of a more competent director....and Mr. Cena..doesn't help..he's not the greatest lead...and needs better support in front of and behind the camera if he is going to shine."
"Negative","One of Worst Movies of the Year: This is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent years. I really like both stars, but they should be embarrassed to be part of such a poorly written & executed movie. The fake scenery of ""Florida""...who knew the keys had mountainous terrain....looks like the Virgin Islands to me! C'mon that's just a basic that the setting should at least be realistic. The story line is weak and the humor is so predictable. This movie overall is just a waste of time and energy."
"Positive","Lovely Laura!: My daughter Laura suggested I try to locate a copy of this old film, informing me she'd never seen it. She enticed me to do a quick scramble to find ""Laura"" by saying we could watch it together when she visited during the holiday season. On Christmas night we treated ouselves to freshly popped popcorn, soda, individual boxes of candies, then dimmed the lights and watched ""Laura"" with our Laura! Was new to her; brought back memories for me!"
"Positive","The Fast and the Furious: This movie was different, kept my attention and had a great sound track!!! I liked it!!!"
"Positive","A family classic: Our family is now sharing this great movie with a second generation. The story of a funny man who steals the childrens toys in order to have some fun is one in which young children become totally engrossed, they care for the children, the toys and for funny Dunderklumpen. Great songs fabulous dialog. A classic for our family and an absolute joy to watch, over and over again."
"Negative","Drizzt vs Liriel: There are two distinct visions of what Menzoberanzan really is. One, is that of Drizzt, the Salvatore character. The other is Liriel, the Cunningham character. I have read all the books by both authors, and they are all well written. The primary difference is that each character undergoes differing sets of circumstances. Drizzt is a noble male raised in a violent matriarchal society. Liriel is a noble female in the same society. Liriel, through her series of books, has to learn the lessons of honor and loyalty, not mention responsibility and proper behavior because it was never taught to her. Liriel's story is the the female perspective of drow culture. Drizzt's is the male. As a reader of both, I found Salvatore did not really emphasize female perspective. To truly understand the drow cities, be it Menzoberanzan of Ched Nasad, both authors are a must read."
"Negative","Sony DRU-720UL: This was a great burner until it stopped burning DVDs, after about 20 successful burns. It still burns CDs and reads DVDs, but every attempt to burn a DVD results in a ""power calibration error."" Same Memorex DVDs that used to work don't anymore. Searching the net revealed many other users of this product had the same problem. There is no fix. The product is now ready for the dust bin."
"Positive","A quick correction: The Editorial Review on this page is incorrect when it says that Moonheart is set in Newford. Moonheart is in fact set in Ottawa."
"Positive","Good story...decent writing: If you are a fan of the warcraft games and lore, then you will likely enjoy this book. It follows a good story line and sets up the following two books in the series nicely. My only complaint deals with (and I know this may sound picky) the author's over and often incorrect use of the word ""latter."" It became more and more frequent towards the end of the book and got to the point that it was being used in nearly every paragraph, and often when it was incorrect grammar to do so. Again...it's a minor deal and one that could have been solved with some simple edits, but overall the book was good and I would recommend it. I have since moved on to book two of the trilogy and will continue to the conclusion in book three. Overlook the minor stuff and you've got yourself a read."
"Negative","very sad: you can tell that the show in dubling was great, exciting and beautiful, and you wished you were there, but watching this video just makes you wanna talk to those who made it. you want to see it so much....and you cant!!!!!!the only thing you see is the camera changing constantly and some feets....you dont see the beautiful dance and the whole experience from watching this dvd is DISAPOINTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!if you like the irish dance this dvd is unuseful......it is horrible and makes you very mad because you want to see it so much and can't and can't do anything about it either!!!!!dont buy it, waste of money and energy!"
"Positive","Great substitute for veggies: this product was also recommended by my alternative doctor to add to my diet since I do not eat enough vegetables, this helps..."
"Negative","This is absolutely awful: My heart breaks for all the children of people who believe this insane advice. This book starts from the view that all people are born ""bad"" and must be molded into a decent human being. The Pearls seem to believe that hitting is a good way to do that molding.They even suggest using a ""switch"" or a stick on a 4 month old baby!?! That is simply cruel- there is not other way about it.I think that it is terrible that these so-called Christians are preying on other's fears of their children not becoming good people.This is definitely abuse!"
"Positive","Love it, very applicable: I loved this book! I found it to be an easy read and very applicable to my life as both a mother of two small children and also an elementary school counselor. I have recommended it to friends and also to parents of students I work with."
"Negative","2012 doomsday..... I wish it was!!!: DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!! I was absolutely appaled by the seriously bad acting and awful effects! At one point we actually saw the camera man's reflection in the car door! the trailer is the whole movie just a much shorter version, and to be honest would be much easier to watch!Please please please do not waste your time!!!! Its now an hour of my life that I cannot get back! And a complete waste of money!!!"
"Negative","Don't bother: I am so frustrated by this printer and I've only had it a couple months. Sometimes it works fine, other times I get an error message. Yesterday I could use the scan feature, today it keeps giving me a message stating that the device is in use by another user (there are no other users) even after re-booting twice. It no longer lets me print wirelessly either - that just stopped working out of the blue. Software slows down the computer. It isn't even that fast to print. If you want fast, buy a laser. If you want quality, buy a Canon."
"Negative","Disappointing: The first book in this trilogy was an engaging and thoughtful thriller, a what-if change in history. The 2nd and 3rd parts after Christ clone veer more towards preaching without the hook of a good novel. Too bad."
"Positive","Dog Heaven: Written by a true dog lover! Cynthia Rylant understands the comfort that other dog lovers need when they lose their pets. She fills that need with sweetness and whimsy and just enough sentiment to bring a tear and a smile. I gave this book to a friend who had just lost her little dog very prematurely, and she loved it."
"Negative","bad package: due to bad package book twisted and pages damaged.please be more careful .. . . . . . . . . ."
"Negative","Would not repurchase.: I bought this because my laptop was having serious overheating issues. Not only could I feel the base being extremely hot, it had started to some times turn off randomly due to the overheating. Maybe the laptop was too far gone and this cooling pad was too late a purchase. Regardless, it did not help the case at all. Look elsewhere."
"Positive","A good introduction to the tragedies.: Romeo and Juliet is a beautiful story, and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of Shakespeare. Who doesn't like to read or hear about star-crossed lovers? Who hasn't already heard the legend? The play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly, and it's beautifully written. Romeo and Juliet are so tragic in their love, and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless. Read it for the story, but enjoy it for the beautiful prose."
"Positive","A GUY musical!!: I just LOVE this movie! In spite of an idiotic story and outrageous overacting (mostly from Kelly) this movie a sheer delight! Kelly and Sinatra pretty much repeat their roles from ""Anchors Aweigh"": Kelly as the womanizing man about town, and Sinatra as the shy bumpkin. Esther Williams is delicious as the woman who takes over their baseball team, and Betty Garrett as the woman who has the hots for Sinatra (don't we all?) just steals every scene she's in. The highlights are Kelly singing and dancing to ""The Hat my Father Wore,"" and Garrett wooing Sinatra with ""It's Fate, Baby, It's Fate."""
"Positive","Good Reading Selection: ""Dogism"", is a interesting points dealing with low self-esteem. This is a book that I think in my own opinion will help someone out who's dealing with the same problems. Keep up the GOOD work Mark Anthony!!!Q.U.E.E.N.S. Book Club of Atlantaqueensbookclubofatlanta@yahoo.com"
"Positive","Cowboy Baby is so loveable!: I have bought this book now 4 times as a gift, which is especially notable considering that it is out of print. I can't imagine why this incredible book would ever be out of print! Children interested in cowboys are especially drawn to this adorable story, but it is really appealing to all children. Cowboy Baby is just adorable. Sue Heap's best work."
"Negative","Disappointed !!!: Very disappointed that no amulets came with the book. I have tried to find another source to buy the amulets with absolutely no luck."
"Positive","Now I have to see the play...: I originally bought the CD because of the soundtrack (tease) for an advertisement on the radio. The song was so upbeat and fun I couldn't resist. After receiving and listening to the CD I can't wait to see the play/musical."
"Positive","Decency Taken to the Superlative: Ben Stein's book was just wonderful in an entirely pleasant, decent and thoughtful way. His devotion to his family and household is not much more than what everyone's should be, but on a little reflection it is a marvelous and almost unheard of example of what ought to be but seldom is today. Mr. Stein's pursuits and accomplishments are too numerous and varied to repeat here, but he surpasses all of them in his level of (I say it again) decency. More importantly, his stories and reflections about Tommy and other friends serve as a genuine model for others to live up to and Stein never in the least part succumbs to a temptation to preach or talk down. After reading Tommy and Me, I get the impression that in addition to being a writer, television host, lawyer and economist he could have done quite well as a clergyman too."
"Positive","Very Good first..: This is a very good first book in this series. I thought the politics and intrigue was great. The family ties and confilics was really great. This book was a great read.. I highly recommend it."
"Negative","not comfortable: I was very disappointed upon receiving these sneaks. I am a true Asics fan and only buy Asic sneakers. This particular model is more narrow than any other. They are also not as deep, so I am unable to put my instep inserts into the shoe and still be comfortable. I would not recommend these shoes to anyone who enjoys how Asics feel, as these are not representative of any other model i have tried (KAyano's, 1110's, 2110's, 2120'3. 2130's)."
"Negative","Grating: I found Owen to be a sullen little snot, making it impossible for me to have any sympathy for him or his plight. His story became one I could care less about. As with all of Avi's books, this one was well written, pity the main character was intolerable."
"Negative","Got screws: We purchased two Winsome Wood Night Stands which arrived promptly. My husband quickly put the first night stand together with a few expletives. It took him about a half hour because his power drill wasn't working and the instruction were just adequate. However, when he turned the table over the four letter words flew along with screwdrivers, empty box and almost the cat and dog! The screws were SO LONG THEY went right through the top of the night stand!!!!!!The tables stand with our bed between. They are better than the cardboard round tables they replaced. The extra shelf is great for books and our dual CPAP machines. I haven't used the drawer yet.Overall the tables are poorly engineered. Even when my husband put the second table together with more awareness of the long screws these screws still went through the top!!!! They also look cheap. The wood is thinner than it appears in the pictures."
"Positive","a great tribute to a great band: Anne Clarke doesn't know what she is talking about. This tribute album is a must buy for anyone who is a fan of The White Stripes. The attention to detail that the performers captured is amazing and I could literally sing along with the songs even though there were no vocals. Overall I would fully recomend this to anyone who enjoys The White Stripes. This a wonderful album to listen to and it deserves a spot up on your shelf next you your White Stripes albums."
"Positive","Invaluable Resource Guide That's Fun to Flip Through: Just a quick note to say how much I enjoyed the record book, it has some amazing stats and information in it and I couldn't stop reading it! Who would have thought that Yankees great Roger Maris still holds a national football record? As the book is current through the 2000 season, I was surprised at how many records have been broken this past year... like David Koral and his 764 yards passing in a game... the book explained that no NFL quarterback has ever passed for more than 557 (Ty Detmer) and I thought that was interesting too. I would recommend the book to coaches, parents and players or just fans of high school football... it's really a must have!!"
"Positive","Leading Edge: Real Estate is an industry ready for change, and Lennox Scott is embracing technology, the Internet, and ""one stop shopping"" as the key to keeping real estate agents at the center of property purchases and sales."
"Negative","Overrated ""Classic"": I had been urged to read ""The Awakening"" several times, and had heard the word ""classic"" used to describe this book, so I thought I'd check it out. And while I understand that this must have been controversial when it first appeared, this same theme has been done much better by later writers. This is a BORING read. Not much happens. There isn't much conflict. I didn't like or sypathize with the main character, who comes off as selfish and cold. I would not recommend this, except in a study of feminist literature. The other stories are pretty much the same as the title story -- slow and plodding. I'm a fan of literature and theme, but this is light on both. Avoid this book."
"Positive","Best I've Viewed: Over the years I've seen many performances of this opera both live and on tape. This currently is at the top of the list. Ellina Garanca IS CARMEN from head to toe and embodies her in everything she does, her looks (beautiful, erotic), singing (lovely), dancing (appropriately exciting and provocative(and acting. Only way this performance could have been better for mne if YOUNG Placido Domingo had been Don Jose. However, Alagna came close and both acted and sang very well. The whole cast is to be commended but especially the young conductor Nezet-Seguin whose conducting was sensitive to cast and music throughout. He's one of the relatively, new young, extremely talented conductors on the scene today. Glibert (NYPHIL) and Dudamel (LAPhil)are the others. Opera and Classical Music fans have much to look forward to."
"Positive","Super good!: I love this stuff! I am a fan of Aveeno products, I use the face wash and daytime cream. This night cream just added to my wonderful collection. I feel a difference after a month of using it. Its light and not too greasy, but moisturizing at the same time."
"Positive","painting landscapes: 152 pp, 8 "" x 11"", 24 pages of color and 50 b/w illustrations. This is an ""idea book"" of 74 specific, inventive, off-beat approaches to painting landscapes. Each idea is illustrated by examples from leading realistic and abstract artists."
"Positive","Pyramid PS 14KX: This a good enough power supply at a great price. I have not tested it for voltage fluctuation or ripple current but it should be OK for most non-precision uses. I have used other Pyramids on critical electronics than need a 12 volt power supply without extra caps with no problems which, for the price, is high praise. Why pay more or build your own?"
"Negative","cheap ripoff: This book just seemed like a bad ripoff from the Outlander Series by Diana Gabaldon. It was boring and I had a hard time finishing it. I don't care about the characters because they are so one dimensional. Read the Outlander series if you want good writing, good stories and outstanding characters!!!"
"Negative","I like Avent Products, All except this warmer: I received this warmer as a gift and had to return it. The warming of bottles was very inconsistent, there was no way to accurately measure the amount of water needed for each bottle and you had to unplug it each time you used it. There are other great warmers that have pre-measured water holders that allow for hassle-free bottle warming. Avent has great products however they need to work on this product."
"Positive","RAM Works Fine: I received the order as promised and installed 1GB to increase my maximum to 2GB. I removed two 256MB RAM modules pairing the two 1GB since I read it is better if they are all the same. So considering it increased it from 1.5 to 2 GB I did not see a major improvement but positive. I would order again."
"Negative","The worst Bond ever: If Amazon hadn't forced me to, I would have given this film 0 stars! Big fat 0! This has got to be the worst Bond film ever. The only good thing about it is Christopher Lee as Francisco Scaramanga, one of the best Bond villains.But Herve Villechaize is fairly annoying as the midget henchman Knick Knack. Sheriff J.W. Pepper is back, and he isn't funny (it's best to remember him from LALD). That car stunt with the barrell roll was cool, but ruined by the worst sound effect in the movie. The action isn't good. James Bond doing Kung fu? The gadget master Q doesn't work his magic (r.i.p Desmond). The titles are bad, the title song is nauseating, and the girls are nothing but annoying.If you are a die hard fan get it, otherwise....BEWARE!"
"Negative","i can't stand the LYTE FUNKIE ONES!: i hate l.f.o.! they are so bad it makes me sick to see that they are making videos. they need to give up this career because they are terrible. they could not be worse wannabes if they tried.they are all terribly unattractive and i hate it when i see their videoes and those terrible bodies of theirs. their singings careers are gonna go down faster than the titanic and i await that day with anticipation. i am sorry to those of you who do not share my opinion, but trust me, you soon will. they are the spice girls of 1999 and no one will remember them in a month."
"Negative","Not recommended: I didn't like it. Not much happened and the funny parts weren't funny. Read something else."
"Positive","Makin' me hungry: These little groceries are really great representations of real food products. The plastic cans are shaped just like real food but scaled down for little hands. The labels have great graphics, but the best is the pre-sliced foods that hold together with velcro and then can be ""sliced"" with a big plastic (cannot really cut) knife."
"Negative","Why???: Why is this updated superior version out of print and only the earlier edition available?With new dvd prices above $200, this situation is intolerable, Image! At the very least, a blu-ray version is due, yes?"
"Positive","Awesome!: This game was my first foray into the Guitar Hero experience and I have thoroughly enjoyed it!"
"Negative","Missing Essay: Here is an excellent set of essays indeed. However, I was disappointed to find that one essay 'What I Believe' (about 30 pages) was left out of this publication. I bought the book because the pages are falling out of my much older copy (Allen & Unwin, 1967) and I was particularly interested in this essay. Although the book purports to be a full reprint of a valuable modern classic, there is no mention of the omission. Perhaps if I buy another book from this publisher (Routledge) I will find the essay. Other recent publications include the essay. Look around before you buy."
"Positive","The best book ever!!!: I thought and truly felt that Paula Danziger's, Can You Sue Your Parents for Malpractice? book was the best book ever. It was humorous and touching. I really enjoyed reading it!!!"
"Negative","The road...is paved with good intentions: Nice idea especially for inveterate tea drinker, but sieve-like strainer makes one feel at a prelude to tea leaf reading. Also, lid is meant as cover--not primarily a strainer cradle as pictured! We are definitely not in our cups."
"Negative","Seen it before: I guess they were capitalizing on John Glenn's sexagenerian ride into space with this good old boy tale of four early test pilots who ride the space shuttle in their 60s. Problem is this seems like it was made from spare parts left over from numerous other movies, from ""The Right Stuff"" to ""Lost in Space."" They all start the same way: in the desert with a test pilot crash from which the hero walks away unscathed. Clint Eastwood and Tommy Lee Jones carry the load here, while Donald Sutherland and James Garner have nothing to do, especially Garner. Eastwood delivers his trademark sneer here at the young whipper-snappers, instead of the bad guy criminals like usual. Totally inoffensive family entertainment, but probably only Grandpa will want to watch this."
"Negative","Terrible Quality: Amazon should not be selling this video. The quality is terrible. It appears to be home recordings of events that were recorded, primarily, from Japanese TV.It does not include spme of teh really great awards and presentations, like the 25th year of MTV, 25th year of Motown, etc. It is a waste of money and makes me feel totally different about Amazon."
"Negative","Electrolux EL12W Washable Filter: I requested an EL012W washable filter for the Electrolux Oxygen3 vacumm cleaner. So far, I've been sent the EL013W which doesn't fit the Oxygen3 and the EL012 which is not the washable version.My initial e-mail was promptly followed by the vendor sending me the EL012 (non-washable filter), but they have not responded to my latest e-mail telling them the order was still wrong now over a month later."
"Negative","Decent but not what I expected: I bought two of these expecting the long lasting, strong, stiff type. I knew they were beads but these things are barely stress balls. They can pass for them but i doubt if there will be any hand strengthing going on or whether they will work for real stress relief. They are rather soft, the beads arent pack in tight at all and they feel more like a beanie baby than a stress balls. I returned mine but I still give it 2 stars because they may work for others. More like boredom or pass the time balls but not stress balls."
"Negative","Not bad, but the worst of the series: I've read 11 or so of the Examples and Explanations books while in Law School. For the most part, the series is great. The material is broken down into sections that make sense and the important points are made and remade with the examples.This book is probably the worst of the series that I've read. There are numerous spelling/editing mistakes. The author tries (and fails) to be funny to the point of distraction. The material leaves out some of the important rules that you'll need for the test. The interaction between this section of the UCC and the Bankrupcty Code is barely even mentioned. And, the section of the book on ""Priority"" is not nearly as strong as it needs to be. For the first time, my text book was actually more helpful than the E&E; book.I suppose I'd still recommend it, but don't rely on this exclusively when you're studying for the exam. This might be the type of class where legal flash cards, etc. would be more helpful."
"Positive","Straightforward approach to Thai cuisine: This is one of the first Thai cookbooks I purchased. Since then I have purchased several others, but I keep coming back to this one as my starting point for creating an Asian menu. As most other reviewers have stated, the directions are clear and the ingredient list is manageable. Young offers some helpful tips along the way to make it easier.Some of the humor sprinkled throughout the book is an unexpected surprise. I love the spicy chili sauce recipe where the last step is ""call the fire department"".If I had one quibble with this book, it would be that more photographs of the completed recipes would be helpful. Even so it is not a major issue.All in all a good investment if you want to learn how to cook Thai food. And if you are like me, living in an area that is devoid of neighborhood Thai restaurants, it is a necessity for those of us who need our Thai ""fix"" on a regular basis."
"Negative","For beginers..: This book is for beginers... Any technician who worked few months on fiber optic knows about everything in that book. However, if someone never worked with fiber optic, this is a very good introduction... If the title was: ""... an introduction..."" I certainly rate this book 5 stars."

"Positive","a classic: J. Frank Dobie is the granddaddy of Western writers. His work ""The Longhorns"" is a classic. Long on lore, with plenty of red paint stirred in to keep it colorful, it's a great read."
"Negative","have not received this product: I have not received this product after over a month or ordering - please investigate. I do not know from whom this was ordered."
"Negative","Not user Friendly for 6 month old: I read the reviews and thought this would be the perfect gift for my 6 month old daughter at Christmas. I was very dissapointed in the amount of time it's on before it automatically turns off. To turn it on you press a star shaped button and it begins to do it's little song and dance. However if my daughter doesn't hit the drum in a time frame of about a minute it shuts off. She knows how to hit the drum and will crawl over to it and start hitting it to play but then gets disapointed when it doesn't make any noise. At 9 months, she still hasn't learned to press the button to make it start. She'd play with it more if her patting it started it up again."
"Positive","NO JARGON: The Pain of Helping: Psychological Injury of Helping Professionals (Series in Psychosocial Stress)THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THAT I HAVE READ IN RELATION TO THE AFFECTS ON THE HELPER.The history of trauma was interesting, and the different concepts i.e burnout secondary trauma etc was broken down into a easily readable form, the definitions contained in the back of the book were well defined and again very clear to understand i would recommend this book to anyone who would like to understand more about the affects of ""helping"" or to anyone who like me might be embarking on research that involves the phenomenons that the book covers."
"Negative","Definitely NOT David Sedaris: I picked up this book shortly after reading Dress Your Family In Corduroy & Denim (David Sedaris), partly because critics have described the humor/style akin to that of Sedaris (and I suppose the critical acclaim itself played some part in my decision). I should have followed my initial instincts and passed it by. The characters in this book are much too contrived to be real, the detail of events too keen. Had the author penned it as fiction, I might have enjoyed it more as I am a devoted fan of John Irving and human dysfunction in general. Yes, it is disturbing but not in any meaningful way - as others posting have noted - which makes it wholly gratuitous. I don't doubt that Augusten's young years were troubled but I don't buy this as a memoir and even if it were, I'm not interested."
"Positive","Hummingingbirds: This is one great book!I resentley had to do a report on hummingbirds. I looked in many books,but none of them seemed to have the information I needed to know.Then I found this book, it's full of great information on hummingbirds. I found out every thing I needed to know.( I got A+ on my report)You have to read this book!"
"Negative","This one is Very Bad: After listening to the CD many times, this long-time Westerberg/Replacements fan has reached a conclusion about it: It is horrible. The new material does not rock, and the songwriting is some of the weakest Westerberg has ever produced. In the past, Westerberg demonstrated that you could have great songwriting and still Rock. This time around we learn that Paul can also write some weak, mellow songs."
"Positive","BEST CONCERT WE EVER WATCHED: We have been to many concerts of top entertainers in person and have watched DVDs of them but have NEVER seen or heard anything so fantastic as this concert. Both my husband and I were breathless when it ended. In fact it was so fantastic I invited a group of ladies over a few nights later to watch it. I have purchased another DVD of it for our Daughter-In-Law's birthday and will be taking ours along to show additional family members when we visit them in a few weeks.I can not begin to tell you how wonderful it is, other then to say if you have not seen it you are really missing a special treat. This is not your usual concert. All those involved in the production of this really went over and above anything else. We will never get tired of watching it. In fact we might play it every New Years Eve."
"Positive","comprehensive text for math/science majors: This is a solid elementary text aimed at the stronger math/science majors or someone with enough mathematical maturity. It provides clear exposition, and numerous fun and challenging examples; the Monty Hall problem is especially well presented. The worked examples alone are worth the price of the book. They are that good.For non-math majors, this text is probably too tough-going but then Stirzacker has a gentler intro book ""Probability and Random Variables: A Beginner's Guide"" for this audience.This is an ideal text to prepare you for ""Probability and Random Processes"" by Grimmett and the current author. Grimmett also has an elementary text ""Probability: An Introduction (Oxford Science Publications)"" but is much more concise (more like condensed lecture notes, about 200 pages and less than half as thick as Stirzacker)."
"Negative","A mediocre resource at best: There is a need for a good, inexpensive book on RFP writing. Unfortunately, this is not it. No offense to the author, but this book is weak. The book assumes that all RFP's are about IT projects and doesn't even mention the possibility that an RFP might be issued for anything else. Materials? Contracting? Outsourcing? Never even mentioned. Do yourself a favor and try to find another book."
"Negative","Stinks So Bad . . .: I bought this thinking that the Cougar couldn't be as plastic as I remembered. He is."
"Positive","Oxfrod German Grammar review: This book is an enormous help for English speaking beginners learning German. While concise and logical, it explains the language from an English perspective. I have only had it a fortnight but it has demystified a lot of the problems I have enountered so far."
"Positive","Spiritually Deaf, this book gives me hope.: I have over 200 books on metaphysical, paranormal, biblical, gnostic, healing, channeling, etc. This book, Messages From Your Angels: What Your Angels Want You To Know by Doreen Virtue, is my all time favorite source of inspiration and guidance. Written exceptionally well for comprehension and offers great light into its messages. This book sits high above all the rest, simple, gentle loving information for all who seek that connection to the spirit world. Especially for anyone like me, a spiritually deaf child of God, finally, words I can hear and recognize as the light of truth."
"Positive","Fused Glass Handbook: Since I have received this book, I have read it and referred back to it several times. Most helpful."
"Negative","The secret is, STAY OUT OF THE WATCHTOWER ORGANIZATION!!: Although it contains some good tips for family unit, it is subtly written to draw one into their organization. Ironically, the WT organization's influence on the family unit over time has statistically been shown to be destrutive to that very unit (please research this). And yes, I have read the book in its entirety!"
"Positive","The best book on adopting from China ever published!: ""Nothing prepared me for the weight and expanse of the collected voices....The piece reads like gumdrops, each short enough for even a tired single parent to enjoy several in a sitting. I confess I had no idea of the impact of these voices, together for the first time, the sound of these parents finding extraordinary openings in their lives -- hearts cracked open with joy -- through which their individual voices ring so strikingly....The image reflected by the book is large. It's magnificently civilized. It's beautiful. It has permanently changed the way we think about ourselves."" --Rita Guastella, FCC/New England"
"Positive","A fun trip back to my childhood.: I loved ""Johnny Bravo"" when I was growing up, and the first season especially holds fun memories for me. So when I found out that it was on DVD, I just had to get it, and I'm happy I did. Warner did an amazing job with this set. A lot of DVD sets for cartoons these day are very bare boned, but this great set has a few really great extras, which just adds to the whole experience. The episodes themselves are just as fun as I remember. The animation, especially for the first few shows, is a bit dated, but when you know the full history of the character, it is easy to pass over that fact.Hopefully, WB will release the rest of this fine show. It is not for everyone, but Bravo fans will love it! I highly recommend this set to them and anyone who wants to enjoy a fun animated show."
"Positive","An ABSOLUTE must-read!: I can't say enough good things about this book. It is beautifully written and a complete inspiration. I feel fortunate to have the guidance presented in this book. It is fantastic."
"Positive","Well worth the convenient ending...and all the typos: Hamilton's ending to TNG may be unworthy of his own writing, but it's high art compared to most other SF writers. This is an author who succeeds at things most writers don't even attempt--and that scores major points in my book. If his next book is this good and has 50 blank pages instead of an ending, I'll still pay its hardcover price.While I didn't consider this in my rating, I have to add that this book has more typos than anything I've ever read. If this book were any other product, you'd call it ""broken"" and return it. Missing words, double words, and misspellings abound (and no I'm not talking about British spellings). In places you don't so much read this novel as decypher it. I'd blame sloppy proofreading if I thought it was proofread at all (or even spell checked by a computer). It's embarrassing to have such a fine novel defaced like this. And it's a ripoff to the readers to deliver a book in this condition."
"Negative","Not great: People I talk with sometimes could not hear what I am saying. I have to shout in order for them to hear me. I end up just taking it out and just speak using a handset."
"Negative","If negative stars were possible..........: Absolutely the worst piece of software I have ever owned... Caused constant system instability, and even the uninstall caused problems... and forget about support from mcafee, you're not going to get it.... save your money and allow all the hackers in the world in, because they are not going to be as damaging as this piece of software."
"Positive","scan disc: I would have thought that it would have come with some type of scan disc or larger internal memory! But all in all it is a very good buy!!!"
"Positive","Great multipurpose bra!: I love this bra as it is so versatile for wearing almost any outfit. It sticks well and even gives ""the girls"" a lift. I am 32 D so these usually do not work for me, but I keep buying these whenever they lose their stick. I have 4 friends who I also got to buy them and they love them too. The only thing I do not like is that when it's hot/humid outside these are not absorbent so sweat pools underneath your chest. Definitely learned my lesson not to wear this bra during the summer while wearing any grey or silky fabrics! Very embarassing, but overall a great product."
"Negative","Tambourine Sound: The tambourine was comfortable to hold, but the sound was very ""tinny"" and was not mellow. I ordered two because two of us would be playing it in a vocal mixed quartet and would be using a microphone. This tambourine would be too high pitched for our purposes."
"Negative","Not likeing the fustration!!!!!!!!: I have worked and worked and gone over and over all the hints, helps, and made cotact with all the characters and I am stuck in the Light House. The telephone call/hints tell me the Light House has some oil for the morse code light, but I have looked all over the Light House and can't find any oil. And the hits have become very vague. I can't find help anywhere. I advise everybody NOT TO BUY THIS GAME. It starts out O.K. but then it show some malfunctioning bugs. Perhaps that is why it is selling for $2.99. Too bad. I like Nancy Drew. For me her games are now suspect with bugs. I will not buy another Nancy Drew game. Too bad, so sad. O well, moving on..............Viviana"
"Negative","Terrrrrrrrrrrrible !!!!!!!!: I should have read all the reviews. I bought two and they won't charge - no light at all. I repeatly removed and then inserted the batteries in the charger and only one charged. I'm using the MS double charger. The one that was charged I will try to use. The one that won't charge I threw out.I really hope that MS did not sell these as a surplus to a distributor.YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR."
"Negative","Range problem?: I bought this product to work with a Logitech squeezebox. The squeezebox is connected to my stereo amplifier and plays .mp3 music files sent to it wirelessly by the Buffalo access point. The music frequently skips or stops completely. Rebuffering occurs frequently as the squeezebox is gathering data from the access point. During this period, the music will stop. The distance from access point to squeezebox is about 35 feet. This shouldn't be a range problem for a wireless device. Buffalo Techs have not solved the problem ."
"Negative","this book isnt true!: read the Feb. issue of Horse and Rider. most of the things in this book aren't true!"
"Positive","Absolutely Flawless!!!!: Let me tell you that this is Mary's best in a while. Of course nothing tops ""My Life"". Every track has a purpose and everything flows well. This one is definitely a keeper. Her shows are absolutely amazing, and if anyone gets the opportunity should check her out."
"Positive","Great 3D animation and great action: If u like a good story with great action and animation then this appleseed movie is definately worth checking out. This is definately a step above the last Appleseed movie,"
"Positive","bike: Love that this bike folds up. Very easy to put together. Everyone says the seat is uncomfortable but I don't mind it at all. I love this bike."
"Positive","Wait a minute....: First.. I totally love this movie. Have for quite a long time.. and have been waiting patiently for it to be released on DVD.... only to discover that upon the release date Feb 21, 2006.... that Amazon has it listed as 'usually ships in 4-6 WEEKS?'Is that a misprint?"
"Positive","great show just a comparison between ""new"" and ""old"" shredder.: ok first before i write about this show i want to compare the new and old shredder ok? first off:1.the old shredder was an idiot he was annoying.2.why didn't they kill him?3.he didn't have enough armor to me,he had stupid pieces!4.he didn't act intimidating.darn it if they could have done the new shredder in the old show i would have liked him as a supervillian oh brother he was a total moron back then he was like a grown-up 2-year-old!so that's all and i can't think of anymore problems with the old show at this time.but the episodes on this tape are great i don't care if we don't have boxed sets now i can just track down my favorites!!!"
"Negative","Faulty product ... customer Service a sham: BUYER BEWARE! This product has no follow up service. I have a faulty and defective brush head which has caused mold to grown inside the unit. I contacted customer service and they told me to send in the Model Number and they would replace the unit and brush heads. When I replied to their email I received a non-delivery status, FOUR TIMES! When contacting customer service via telephone they stated they couldn't replace anything because I didn't have proof of purchase. I suppose owning the unit isn't enough. Don't expect anything from Sonicare if you have a problem. Buy your toothbrush from another manufacturer. When I finally contacted another representative she told me the email is sent out by a person who has no control and just returns emails and says whatever it is they want to say. Caveat Emptor!!!"
"Positive","I liked it, though not as much as ""Speak"".: ""Fever 1793"" is about a fourteen-year-old girl named Mattie who lives in Philadelphia in, you guessed it, 1793. She and her mom and grandfather run a coffeehouse. Mattie starts out as a pretty ordinary girl, but then the yellow fever epidemic strikes and thousands become ill. Mattie gets sick, but survives. Her mother disappears. In running the coffeehouse by herself, and tending to the sick and dying, Mattie grows up in just a few months to become a right proper responsible young woman. I actually liked the beginning best. Mattie's voice was quite sardonic. ""By the time they had me tightened, pinned, and locked into my clothes, I could feel my stomach rubbing against my backbone."" The book was funny and sad at the same time. I hope Ms. Anderson continues to write novels as good as this!"
"Negative","Where's Dirty Diana?: HIStory would have been a necessary purchase if Micahael Jackson would have decided to with hold all of the new material, and just released the greatest hits. He also should have put Dirty Diana and Smooth Criminal on this cd. Dirty Diana was a #1 hit!! Michael could have put one or two new songs on this cd, Scream is good, You are not alone is decent, but the second disc is torture to listen to the whole way through. Buy Bad and Thriller."
"Negative","fanotr: Works but I don't expect it to last. Cheap plastic that I heard crack when I put the first on one. Good thing I only needed one and there were two in the package."
"Positive","LEAP FROG IS THE BEST LEARNING SYSTEM: I ALWAYS LOOK FOR LEAP FROG PRODUCT, SOME TOO EXPENSIVE BUT WHAT A MOTHER TO DO, NOT LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU AN DISCOUNT, SO I SAVE UNTIL I CAN AFFORD IT.THE BEST LEARNING SYSTEM, JUST BUY IT YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE WITH IT FROM BEGINNING TO END."
"Positive","Another of Dara's best: Dara Joy has a remarkable knack for taking the improbable and make it believable. I first fell in love with the charl knights and the shapeshifters in ""Rejar"". She has managed to tie up a lot of loose ends with ""Mine to take"". She has taken the shapechangers' abilities only hinted at before and expanded on them . In this she gave us a glimpse into a culture not even the charl knights knew the half of. Not to mention she has created another absolutely gorgeous hunk of a male character in Gian Ren. I must say Dara sure knows how to create them. Thank God she also creates them with unique personalities.They are really quite complex. The women are just as spectacular. The descriptions of these faraway places and the steamy occurrences in them are quite detailed but never crass. Get the book You will thank yourself later."
"Positive","perfect fit filter: This will help increase power for my HEMI. It was a perfect fit. Install only took 2 minutes."
"Positive","Ice Cube Trays ... made safer: Not a week has gone by since we purchased these that they have not been in constant use. Making our own baby food takes considerable effort, but these trays make storage a breeze. We use a baby food mill and freeze the ground-up food. Banana ""cubes"" can be put in a warm bowl of oatmeal ... and our 1-year-old loves it.There are a few minor issues we have enountered. As others have said, the lids do warp. Some of ours have, some have not. At times, the cubes can be difficult to remove immediately after removal from freezer; but all that is needed is quickly running the underside under warm water ... or waiting a few minutes before attempting to pop out the cubes.Overall, a great product...and we love that the trays are made out of safer materials than most other ice cube trays."
"Negative","Attention Non-wireless users: The keyboard and the mouse works with no problems, it deserves to get a good score.However, there are some personal issues that I have with it.For the keyboard, I feel that the tilt angle is not high enough as I've been using Microsoft keyboards all my life.For the mouse, I switched from a Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer to this one. I feel that the movement is not as accurate as my wired mouse. Also, the batteries add to the weight of the mouse which makes it tiring job to use the mouse. If you don't need to use the mouse or keyboard acrosss the room, I personally suggest sticking with a wired mouse."
"Negative","fizzle: received it a few days ago and it looked cheap. didn't try it out until tonight after i went to the store to buy more batteries (8AA, surprising). i tried it out and it worked for a few seconds then flickered and a little trail of smoke rose up from it. Doesn't seem to work now. That was disappointing and i was expecting a little more for the price. i'm guessing someone soldering the wiring had an off day and QC was probably lacking or non-existant."
"Positive","Outstanding!: This book is a great purchase for teachers of struggling readers and includes helpful strategies and techniques as well as lessons. It also has word lists which are a wonderful resource."
"Negative","many errors in there: Gallenkamp did a good job in bibliographic research, but please be careful when you read this book. Don't believe everything therein is true. I have noticed that there is a tremendous amount of inaccurate information included in text especially in accounts of Andrews' whaling trip to Japan (I am a native Japanese, so I know more about Japanese geography than him!) although most of the errors do not affect significantly the whole story of Andrews' life with a full of adventure."
"Positive","My Favorite Garwood: I love Julie Garwood's style and spirit in all her writings, but Prince Charming is by far my favorite. It is a slightly different style than her other books, which I think throws off some of her other readers, but in my opinion is refreshing. Unlike most romance novels, Prince Charming carries the story farther past the origional conflict. The initial ""throw ourselves at each other and onto the bed"" that usually concludes a romance novel is more to the side rather than the main focus. Instead there is an emphasis on the character's struggles to understand one another. Prince Charming is a beautifully told story, and I wholeheartedly recommend it."
"Positive","Much better than the movie: This book was pretty good. Definitely better than the movie, for those that are fans of the Star Wars franchise but didn't like the I-III movies. It gave me a better understanding of the start of Anakin's slide toward the dark side, and I understand the motivations and innerworkings of all the characters much better than I did prior to reading the Trilogy. Not as good as Revenge of the Sith, but better than Phantom Menace. Worth the read."
"Positive","Mandela (1987): Mandela(1987) as portrayed by Danny Glover is one of those classic movies/documentaries one would wantto keep in his library. It's been many years since i saw this film, and i must admit that despite mytender age of 13 when my family was owning this film, its memory is still intact.It's unfortunate that the film is not available in DVD today. But, even in VHS quality and availability, someantiques, the notable of this film never surrenders to the new ones.Danny Glover was extremely outstanding in his portrayal of Nelson Mandela's struggles for South Africa-tusslingwith the security apparatus of the Apartheid regime(the apparent machinery of the government), haggling in courts for his peoples' rights to vote, his seduction and woo of Winnie Madikizela, and his versatile disposition[s] in dealing with the day to day challengesof a 'segregated society' before he was sent to languish in jail."
"Positive","Couldn't put it down.: This is the first book I've ever read that I couldn't put down.I'm a model in the fashion industry and don't have time for ANYTHING! However, I cleared my schedule to read this book to the end. Why? Because, it put me in touch with my inner power, me! I feel alive again. Top models have souls too!"
"Positive","Great item: I bought for my brother in law 2 christmas ago. Its still in perfect condition and used daily. Would highly recommend."
"Positive","I like Significant Other better: I think that LB put out another good cd but it just wasn't as goood as Significant Other. LB lacks the really hard rock. The only songs that closely match up to Break Stuff and I'm Brock are Full Nelson and Rollin i am a little dissapointed but it still was a great cd."
"Negative","Not impressed: A lot of people recommended using gel pads. I tried them but there was no real relief from nipple soreness and the pads are very sticky, so you have to thourghly wash after you take them off. I wouldn't buy them again."
"Negative","not what I want my child to emulate.: interesting to read as an adult. Wouldn't want to read to a young child."
"Positive","Great Textbook for History courses: Lawrence provides a good general overview of midieval monasticism, it's foundations, it's institutions, it's role in the Church. I strongly reccomend this book as a text for midieval histroy courses, If you want to understand the culture of the middle-ages, you must understand the institution of monasticism, and this book will help you to do that."
"Negative","dont bother: of all the 1/144`s from wing,this is by far the absolute WORST!i had to waste half a bottle of glue on this thing.it needs far to much paint for a 1/144.im gonna bash this one,along with my other wing kits. spend your money on a good kit,like the hguc`s or at least an EW 1/144."
"Negative","Had to return it: Horrible smell even 2nd day. Does not heat well at all. My tiny $16 heater does better. Defective? I don't know but sure doesn't put out heat.The packing box was damaged almost ripped open.I will say it was very easy to assemble and is extremely lightweight with wheels. I am disappointed that so little heat came from it."
"Positive","Loooove it!: My daughter, one and a half, loves it. I find it one of the most entertaining children's programs around (for adults, that is), which is important when you have to watch the thing repeatedly. The stories are entertaining and teach good lessons. Sometimes my daughter will say ""dance"" and I'll put on the music videos for her. The songs are original and cute. I think my daughter has a crush on Max ;)!"
"Negative","One bound book, not a collection of books: Be aware that this is just one book with the three stories printed inside. It is not three separately bound books. Of course we love these stories, but I would have preferred three individually-bound books rather than this version."
"Positive","Love it!!: This was a Christmas present for my 4 year old daughter.The dancing princesses are adorable and I like that you can playsongs pressing any strings in any order. It's more durable thanI expected it to be. I'm the mom but I actually like playing with it too. This gift was a winner in my home."
"Positive","Easy to use: I like my stepper. It only need a little bit of assembly which took about 5 minutes. It counts steps and calories burned, and keeps track of time. It is small so I can hide it when needed."
"Positive","Bosch Icon best wiper: Just got them, easy to install. Extemely quiet and smooth. I will come back and post again after using them for a while but so far great improvement over old wipers."
"Positive","Great knife: This is a great knife and the usb drive is very easy to use. Great for transferring files. The light and pen come in very handy as well. Swiss army customer service is excellent in my experience."
"Negative","Really pathetic: I bought this at the airport news stand, needing something to occupy me for the 6 hour flight across country. Instead, after a couple hundred pages I could not bear to turn another page and chose to watch clouds pass by out the window. My gosh, the ""research"" that went into this book could have been done better with a couple of google searches. The ""character development"" is unbelievably poor, and the plot can be predicted from reading the book jacket.Yes, the book is anti-christian, which may attract some readers, but the fact that it is boring should dissuade anyone from bothering with this tripe. The amount of cliche plot devices is astounding. Save your money & your time."
"Negative","Dreadful sound transfer: The dvd image is great, the soundtrack transfer is horrible: drops in volume and the dialogue is often distorted."
"Negative","Barely Lasted a Year: You do get what you pay for, and these were wicked cheap. They seemed sturdy at first, then started to wobble within a few months. I added extra glue, which helped for while, but eventually even that gets loose, and now one of the chairs lost its leg and it is not repairable."
"Positive","Brilliant work...: If you are interested in deepening in Israel archaeology then this encyclopedia it is highly recommended, however there is a 5th volume with more up dates that you should probably get through the publishers..."
"Positive","Unusually Fun Book From a Master Sci-Fi Writer: Master science fiction writer Roger Zelazny, best known for his (Nine Princes of) Amber Series takes an unusual romp in this lighthearted farce.The month is October, and all the cliché Victorian and Romance era horror characters (eg: Dr Frankenstein, Jack the Ripper, Count Dracula, etc.) have come in the days before All Hallows Eve for a huge battle over the future of mankind...as narrated by Jack the Ripper's pet dog! Just spooky enough to be fun for Halloween; just light enough for adults and older children.This audio book version is a pleasant surprise: recorded in 1996 by the author himself shortly before his death, and for a long time thought lost, now restored. The audio quality is good, and the reading good, too, but this book really needs to be adapted into a radio play."
"Positive","seems to focus on the internet more than anything: This is a great book!!! It explains things much more in-depth than most books I have read about Java. The problem is the authors focus on the web publishing part of Java too much. So much that they just skip over some important things that one with an intermediate level of Java needs to know."
"Negative","SIB-100 Photo in a box: Upon opening the box and unpacking the lights I noticed parts missing (they had fallen off). The kit is a good idea but this one is quite cheap, the tripod is useless and will not support a DSLR - I tried and no luck as it would not lock. The components were undersized and cheaply made. The fabric is good, not great but good -- the box is difficult to keep square with the small velcro tabs. The lamps over heat in minutes and take quite a long time to cool down. Your better off looking elsewhere."
"Negative","Awful!!!: I bought this and one smaller size. Right from the start there were problems!!! Actually the pictures looked good-when it worked. Programming it is virtually impossible!! AGH!!! Never again will I buy a product from this company! NEVER!"
"Positive","A Classic!!: I discovered this book at a used booksale, and since I love stories about the west and Indians, I bought it. And once I started to read it, I couldn't put it down! I even thought of the characters during the day until I could get back to the book! I could even picture them-he was very handsome!! I also read Part 2 of the series, and just now I'm going to start reading the 3rd Part Red Bird! Even though parts are sad and made me almost cry, the happiness is there too, and the love of God! An excellent book in all regards!! I'm going to read everything she has written!"
"Positive","The Gap on a roll: The Gap Band started rolling on this Album.after this Album The Greatness of this Group really took off.""Humpin"" was the Jam here.but a Ballad took center Stage ""Yearnin for your Love"" took them to a whole different level.strong Funk Grooves&The Smooth Flow&Vibe of Charlie Wilson."
"Positive","Good but only a 6X max: This DVDs have problems when burned at speeds faster than 6X so, be patient and burn them at that speed, otherwise they fail most of time.I burn with K3b 1.0.5"
"Positive","as good: I was 14 year old boy in 1971, living in Lincoln, Nebraska, we would ride our bikes to the stadium and sneak in games by crawling under and over fences. That season has always held a special place in my youth and this book brings back all of the memories and gives a deeper insight into that game.Any fan of football will enjoy this wonderful book, even Sooners. It goes into history of the game and both programs and interviews members of both teams, giving a background of the game I never had.and of course the best part is that the Huskers still win.Now if only I can get a DVD of the game for Christmas..."
"Positive","trace: this mans music just gets better and still has a sexy voice for a countryboy. his music is all about the average persons life plus its just plain fun to listen too."
"Positive","Living Rock Genius Legend: I overlooked Berlin for a couple of years because I thought it was more of the same sounds. One day I got a hankerin for wanting to see a performance of ""Old Man"", a staple tune for me at age 16 in Rome, NY in 1973. When I bought Berlin, and opened the case, I got a real surprise. The surprise was that Neil also performed ""Like a Huricane,"" which was not listed on the outside of the case. Neil also did some Geffen Years stuff like Transformer Man very well. Now if we could just get some footage with Southern Man .....Oh yes, Old Man was awesomely performed by Neil as well.Mark in Tucson, 3-11-07"
"Positive","Best bag ever!!!!: This bag is the best one i have ever seen. It holds a ton of gear and it is water proof."
"Negative","TERRIBLe: This product was glitchy the moment I turned it on. I replaced the batteries multiple times trying to see if that would make a difference and it didnt. Withing 2 mins of using it the vibe completely died. Ive been having trouble finding a vibe that actually works and i thought that this would be the one. I am pretty upset with my purchase.."
"Positive","Love it: I love this workout. It is easy and simple to follow but you get a good work out. The ballet sculpt is a little hard but still provides a wonderful workout. This was the first dance workout dvd I tried out and I love it."
"Negative","Kodak Kamera Krap: This is the worst camera and photo printer I have ever bought. The camera eats batteries (gets about 10-12 pictures from new batteries) and the photo printer is very expensive to print a few photos. It is cheaper (and better photos) to have ""WalSMart"" to print off ones memory card from a camera. I believe I used this printer about possibly 15 photos before setting it to the side. Ink is expensive and not much of it. It is not worth the scrap price. THe camera is an Easyshare C875 and the printer dock is a Easy Share Printer Dock Series 3. Get anything else and you will be happier. This is equivalient to a throw-a-way camera. Mine has been idle for about a year and I think it would be a crime to donate it to a thrift store."
"Positive","Good sound quality: My sister recommended this headset to me and I'm glad she did. I immediately noticed improved sound over the headset I had been using. The headset is lightweight and comfortable."
"Negative","Dining Room Chairs: I waited a long time for the delivery of the chairs but luckily they came before Thanksgiving. To my dismay one of the chairs had to be returned because the legs were wobbly...the replacement chair took forever...now I am finding 9 months later that the two chairs out of six that we use the most are now also wobbly. They are beautiful chairs but I don't know how long they will last."
"Positive","This book has it all!: This guide was all I needed for my trip to Atlanta. It has great color fold-out maps, exact prices on all hotels and attractions, and even ratings for every hotel, restaurant, and attraction! I was able to take a tour of the CNN Center, explore the MLK Jr. Center, and even hang out at the zoo..I found it all in this guide..great for taking a trip with the family or for business."
"Positive","Reality Reading: I'm Not the New Me is about the author's struggle with weight loss & dating, but I think it is much more than that. Even if you cannot relate to the subject matter, this book is written for the average person. She talks like real people talk (there is a bit of swearing if you can get past that), she goes to work, hangs out with friends... I felt it was as if she was one of my friends telling me about her day. It is about much more than weight & dating, it is about those things in everybody's lives that they don't like about themselves & always want to change. I'm Not the New Me is an easy read, it keeps your attention, but it is not over dramatic. I finished it feeling like it's nice to know there are people like the author out there."
"Positive","An excellent book on customer retention!: Robert Mattison has done a great job by writing this book. If you are looking for a reference book that you could use as to how to retain your customers, this is the book you are looking for! As a CRM consultant in the telco area, I have no doubt that I will make very good use of the book in my next project! I recommend it to both consultants and also to all the telco marketing and customer service people."
"Positive","A biographical sketch worthy of its complex subject: An absorbing biography. This portrait of LearnedHand is as rich in detail and as dynamic inthought and scope as was the Judge himself.This book is written in style which isevocative and accessible. Gunther's review of thevarious legal doctrines is understandable withoutpandering. Woven throughout the book is a look ata very exposed human being. Here is a man withall the phobias and moroses of all men, yet a mindsecond to none.Tired of flat, one dimensional looks atindividuals you wouldn't care about had youmet them personally? Read this book. It willchallenge and ultimately inspire you that thereare books worth reading and people worthemulating."
"Negative","Who thought the yarn was a good idea?: This machine is good idea, but in reality it is not that well made. The wheel stops turning constantly. Since Christmas my granddaughter has only been able to work on it for 15 minutes. The eyelash yarn is awful. It tangles in the skein and in the machine. It is also almost impossible to bind the tube off of the machine with that yarn. When I bought it I could not see the eyelash yarn in the box, or I would have known to buy another yarn to go with it. The other thing that should have been listed on the box, is that it takes a lace weight or at the most a sock weight yarn. I am waiting to get some different yarn before my final decision, but I am disappointed in it."
"Negative","NOT TRUE TO SIZE: Way too small. tight fit. did not want a button fly. perhaps I messed it but didn't see anything about a button fly"
"Negative","Don't buy this book borrow it from the library: Reading is one of my hobbies so I won't say that I wasted my money for this hard copy but I will say that I see room for improvement. I was a little disappointed because the book was kind of confusing to me. The end left me hanging........ I will be starting your 2nd book this week and I hope and pray that your writing style has improved. Be Blessed Sharon!"
"Positive","good: We received everything in good shape and in a timely manner. I did like the quality of the same type of glasses better from other companies, but these work pretty good."
"Negative","Not worth my hard earned money: I'm not a formal critic, simply an avid reader. I have not even finished this book. After about 80 pages I gave up. The stories were disjointed, plots lacking (or so obtuse I couldn't figure out the point(s))and many simply lacked subject matter of interest to this reader. The title suggested an interesting read, yet many of the tales seemed laborious. I personally would not recommend this book to anyone that enjoys reading. Sadly, I consider the purchase a waste of my hard earned money. File 13 for this one."
"Negative","did someone forget to hire an editor?: on the surface, this book is very interesting. a village uses the fires from their salt cauldrons to lure passing boats onto the rocks. then they slaughter the crew and loot the ship. they need this in order to survive as the infrequent fishing seasons do not give the citizens substantial amounts of food. the follow through, however, is not that good. the story is not as engaging as it could be. also, in a few places the wrong tenses are used. that is not acceptable in any book, especially one with such a promising premise. some passages do succeed and that is why i give it three, albeit very reluctant, stars."
"Positive","cats meow!!!!!: bought this article last year. Let just say,I pull field arrows out of full size deer target(260 feet per second) with one hand and some good effort. Before I'd sometimes have to pull up deer target and set it on it's side and pull two-handed to get arrows out.This puller will elimanate all(ImeanALL) these promblems.Just be sure to put puller on in a tight fashion(use your head it's easy).I reccomend YOU buy two or more for your hunt buddies,they will surely appreciate it!!!!P.S.don't reccomend useing broad-heads in this type of target,da."
"Positive","title here: This book gave the nutritional foundation for rising health profile, even for diabetics. It is well-written and clear, with some humor to help anchor the new information in the mind. The resulting shift of eating habits has helped me drop 12% of my weight in three weeks. I did get my doctor's permission to alter my eating habits."
"Positive","Very Satisfied: My wife is very pleased with the product and I am very pleased with the service.. Thank You"
"Positive","A definite ""must have"" in your DVD collection!: My 5 year old daughter loves Sign-A-Lot. She likes to watch it first thing in the morning, after she wakes up and then she signs all day to me and my husband. She is constantly teaching us what she learned from Sign-A-Lot and we enjoy it as much as she does! It is so nice to see her learn so many signs and to see her teach them to her cousins and friends...is truly a joy! I highly recommend this DVD."
"Negative","eye candy and little else: The production seemed more like an exercise in computer graphics ""eye candy"" than a serious study of string theory and the controversy surrounding it. The skeptics were given short shrift and, as expected, Green and the rest of the M-theory high priests proselytized as best they could (you gotta have faith). Try Sparkchamber (www.sparkchamber.co.uk/archive/elegant1.html) or do a Google search for ""Multiverses and Blackberries"" by Martin Gardner of ""Scientific American"" fame."
"Positive","Beatiful!: At first,I thought this was a jade doll and it surprised me alot.when I got this,I renamed her Liv caus she looks like Liv Tiler!So ""Liv"" is a new adition to my bratz pack.The doll itself is durable execpt for the feet but the acceserees,OMG they are so easy to lose!I really love this toy and I think that any mother whom has a little or big girl that likes bratz this is a must have!"
"Negative","not like i remember: Maybe i had a different brand, but these were no way close to the ones i had in the 80's. The ones from the 1980's, were soft chewy, almost a gel, and tasted like real fruit. I use to by them at a bulk candy store that had other imported candies. Oh well."
"Negative","In Praise of Slowness:Challenging theCult of Speed: Living in Sweden, this book was given the highest standard of praise in my local newspaper. However, it was not what I had expected when I began to read it in English (my native language). Perhaps the translated version into Swedish was better than the original version. It was o.k., but not as good as the Swedish critic gave it honors for."
"Negative","ill keep my money thanks: Yeah I agree, I love LOTR but I refuse to shell out that many clams for something I will be replacing with something (probably even more clams to get) bigger and better. Stop messing around and release the extended editions thanks."
"Negative","Yuk!: Believe the other reviewers when they say ""Not Worth Your Time"" and ""Just A Bad Movie"". In general I'm a fan of Jean Reno, so I wanted to love this movie. But, it really IS awful. It's sort of a cross between ""Nash Bridges"" and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" Yuk!"
"Negative","A chink in the armor!: I received this case today and was looking forward to taking the worry out of dropping my HTC Titan. Everything looked good and fitted well. Then, while lovingly palming phone, I found that the ""Secure side closure design"" (so described) was anything but secure. It simply takes turning the phone over in your hand to disengage the latch. Very irritating!BoxWave HTC Titan Armor Case - The Metal Case, Heavy Duty Protective Case (Jet Black)"
"Negative","What a dissappointment!: I bought this potty based on the review of others. I purchased it for my son who will be turning three and was very hesitant about training on the normal toilet. This potty does have a larger seat, however, it's urine deflector is not tall enough and the urine leaks through the bottom. It is very easy to clean but I would recommend this potty for girls only."
"Negative","Virtually locked up my system: After installation, my system was virtually unusable. Since I had enabled the constant ""background"" defragmentation, I quickly configured it to run only in the middle of the night, and yet the system was still wildly unresponsive. Web use was massively slower. An uninstall took nearly a half hour to process, but immediately after uninstalling the system was again responsive as before. It also appears to have trashed one of my files in the process of defragmenting it."
"Negative","Absolute Junk: I give this book a ""2"" because I actually finished the book - I kept waiting for it to turn into the thriller everyone had been raving about. It was a page-turner alright - I kept reading because I couldn't believe that such a paint-by-numbers, ready-to-sell-to-Hollywood piece of junk was getting people so worked up! The characters, for a lack of a better word, were beyond bland. Baldacci's idea of characterization is to describe how ""beautiful"" a woman is or how devastatingly handsome the hero is. This book should have been titled ""Absolute Shallowness""."
"Negative","Lousy sound, uncomfortable earbuds, poor volume control...: I got these after buying the amazing Coby Superbass headphones (for less than $5). I wanted the volume control feature. Not badly enough, cause I ditched these after about 5 minutes. Less comfortable, mediocre sound quality and a volume control switch which is more like an on/off switch..."
"Positive","A Great read..we can learn some things from Jane Fonda: Well written...I was reminded of the story of the prodical son. The first step is the searching. May she find Christ."
"Positive","David Holmes Scores Again: This score simply carries on from the excellent work that he done on the Out of Sight S/T. The dialogue from the film is something that David Holmes use all the time, weather its for his BBC Evening Session Mix CD (amazing mix cd, its just got to be heard to be belived), his own albums or the above mentioned Out of Sight S/T. I feel the dialogue seperates this S/T cd from all the other run of the mill releases that lately we have had to suffer. The way the music moves thru the different years without you really noticing is a testament to his craft at scoring. He moves from the sixties & seventies up to the present day with his own tunes, but it all seems to go together. Just to finish I would recommend this to anyone with good taste, and for the first couple of people who reviewed this S/T, I have heard they are in the process of making Titanic II The Resurection, no dialogue at all, bet you can't wait for that S/T."
"Positive","A GENUINE BARGAIN: An Excellent product at an unusually low price. 500 Aspirin for only $6 with Free Shipping. I received the item on the third day after placing the order. It just doesn't get any better than this."
"Negative","Not what I had expected: I expected an actual notebook. Instead this was a small address book sized, no lined pad of paper. Good for jotting down a number or something, but not at all what i had expected. It was on clearence so not the worst $1.50 I ever spent. lol. pretty though."
"Negative","This book does not help with passing exam: I just took the exam after studying the entire book and I failed. The questions in the actual exam are ""case study"" style but the included sample test (on cd) looked nothing like it. The book is very general, contains reams of extraneous information and does not focus on the material on the test. I wish I could return it."
"Positive","INK CARTRIDGES: THEY WERE GENUINE EPSON INK CARTRIDGES AND WERE EXACTLY WHAT WAS ORDERED, ONE OF EACH OF THE THREE COLORS, MAGENTA, CYAN AND YELLOW. I DO WISH THAT THEY WOULD MAKE A BOX WITH THE BLACK INCLUDED."
"Negative","WARNING - False Advertisement: This is a horrible movie with no plot. Worse, there is no nudity. This product is not advertised as the next ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Citizen Cain"", but it is advertised as an ""R"" rated sex comedy. Further, when you press play, before the movie starts, a screen comes up that states that this movie was rated ""X"" by the BBC. What a bunch of crap. This movie could be shown on regular television. Fox could air this tripe at 1:00 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon and no one would bat an eyelash (not that anyone would actually keep the remote on this movie for very long). I really do not see how this movie could possibly appeal to anyone. The fact that Seduction Cinema actually transferred this to DVD and marketed it shows either an incredible lack of judgment or a conscious attempt to defraud its customers."
"Negative","Above-average fanfic: I couldn't help comparing the book unfavorably with Laurel Thatcher Ulrich's ""A Midwife's Tale,"" which juxtaposes the actual journal entries of a late-18th/early-19th-century midwife with the historian's exhaustively researched observations about what these entries tell us about that time and place.""These Is My Words,"" by contrast, is a better-than-average fanfic about Nancy Turner's ancestor. I say better-than-average because Turner did create characters I cared about -- so much so that I dreaded turning the pages for fear of the horrific fate that could befall any one of them at any moment. (The author's habit of relating events chronologically, rather than spilling the bad news right up front as a real diarist would have done, also bugged.) One tragic death, in particular, was set up in such a contrived way that I was rolling my eyes even as tears flowed out of them.On the other hand, everyone else in my book club found it enthralling."
"Negative","too much swing: I don't see why people are labeling these guys as a ska band. They are swing. I'm not a fan of swing but this CD is okay I guess"
"Positive","Best album of the year. Welsh Rock'n'Roll: All the songs are amazing - the best album since The Stone Roses. Kick %$#!!"
"Positive","So far, so good.: I took my daughter out for a ride on the WeeRide for the first time this past weekend. The first words out of her mouth were, ""I like this!""She's 2 years old and about 30 pounds and I was a little nervous as I'm not a great bike rider, but it went fine. To test the WeeRide out, first I put her in the seat, held the handles of the bike, and just walked up and down the street for a few minutes. Then I rode the bike with the WeeRide in place but without her, to make sure I felt comfortable. I realized that her seat got in the way of being able to get off my seat and straddle the bike (i.e., when stopping). I adjusted my bike seat to its lowest setting so that I could stand on my tiptoes while leaning forward from my seat. This isn't a good solution for long bike trips, as now I'm not getting a full leg extension, but it's fine for short trips around town, which is all I'm planning to do at this point.After two years off a bike, I am finally back on!"
"Positive","What a great little print server!!!: I no longer have to worry about having to connect my printer to a computer and sharing it on the network. The computer sharing the printer always seems to be off or stuck doing something in Windows.This device works just as advertised. It is small in size but gets the job done quickly. Setup is a snap and I now have a dedicated print server for my HP inkjet. Configuring the print server is easy and all the computers on the network found the printer fast. The entire thing took about 3-5 minutes to set-up."
"Positive","Perfect for charging your motorcycle: This is great for motorcycle batteries. If you are charging a car battery, I'd look for one of the more powerful battery tenders. This is great for any motorcycle, atv, jet ski, etc that sits outside, as the unit is waterproof. I have been using this charger for over 3 years and it has never failed me."
"Positive","Simply the best: This is, without a doubt, the best foil cutter ever!! I gave one as a gift last year and it's still sharp as ever so I gave two more as gifts this year..."
"Positive","Funny: I built the hype so I guess my friends did not find it funny at all. I, on the other hand, loved it! Watched it in theaters and bought it on blu-ray as soon as it was released."
"Positive","The Aquarium DVD Vol 1: This DVD is fantastic. Very calming to watch, and you don't have to clean the tank. Highly recommend it to lower your blood pressure."
"Positive","Must read!: This is the best thriller I've read in a long time. The suspense and the triumph over evil make it an exciting read, but the little dog grabbed my heart. I read it twice and cried both times when I read about him. You will fall in love with Seattle and rejoice with him when his life finally begins to come together. This one should become a best-seller."
"Positive","8 Man Rocks: Well this was a blind pick for me before I ordered it. Hadn't seen on it on the sci-fi ch/ like some of you, just read the synopsis and the story sounded really cool, like an anime version of Robocop or something.Well its way better than Robocop, though I thoroughly enjoyed that movie as a kid. I was very impressed w/ the look of the piece, most directors don't use the purple haze back/foreground, that was cool. If you like cop-animes you will love this! If you want monsters/vampires you will hate it. It's actually very realistic? The story is just as engaging as the action, and theres lots of action.You may also like Goku: Midnight Eye, Psychic Wars, Psycho Diver, Black Jack and BioHunter.Bottom line it was 100+mins and it felt like 30? I wanted it to be longer, or have another separate feature. Hope they make a sequel. The price is well worth it, very good deal."
"Positive","An Educational Tool for Many Professions: Finally, it seems we are able to take advantage of Karen Taylor's wealth of experience and expertise in the latest professional text. After hiring Karen to teach in the classroom, we as educators are pleased to see that some of the training conducted for professionals now has this valuable learning tool. Imagine the difference it can make to have the text available to accompany the hands-on instruction. The best of both worlds.I'm certain that the excellent presentation of material, coupled with the easy-to-follow information will keep the novice reader and professional artist involved from cover to cover. And it should hold a proud spot on everyone's shelf as a learning resource for years to come."
"Negative","OMG DONT !!!!!!!!!!!!: FIRST OFF I LOVE BROOKE HOGAN...BUT MY DAUGHTER IS IN LOVE WITH SHARK MOVIES SOO I WAS LIKE WE HAVE TO GET THIS FOR HER... SHE IS 5 AND EVEN SHE HATED IT .. I HAVE TO SAY THE BOOBS IN THIS MOVIE AND THE GRLS KISSING WAS A LIL TOO MUCH FOR MY KID BUT ALL IN ALL SHE LOVED THE SHARK BUT THAT WAS IT THE MOVIE IN SOME SCENES HAD CARTOONISH QUALITY. I LOVE THE FACT THAT BROOKE HOGAN LOOKS BORED THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE AND ALOT BITCHY..LOL.. IM GLAD SHE DIDNT DIE BUT PLEASE DONT LET YOUR KIDS WATCH THIS MOVIE OR EVEN YOURSELF... IT TOOK 2 HOURS OUT OF MY LIFE..."
"Positive","A great resource: In today's society, parents complain that teachers don't use enough resource material when attempting to instruct all students in the various multiple intelligences. Gone are the days when we can simply require students to copy vocabulary from the board, and gone are the days when parents would allow their students to attend a class conducted without a textbook. This book illustrates the vocabulary, gives in depth explanations for grammar topics and exposes the student to culture as well. It also provides an excellent opportunity for students to listen and react to native speakers via audio activities. This book is a also good source for extra practice. The clothing styles are hopelessly out of date, but that doesn't matter when the main goal is speaking and writing proficiently in the target language. Our school has been using this series for quite some time, and our students average a score of 4 on the AP exams."
"Positive","jd wagon: nice product son is two so we will see how durable it is. the wooden sides where not polyed or treated with anything where do they think this wagon will be used, inside? no outside going threw who knows what . but its cool"
"Positive","Once and Again -- Good to see you again!: It was nice to finally find the second season of this show. It went off the air way too soon! Nice to find a new copy of the dvd's!"
"Negative","Not that great: These are called ""Jelleez"" which, along with the fact that the label says ""soft rubber"" might lead you to believe, like I did, that these will be soft and fit comfortably in your ear. Don't believe it. If there is any soft rubber, then there's only a tiny layer of it over hard plastic. They're not really squishy or soft. These would not stay in your ears that well, unless you pushed them in and that's just not comfortable.And, as another reviewer mentions, the cord is rather short. The sound is Ok, about as good as I'd expect from $10 headphones.I paid $9.99, which isn't a lot, but when you can buySony MDR-J10 h.ear Headphones with Non-Slip Design (Black)that are super-comfortable, sound great and stay put - for about the same price - why bother with these?I expected better quality from Maxell."
"Negative","Not so great: The holes for the plastic parts did not line up properly and ended up taking much longer to put together than it should have because of it. I am also disappointed in the balance of the cart once my tools are in it."
"Negative","For Very Small Fuel Lines: Amazon needs to specify what size fuel lines this filter works with. I thought it was fairly universal, but it's for very small lines (1/4"" I think), and didn't work for me."
"Negative","UNSTABLE ITEM.: I found this item very small and very unstable to be used as exersize equipment.I returned it for a refund and sought another form of equipment.."
"Negative","A waste of time: I never read the books this was based on, I agree with everything said about the plot rambling on and on with no point. I was left wondering where Deborah went?! She was rescued alive and then you never see her again, her husband who was killed earlier also never reappears when all the other characters ""come back to life"" in the river world.I kept watching hoping something would pull it all together, but it never happened. The crazy ending makes me believe that it is destined to happen over and over for eternity."
"Negative","Catholic apologetic: The problem with this work is that it is an apologetic for tradition over Scripture as the Church's final authority. Kelly has done a tremendous service by quoting these Patristic Fathers, but he begins with his bias and does not deviate. I fear for his soul quite frankly. Any time you put any authority before God's Word, you are in very grave danger. If you are a Catholic, this is great. But if you are looking for the truth, look elsewhere."
"Negative","hardware problem: The ipod i bought had a hardware problem and it took me 2 months to get a replacement at my country. Mac Station Argentina had the model i needed but just for sale, not for replacements."
"Positive","Great gift and Size too!: Rizzo is of high quality and Size is larger then we had thought. This was a BDay gift for our younger child and he loves the doll and it is holding up to his use since xmas 09."
"Positive","Saw one for twice the price at the mall: I am very happy with this tall 4-panel shoji screen I purchased to help provide privacy for a house guest staying in my bonus room. I was at a local shopping mall yesterday and saw a 3-panel one of what appeared to be the same material for $79.99. I purchased mine for about $40 and then paid $19.95 shipping - and mine is 25% wider than the one at the store. It arrived in perfect condition and all of the hinges were fine, and so was the paper/cloth in the frame. I am a happy customer!"
"Negative","Not that great: Normally I like movies that star Leelee Sobieski, but the Glass House was disappointing. It was a very slow moving movie. The previews made the movie look very suspenceful, but when I watched the movie, I found myself waiting for the suspenceful parts that never happened. I would not recommend this movie unless you have nothing else to choose from."
"Negative","Very OLD recording: I did not know or pay attention to the fact that this is an old, old recording. This would be of interest to someone with historical interest, but not to me. I just wanted to explore some more of Hahn's beautiful sounds. Couldn't get to the sounds with all that old background. I gave the recording away, the first chance I had, to a pianist."
"Positive","Arthur enters the story line!: Jack Whyte does a superb job in this continuation of his version of the Arthur legend. This is the way Arthur really could have come to power. I've read this series (9 books in all) at least 5 times front to back and plan to read them again often at least once per year probably. I can't say enough good things about this author and this series!In this book Arthur enters the story (actually, he did that at the end of the previous book, The Saxon Shore in the closing pages). This series is just brilliant. The best and most credible retelling of the Arthur legend."
"Negative","MP3 Download Disabled!?: For some reason the MP3 download feature is disabled for this album. Not sure if it's Amazon's folly, or a request by the artist. What doesn't make sense is you can download his newest album from the same MP3 Store."
"Positive","~*~*~*~*~*~THE BESY BOOK I'V EVER READ!!!!!!!!!!!*~*~*~*~*~: I really loved this book and its sequal (the subtle knife)BUT I REALLY THINK ITS TIME FOR THE FINALL BOOK!!! THE END OF THE SUBTLE KNIFE WAS REALLY EXCITING AND FUN AT THE END BUT I REALLY WOULD LIKE SOMEONE TO TELL ME WHEN THE THIRD BOOK IS COMING OUT!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Positive","Captivating...I couldn't put it down. An excellent book!: You will not be sorry you bought this book. It is easy to read, yet packed full of information. It is written in a manner in which you will track easily, and understand. I want my children to read it! This is a must read for the christian who appreciates the salvation process of a sovereign God. What a remarkable life Mr. Newton had. Though he suffered greatly, he continually gave all glory to his Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. I consider myself blessed to have read this mans life story."
"Negative","Piece of Junk: Literary? Indeed. You would get better advice of how to raise young from an animal. You can't even call these jokers authors. They are idiots."
"Positive","Twelfth Night hits the mark: This film was an excellent adaptation of the Shakespeare tale. Having read and performed the play myself, I enjoyed seeing it in the 1890 period. Overall excellent, and suggested highly."
"Positive","Chill out: I'm not a big English-writing-jargon-blahblahblah kind of guy, so statements like, ""the over characterization of the mid-plot, doesn't even fit in with his standard style of the Victorian age."" Whatever. I'm here to say that if you are looking for a fun book that is quick to read, buy this book. I liked it a lot. It made me smile. And I hate smiling."
"Negative","Good sound, if it works.: Got the radio sounds good! After 3 days or so Radio kept freezing, locked up. I would have to unplug the unit to reset. When the radio froze the remote or the knobs on the radio had no function. Then the LCD screen went blank. Returned the radio to J&R.; Had to buy another unit to get the original shipping box to return first radio. Still waiting for my credit. Second radio came. Radio will freeze after playing for 6 hours. Unit gets pretty warm. Is it overheating? It's just a radio! I think I am too embarrassed to return this one.Buyer beware. I can live with this as long as it doesn't get worse."
"Positive","I can't get this song out of my head!: I first heard this song at a dance club in Spain, then came home and was ecstatic to hear it a few days later on the radio. This is a great dance song and I can't wait to add it to my very selective music library."
"Positive","See Conquest's last name: Me am good member of party. Me no like book. It say bad to starve 8 million people to death. Socialism above bourgeouise idea of morality. We liquidate who ever we want and Liberal useful idiots always defend. Besides kulaks bring it on themselves. If only they gave us all of their food in 1930 then we not take it from them in 1931 then no famine in 1932! famine be in 1930 then. This am important.Also talking about famine really fasthist plot. Anyone who not like communism fasthist and anti-semite. Cell leader tell me this last week so I repeat it here. Stop talking about famine! Vast right-wing conspiracy. Bush is hitler. Stalin great builder of mankind. Lenin god. Marx bigger god. Only bad stupid people not like. Me am not stupid.Conquest am bad. He write for Thatcher!! Look at his last name. Conquest!! Me write Putin now. When communism come back, we remember. Party never forget."
"Negative","You want real special operations?: Clancy doesn't cut it with this overblown, politically motivated book. Check out Andy McNabb's, Bob Mayer's or even Dick Marcinko's books. Or James Webb's classics."
"Positive","Christmas Stories: These 2 tapes are excellent. I was preparing to give an Advent retreat at my church, and I had seen Fr. Shea on retreat a few times, but I was not prepared for the treat that these two tapes gave me. I listened to them every day during Advent, and these enriched my entire Christmas season. Fr. Shea's wonderful spirit of humor and deep love of the Lord really come through on these tapes. He is one of the best storytellers anywhere. You'll love these tapes!"
"Positive","Pick Up This Garbage!: Garbage is the preeminent modern rock band, far surpassing the Cranberries and Hole for this title. Their new CD, ""beautifulgarbage"" is a testament to this talent.From start to finish, their 3rd outing will delight - and surprise! - you. Of particular note are ""Shut Your Mouth"", ""Androgyny"", ""Silence Is Golden"", ""Cherry Lips"", ""Untouchable"", and my personal favorite, ""Cup of Coffee"". This is the BEST song on the CD, a slow, haunting tale of blind love, rejection, obsession, and despair. The raw emotion Manson brings out on this track is extraordinary. You're sure to enjoy every minute of this track and this CD."
"Positive","An Observation: Just had to add (after reading these reviews)..This book seems to have struck a chord with some, hit a nerve with others!"
"Negative","Did I miss Something???: Did I miss something? I used to read JG for the romance, the sweetness and the chemistry between her characters. I like mystery novels too, but JG just doesn't ""have it"". I miss her historicals and the way Heartbreaker and Mercy were written. Please go back to those! Also, please put us out of our misery and right Noah Clayborne's story...then go back to historicals."
"Negative","No good in frigid climate! ! !: I bought two of these frames for my daughters new car, and they really looked great. The problem is, we live in Minneapolis and the chrome plating on these frames is not the highest quality. After one winter,the frames were coroded badly and we had to replace them. My advice to anyone considering license plate frames is to go with stainless steel, expecially if you live in a frigid climate. One other problem we had is that she got a ticket for having a ""cover"" over the license plate. Minnesota has a law that does not allow you to cover the license plate, even with clear glass or plastic so, I would recomend that you check with your local police and make sure it's legal to use these frames in your jurisdiction."
"Positive","Entertaining: I'd like the premise, and the heroine Jane Nichols. Although not the best thriller I've read, it kept my interest.I am definitely going to read the sequel!"
"Positive","RARE and cancelled...: YOU are lucky if you find it beacause it was release and a few time after cancelled... so a FEW of them were sold ! And B-sides on it are ...WOW! ""Never Be Free"" is one of my favorite B-side !! this is even better than ""enough is never enough"" and ""girl don't come""!MAB"
"Negative","Turntable: I purchased this item in October, and have yet to be successful in getting it to work with my Mac G4. The problem may well be with the Audacity software that came with it. The turntable itself, while large, is eye-appealing, lightweight and compact in design. The belt-driven turntable works well, the arm is, while slightly problematic in setting up, functional, and the controls accessible and easy to use. Unfortunately, the most important element is to get the thing to function with my computer, and so far that hasn't happened. Too Bad!"
"Positive","Clarity in a bag, for an urban Navajo who misses home---: Unspeakable comfort, during good times and bad. Wise like my Grandmother. Many Thanks, R.Begay"
"Negative","MAYBE IT'S TIME TO QUIT: I have read every single Cat Who book and, in fact, own them all. Some are better than others, but none even come close to being the ""turkey"" this one is. Where was the author's editor? Asleep at the wheel? Where was the publisher's input? Obviously non existant. If this author didn't have so many books to her name, this one would never have made it into print. I wanted to give it a zero, but one star was the lowest allowed. I suggest you save your money--and a trip to the library. The book is badly written, has no plot, wanders from one subject to another, and is so boring I had a hard time even getting myself to finish reading it. The only reason I did finish is because I kept telling myself that maybe it would get better. It didn't."
"Positive","Survival: This is a story of suvival. Survival of the mind, body and soul. You can take this trip with Jack and see everything he sees and feel everything he feels as the narration is so well done. I can hardly wait for the next book."
"Negative","A puffed-up mess whose original message is lost in an intellectual misfire: SPOILERS FOLLOWI need to be a dissenting voice and say that this movie is not as good as it wants its audience to believe it is. The only things that recommend it are an admittedly grandiose portrayal of Fagin by Ron Moody that justly rivals Alec Guinness in the overall better ""Oliver Twist,"" and a couple of songs that rise above the mediocrity of their counterparts. ""Food, Glorious Food"" and ""Consider Yourself"" are not reason enough to make the rest of the musical. Performances are shoddy and unremarkable. Bill Sikes is a dandy bore in this production and not the monster Dickens wrote him to be. Worst of all, Dickens' message of nobility amidst poverty is completely lost in the desire to mutate the story into a happy-go-lucky song-and-dance. Stay away at all costs."
"Positive","Learned a lot about my body: I appreciated the educational aspect of this book a lot. I learned a lot about the parts of my body (always wondered what the difference between a ligament and a tendon was). Also the chapter on the different classes of pain-killers was useful and I understand more fully how they work, possible side affects, and know now which one to choose. As for the program of stretching, I think it is great. My only wish for the book was for some info on obesity and how to work the exercises when you're just too heavy to do them correctly. I fudged and used some of the alternatives for ""seniors"" that worked, though. All and all, a very helpful book and I look forward to regaining my flexibility and reducing pain as I work the program."
"Negative","Mixed Results: The camera works well when connected via Ethernet cable but falls short when used as a Wireless camera. The problem is very evident when one applies WEP security. Performance falls to unusable with frequent disconnects. Too bad as the camera does fairly well otherwise."
"Negative","Incompatibility of DMS1 with Rhapsody v 3: I was advised by Omnifi Support that the Media Player may not work well with the new Rhapsody version 3 software. That's definitely a major drawback."
"Negative","Not your mother's percolator: I purchased the 12 cup percolator and have enjoyed using it every day for the last year and a half; however, last night as I was cleaning it- I noticed a hole in the black bottom area just below where the stainless meets; obviously it was overheating and melted an area of the plastic. My mother used a previous Farberware for over 10 years with no trouble. I am past the 1yr warranty so I am now in the market for one that will last me a few years! The quality just isn't there any more."
"Negative","A good tribute but....: If you have not heard the originals, then buy them first. If you want to explore then try the album ""Comes in Colors"""
"Negative","poor accuracy: This BP Monitor was accurate for about the first 2 weeks of use. BP from monitor checked closely with manual BP. After the first 2 weeks, got very inaccurate results dispite replacing the batteries. I can not rely on this monitor for my patient's B/P results."
"Positive","Paris Hilton Song: I really really enjoyed the movie. I wasn't expecting an oscar winning movie, unlike you haters out there, but I was entertained and thats what matters. For the future readers who are dying to know the name of the song that Paris Hilto strips to, its called AUTOMATIC by Brothers Conti. They're this new duo so it might be kind of hard to find their stuff, their album hasn't even come out yet, but that same song is on mcdonalds commercial. Hopefuly this helps!"
"Positive","Good quality for the price: I was very impressed with the quality of this screwdriver set for the price. I do a lot of tech work on airsoft rifles so having these at my fingertips has made my life that little bit easier. The only gripe I ever had with them is that they were a little hard to torque on the tougher screws, but then I noticed the little hole in them you can slide an allen key through and get all the torque you could need for such a small little driver."
"Negative","rice cooker: Received cooker with broken lid clamp. Contacted seller who asked for pictures of cartons and broken part. Since I had already trashed the cartons and cooker, this was not possible. They did offer to said a replacement free of charge would I have been able to accomplish their request. It was really what I was looking for, alas it was not in perfect condition. The cartons were in perfect condition. One exterior carton and the cooker in display carton was packed inside this. The broken part was just laying in the bottom of the display carton as I slid the cooker out."
"Negative","Horrible: This product seemed like a good idea but once I got it i realized it was way too big for the levels of my cage, the zippers never stayed, they always fell down, and the clips were hard to manage. When I finally situated it in my chinchillas' cage they never used, they some how managed to flatten it and chew it, when i tried to fix it i realized they ate the thread that held the zippers in place and the tiny black peices were all over the cage, somewhat of a hazard. waste of money, i threw it out, i should have returned it right away..."
"Negative","I never thought Meryl Streep could give a ""bad"" performance.: I never thought that Maryl Streep could give a bad performance. It is difficult to believe this is the same actress from Sopjie's Choice and The French Lt.'s Woman. Oh, well, I guess one stinker in an otherwise glorious career is to be forgiven. Don't watch unless you are a ""movie masochist."""
"Negative","A Waste of Wood Pulp: This book is another example of ""scholars"" cashing in on popular culture. The back of the book calls the authors ""all well-respected scholars,"" yet many of them are graduate students who have never published before! The book is also full of obivous factual errors that any serious student of the X-Files will recognize immediately. As an X-Files fan and an academic, I am both disappointed and offended by the poor quality of this book. The one part of the book worth reading is the intriguing Lacanian analysis in the last article, but that alone does not begin to justify the publication of the book. The X-Files deserves a serious scholarly examination--this is not it"
"Positive","Fantastic Episode: This episode was the show's first dive into alternate realities and they did a good job of it. From the plot, we can ascertain that if Daniel Jackson would have said no to Catheryn from our reality, things could have gotten this bad for us too.The last scene leaves you with a good, but bad feeling. The destroyer of worlds is coming, so-to-speak.There is one continuity error. When the alternates try to dial the Beta site, they say that chevron 2 is ""encoded,"" however, the symbol shown is Earth's, which is the 'point of origin' and should be the last, 7th, symbol, not the 2nd."
"Negative","Rolled The Dice And Took My Chances: Before buying an Extigy I read the reviews on this and other sites. The consensus was that people either love this device or hate it. Hoping that I would be one of the lucky ones, I boughtone from CompUSA. Following the installation my screen turned a hazy green - like looking at the monitor through an old Coke bottle. As I tried to open applications like the Creative Recorder, I found that the files I had loaded from the CD were corrupt. There were no downloads to fix any of the problems I encounted. I exchanged it at CompUSA for another one. I got the same green screeen on both my IMB and Dell laptops. The second installation CD had many of the same corrupt files.It's going back this afternoon and I'll start looking for a different product.Good luck if you buy one of these - and keep your receipts!"
"Negative","All hype: This is one of the most overrated ""horror"" films you'll ever see. I, too, was swayed to check it out after hearing about its ""legendary"" status as one of the greatest ever made. It's just not true. It's unintentionally hilarious in many scenes. About the only positive comments I can offer are for the effective use of extreme color and an interesting soundtrack. Otherwise - a waste of time. Watch ""Dead Alive"", instead."
"Positive","A Must Buy!: First, these outstanding songs were performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, one of the BEST orchestra in the world!The LSO has a great reputation for playing Rock & Pop music, and they done it again with this album. I really love some tracks, like Night in White Satin, House of Rising Sun, Bohemian Rhapsody, Another Brick in the Wall and Layla. The atmosphere was grand, and that helped unleashed the spirit of the songs."
"Positive","Little Britain is Fab!!!: Matt and David are brilliant. The live show just proves it. I loved seeing the adlibs and bloopers and especially the segment on David swimming the Channel.On a side, Paul Putner was fabulous in all of the little roles he played. His costume changes were infinitely more complex and faster than some of the others.For British comedy lovers, this is a must own!!!"
"Positive","Well done: You will have to work but this book will help, especially if you know a little but about Spanish. Exercises, verbs, vocabulary. It is worthed. Enjoy it."
"Positive","My Two Babies Love it!: The playpen is very attractive plus the white color makes it look so clean and dainty. It's the perfect size for my two babies, chihuahua and pomeranian.They can even play inside it, and doesn't take up a lot of room. My two dogs love it! It's a great buy for your babies to enjoy."
"Positive","Sappy over-synthed, but overall very good: The whole disc, especially the three hits and 'Santa Monica,' are great, and the rest, while just one step above filler, have heartfelt, intelligent lyrics, and the backup music is really cool"
"Positive","A revisiting, a progression, a refinement: While returning to more rock roots on this particular outing, this version of ASIA have somewhat rekindled some of the feel and sounds of old while refining their particular craft or formula in the process. The current lineup of Downes, Payne, Govan, Slade have a tight confident feel and a sense of good kinsmenship which holds a band together rather than pull one apart as in previous incarnations. This is reflected in the music and the effort pays off. Crystal clear production is also an added bonus. While I won't go into details as to my personal favorites, it is clear to me that you must listen to this cd several times before forming any opinions of likes or dislikes. It did not gel with me at first and took about 3 listens to finally process what I was hearing. A solid effort."
"Positive","original Rocky Horror music CD: What's not to love? Excellent clarity of sound, with the sound being Tim Curry and Company! Memories are made of this!"
"Negative","Baaaad: Dont bother with this one or any others from these guys.Crap music sound track over the top and the camera work is appaling.As soon as something is looking good the guy seems to want to annoy the viewer by moving away or just movig arround so fast you can not see anything.Save your money and get one of the ""gone wild"" dvds. Much better and hotter content."
"Negative","Depressing & Super Boring, repetitive: Not worth the money. See the few negative reviews below and you will understand what I mean. I am still wondering why many people enjoyed it. I PROPOSE YOU TO READ THE COMMENTS BY OTHER READERS BEFORE DECIDING TO BUY/READ THIS BOOK. I will recycle MINE as I wouldn't like to see it sitting on the shelf."
"Positive","Oustanding: I love this video. It is so inspirational. I cried and cheered at the end. I've tried the juicing and words cannot express my gratitude for sharing your experiences. I will be an avid juicer for life!!"
"Negative","Junk: The belts shread because the front screw that holds the ""self tracker"" comes loose. At least that's what happened to mine and I bet it's what's happening to everyone else. You wouldn't notice it unless you looked inside the side of the sander. It will still sand like this but as everyone else experienced, it will eat your 10 dollar belts very quickly. I bought mine from a big box store but it's junk and I'd recommend spending 100 bucks on a better model as the 50 dollar sanders will only cost you time and money when they break in the middle of a project. Skil will ""repair"" it for shipping paid both ways, which happens to be half the cost of the tool. Anyone who doesn't have an issue with this tool hasn't used it long enough."
"Negative","Didn't work in my Benz: Didn't work in my Benz, tried everything to trouble shoot and in the end... it had to be this part of the puzzle."
"Positive","pyramid PR2500 pre amp: Can,t be beat for the price! Paired it up with a pyle #1000 power amp and radio shack 30 band equlizer. Sounds awsome!! Between the price and the free shipping I,m one happy Dude!!!"
"Positive","As Good As It Gets: You won't find classic West African music better than this collection. Such hits from the late 60s to mid 70s as ""Absa Gueye"" and ""Jalo"" set the pace for the modern sound of Senegal even today. I've had the privilege of seeing them perform live many years ago. And waching Assane Thiam, the drummer on ""Absa Gueye"" (and probably most of the band's recordings), is astounding. The narrow tight drums that make the rippling sound are played with the fingers of one hand moving so fast you literally can't see them. It should be on video."
"Positive","Good Movie: Bought this film as a gift for the family, they watched on Christmas Eve and loved it. Great buy, memorable movie for all ages!"
"Positive","Product worked well: We ordered this for age drying beef and it worked quite well for that purpose. It is cheesecloth so there really isn't more to add!"
"Negative","I pretty much hate this book: This book has a terrible layout. Some of the clothes are nice, but they are shown on wire forms which make them look awful. Not an eye pleaser at all, but it serves as an ok reference."
"Negative","Battery Latch Broken - HP Lost Computer - Claims No Responsibility: Amazon is a great company and have many great buys on line here, however HP Buyer's please be wary. If you never have a problem with your computer, you will likely be happy. However if you send it in for service, you may be in big trouble. I sent mine in for a broken battery latch. This, by the way, was extremely weak for the task of holding the battery in the housing. However, the worst part is that I shipped it to HP under warranty. HP service is now claiming that they shipped it back to me, however they can not give me a valid tracking number. They say I should take my troubles to Fed/Ex. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am out the cost of the computer as far as I can tell and HP is claiming no responsibility. HP LOST the computer."
"Negative","this game was better when it was called baldur's gate: dark alliance: ok so i knew it was like baldur's gate, but unfortunately it's worse! it gives you too many options to deal with items, customizations and whatnot, and not enough fun action. i was really hoping a big problem with baldur's gate (aiming arrows) would be fixed, but nope! it wasn't. in fact, the problem was worse. screw this game."
"Positive","Canon DR 2580C: This is the second Canon scanner we have purchased. The compact size and sheet feeding is very convenient for scanning multiple documents at a work station. The only drawback is a few misfeeds likely due to having to pull documents into the scanner from the desktip rather than vertically. However this infrequent problem does not effect our overall satisfaction with this scanner."
"Negative","Breathy Mariah: Mariah's quest to come up with an album that matches her earlier successes is sadly not matched by her vocal quality. Gone are the days when she sandblasts her song with her 5 octave voice and it is now replaced by breathy, trying to sound sultry vocals. There are just too many cracks in her vocals that even computer splicing and dicing won't work. She needs a voice lift."
"Negative","Tropical Sprite on Creatin: I purchased the tropical punch flavor and it immediately made my stomach churn. It felt like ""bubbly acid"" tearing up my stomach. Did anybody else feel the same way when they first took this product? I also take the cell tech whey and I love that."
"Positive","Great little pliers: Great little pliers by the company that specializes in this style. No complaints. Very small, but useful."
"Positive","Sewing book: Fun books to use for teaching young students to sew. A bit redundant on some lessons, but it is a teachers job to use what is needed according to the students learning levels. We did have fun with it though."
"Positive","better than reviews: Better than the bad right ups and comparisons made to old movie. Action is good, graphics are good. I would rent it again."
"Negative","Product sent is not product advertised: The item advertised is vegetarian capsules. The item that was sent to me was caplets which are solid tablets and are not vegetarian. I was told that this is not sent by Amazon, and therefore, they are not responsible for it. I looked on the Internet to see if I could find the vegetarian capsules elsewhere, and it appears that the company no longer offers them. Yet, Amazon continues to sell a product which doesn not exist. I returned the product for a refund."
"Negative","Sounds good but don't wander too far away: I was really disapointed with this product. I did like the sound and the size and the way it fit behind the ear. What I didn't like is the range. Plantronics claims 300' but when you talk to their tech support, it's 300' in an open field. They told me that through walls and the like the range is more like 150'. That would satisfy me, but I could only get about 30' away and I would get the out of range beeps. Tech support said that the headset was defctive and to exchange it. I must give credit to Amazon, they have excellent service. I received the replacement in just a couple of days. Sorry to say, I had the same problem. I had to return it also. I am comparing this headset with my old GN Netcom GN9120. With the Netcom headset I was able to get a 160' range."
"Positive","Funny - basic burlesque humor: Nothing more than a running gag over a boys desire to be a man and the system. Extremely funny!"
"Positive","Works great: I like this sink strainer.. It works great for peeling potatoes & catching all the peels. It also will last a long time & is better then a plastic one that I used to have.."
"Negative","Palpatine himself runs Sony Online Entertainment!: Imagine this........A game that......every 6 months a new ""upgrade"" comes out that renders all your previous hard work, loot, weapons, etc worthless.Non existent customer support.......if you complain on the SWG forums they delete your post or they ban your account.Sound like fun?........"
"Positive","Sharon Tate remembered: I read Greg King's book,"" Sharon Tate and the Manson Murders"", and as someone who has read Vincent Bugliosi's ""Helter Skelter"" as well as ""Manson:In His Own Words"", I was very impressed by this book. I found out many things about Sharon, the victims of these crimes, and the Manson Family that I had never known. But the one thing that really impressed me was that the book focused on Sharon herself, and less on Manson and his followers. Those people should never be allowed to profit from their crimes. This book puts the spotlight on Sharon- the way it should've been all along. I came to the conclusion that she was a beautiful, caring, person that did feel much emotional pain because of the demeaning way her husband ,Roman Polanski, treated her. It's sad how she and the other victims were pushed to the side in favor of Manson and his ""family"".Finally , after so many years,Greg King's book changed that."
"Positive","Hey, it's still George Jones: This modestly-programmed collection is a good overview of his final work for the MCA label from 1991-98. The disc opens with Jones struggling to feign interest in the rock-oriented ""young country"" sound; the problem was with the formula, not with his singing, which remains great to this day. There are some notable songs, such as ""Wrong Is What I Do Best,"" but where things really started to click is on ""High-Tech Redneck"" and ""Walls Can Fall,"" songs that marked the start of a commercial and creative renaissance that finally got George engaged on an emotional level again. This may be about as much of his music from the period as most folks would need, although diehard fans will also want to track down the original albums."
"Positive","EASIER TO read, not to guess who.: EASIER TO KILL, was another feather in the cap for Ms. Wesley. Mandy Magic, the subject of the stories, had more secrets than Samsonite had luggage. How she thought that none would show the light of day proved what a egotistical subject she would be. When her veneer did finally crack, it was Tamara to the rescue! I enjoyed every bit of the book, and have even started to pick out who is the killer was. However, all my choices were killed instead, and the true killer was someone I almost forgot was in the story! I'm now ready for THE DEVIL RIDING. Keep up the good work."
"Negative","Don't go there: No brass on it anymore. Just a wood plank for $72 and cheap plastic knobs -- which arrived broken in transit. Shame -- it looks like it was originally a nice office piece."
"Positive","peaceful and relaxing music~mainly instrumental: I bought this years ago and misplaced this CD. I love this CD! I would buy it over and over again and give it as a gift. It has helped me to relax when I have had migraines or simply didn't feel well. I would simply play the music and rest in a quiet and cool room and my headache would fade away. It just has so many wonderful, instrumental songs in it! I highly recommend it! I could sell many of these CDs to others, because I simply love this CD! I'm thankful that they have more that you can order."
"Negative","May this book rot in the jungles of Yavin...: Words cannot describe what a let-down this whole series is. I can't wait until the whole plot line (if you can call it a plot) fades from my memory, because right now it is putting a big damper on the magic of the Star Wars universe. The characters were ridiculous. KJA failed miserably at portraying George Lucas' AND Timothy Zahn's characters. Plus, the new characters that Anderson creates are so silly that I felt like I was reading a Mad magazine instead of a Star Wars novel. And Mr. Anderson PLEASE!!!!! STOP WITH THE SUPERWEAPONS!!!!Overall, the book was unimaginative, cliched, dreary and predictable. I'm not saying that KJA is a bad author. I have never read any of his other novels so I don't know what they are like. What I am saying is that KJA does NOT do justice to the Star Wars universe. If you're looking for an author that DOES get it right, try out anything by Timothy Zahn.If I could give it less than 1 star, I would."
"Positive","Good book but long: The Swarm is a good book. The story was very interesting: intelligent sea creatures destroying the human race. The problem is the book is way too long. I skipped alot of explainations and boring stories about the characters. If the book was about 300 pages shorter I would have given it 5 stars."
"Positive","So so so cute: This is the cutest dog I have ever seen. She is adorable. Her outfits are adorable and I really really really really want her. She is so cute. Everone should get her. She is 1000000000000000000000000000000000% times cuter than the My Scene dogs. The My Scene dogs are ugly. this dog is cute and adorable. Get her."
"Negative","No good for new moms: I was tired of using disposables so I wanted to try these...I was so excited because they felt less 'plasticky' than the disposables and claimed to have a boundary to prevent leakage. I didn't mind that they weren't very discrete under my nursing bra/cami and that they shifted around a little. What made them useless was that they let milk get through my bra and shirt after less than a couple hours of use. They didn't actually seem to leak through to the other side, they seem to collect milk and then let it sink down to the rim of the pad where it leaks at the edge of the pad. So much leaked through!I did read some reviews that said reusables aren't good for early nursers...so I will try them again when my milk doesn't really flow as much. Still keeping my review as only 1 star since they leaked when they're not supposed to."
"Positive","AB's Awesome: I have been making AB's chocolate chip cookies since the first time I watched ""Three Chips for Sister Marsha"" and love them. I have wanted AB's baking book since it first came out but was to afraid to buy it because I thought it would be full of recipes by weight and not volume. All I can say is WOW! I should have known that AB would never let me down. Every recipe gives you the option of measuring by weight or volume and as usual AB has made everything easy to understand. Reading this book makes me feel like ""Good Eats"" has come directly into my home. As usual, AB rocks! Thanks AB (and my husband) for a wonderful baking book!"
"Positive","Rock lights for offroad: Purchased Tantrum lights to use as rock or spotting lights for offroading at night and to use as work lights when I have a flat tire etc... They emit a clear bright light that is more than sufficient for my intended needs."
"Negative","Pass on this one: Product writes very well - just does not write for long. The amount of ink in the barrel of the pen is a lot less than it looks - 3 of the pens used so far (in 3 hours of use over a 2 week period) ran completely out of ink. For the price I am very disappointed in the product. I recommend you try another brand."
"Negative","No Way !: If you know the real deal like: Kimber Kable, MIT, Audioquest, ... you wouldn't say Monster Cable ""Awesome""! Monster Cables is OK but wayyyyyyyyyy over priced (probably to pay for their mass marketing, not the technology).I currently own a pair of Monster speaker cables and they are NOT worth the money I paid."
"Positive","Mole Trap - It Works!: This mole trap does catch moles, although its a bit difficult to set. Takes a lot of strength and I cannot do it so I have get my husband to re-set it when we need to do so. It caught 2 moles in the front yard and we are seeing no new mounds in that area, at least! Also, according to package directions, which we followed, one has to dig up a bit more of one's lawn to embed the device than the mole has already dug up. Still, for the price and a bit of patience, it gets the job done."
"Positive","Not bad for Price: Able to charge and plug earpiece in with phone in clip. Clip is sturdy with few breakable pieces. Only bad thing about is clip protrudes out too far and rubs your skin raw, you have to move it around frequently to prevent from hurting yourself."
"Positive","I'm addicted: Weird mixture of hilarious, historically based, way too real. Picked one up on tape to stay awake during a couple of hours' trip, have both read and listened to them ever since.Fortunately there really are twenty-some in the series. And the tone of them varies, one with world's silliest ending, one that just made me sad. This one is pretty big on military history (the names have been changed to suit the series!)."
"Positive","Love Love Love this movie!: A very realistic cop movie. Jake Gyllenhaal was excellent as well Michael Pena. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and recommend it 100%!!!!!"
"Negative","Very disappointing: I have purchased every book on baseball stadiums I can get my hands on. I have 10 different books on the subject and this one is by far and away the least informative of each one. The potential existed for Von Goeben to do a very nice book on the history of baseball stadiums, yet he chose the easy way out and did a book on the subject. Some authors take pride in their work and if Von Goeben takes pride in this one he should be ashamed of himself. Perhaps three or four pictures I have never seen before are in this book, all others are ones he regurgitatedfrom other vastly superior baseball stadium books. Save your money and purchase better books on baseball stadiums such as ""TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL PARK"" by Josh Leventhal (Make sure you get the updated Leventhal book) and ""AMERICAS BALLPARKS"" by New York City Firefighter Kenneth Hogan."
"Positive","Yeah, these guys rock!: Check this one out if you like a hard kinda psychedelic sound. Take Pink Floyd and Primus, add a metal edge and you have ""Windigo"". Of course they add thereown, very unique sound (such as a dijerido solo). They also put on a heluva live show! This CD stays in the CD changer for a week at a time!"
"Positive","Great seat!: So far we really like this seat. It was easy to install, adjust, use. Our daughter seems to like it too. Lots of sleepy car trips. There are only two small things that are not 100% to my liking. The first is the buckle is very low and sometimes hard to get to. Not a real issue for me however. The second is that rear facing, it is kind of large, making it kind of hard to get her in as opposed to her other, smaller seat. Again not a big deal, and we will be turning it around very soon. All in all, quite happy."
"Positive","Best Toning DVD: I use the DVD multiple times a week and boy she still can kick my rear to Timbuktu and back. Love it. Best DVD out there for toning your body. Want to look lean and feel strong? Get this DVD ASAP!"
"Positive","12 Angry Men: I used this movie in my Government class. It led to quite a discussion and resulted in a better understanding of our jury system."
"Negative","BAD....Cop Movie: One of the worst bad cop movies I've ever seen and a waste of time. Totally unrealistic and quite a fairy tale. I can't believe the caliber of actors that tried, unsuccessfully, to make this a good film."
"Negative","Keynes is re- born as Krugman: Prof. Krugman at least is no apologist when it comes to supporting Keynes and his brand of economics. Not being an apologist , however , doesn't mean he is right. In fact mathematical expression of economics is totally devoid of reality. Economics cannot be simplied into equations, which is what Mr. Krugamn wants us to believe. Mant people in high places have come out strongly disagreeing with the medicine Mr. Krugman proposed and continues to propose for Japan's problems. I would suggest that most people should not pay much attention to the prescriptions in this book as we had similar Keynesian type policies discredited."
"Positive","Pachmayr Signiture Grips with Backstrap S & W, 59,: Perfect fit and feel for this pistol. Those with smaller hands who don't like the circumference of this pistol's handle will benefit because it is a little slimmer than the standard grips, especially if you leave the separate, back section off. This and the general fit and texture of the grips makes the pistol feel more 1911ish. They fit perfectly and look like they belong on this firearm - like original equipment. The seller shipped it propmptyly and the price is quite reasonable."
"Negative","product showed up water damaged: I would not buy from them again, the product was not as described it was obviously water damaged therefore nearly impossbile to read and turn the pages without breaking the spine. I will not buy from them again."
"Negative","on my knees, baby please, yada, yada, yada: i question the musical appreciation of those who like this album. maybe, i'm even worse b/c i own DJ's 1st & 2nd album ... this album like the 2nd, is extremely trite. w/o question #1 & #2 are HOT, but if you listen to most of his songs (more than 1nce), you come to realize that the lyrics are nonsensical & uninspiring. that is DJ's trademark: tight musical stylings, mediocre singing & WACK lyrics. unfortunately, most of the album lacks musical substance of the standout tracks, which makes the overall album unbearable. i considered giving DJ 2 stars, but 1 of the few goods songs was a remake (btw, Stevie did it better!)."
"Negative","Junk, lasted two cycles before LCD row burned out: I thought it was just the battery, but the entire 2nd horizontal row burned out, making it unreadable within MINUTES of using! Literally 5 minutes use and its junk. Needs a reset button (To reset time, need to pause, then hit M and S together. Rather flimsy device. If I didnt throw away the packaging, I would have returned it to the store - although driving it back would cost as much in gas & burn up an hour of my day. MADE IN CHINA. I should have learned by NOW!"
"Positive","Great Movie!: My husband and I rented this charming movie one evening and loved it! It is sweet, silly, funny and highly entertaining. I would highly recommend this movie for a fun family night. This movie is clean and is wholesome entertainment for the youngsters."
"Positive","Charming and Delightful: Anyone who has ever struggled with the complexities of having a career and being a devoted parent at the same time will be able to identify with the many anecdotes that Lisa Belkin relates. She covers a myriad of situations that career mothers face in the everlasting struggle to balance ""life's work."" The book is a fast and relaxing read that makes one realize that as hard as you may try, you ""can't do it all."""
"Negative","sounds like deepak: The lines quoted in the Amazon review are straight out of THE RETURN OF MERLIN by Deepak Chopra."
"Positive","Generally good; viewing angle annoying: I agree with most of what the previous reviewer said. What I dislike most is the are extremely narrow viewing angle and the lack of antireflective coating. Otherwise, it is a generally good device.My wish list for the next version includes built-in Wi-Fi and the ability to browse the network neighborhood and pull media files from any machine on the local wireless network, and an internet browser :-)"
"Negative","Everything is great EXCEPT...: I am a massage therapist and bought this little sound system for my office to use during sessions. The sound is fine, everything is fine EXCEPT! When my iPod transitions from track to track, the speakers pop when one track ends and another begins. It's a small thing, but an extremely annoying one that happens several times during a session. It doesn't happen on any other sound system I've tried, so I was surprised and disappointed when I noticed it happening on this one.Now I've got to go get another system and I'm going to buy it in-store somewhere so I don't run into this problem again."
"Positive","All About Braising: A wonderful book full of great recipes that are instructive and easy to follow. A great read if you are into the philosophy of cooking."
"Positive","Recipes are very involved, but great book: After watching the recent movie about Julie Child, I felt compelled to get this book. It is not exactly a quick recipe guide, in fact the recipes are rather involved and challenging. I am enjoying the few items I have made from the book and hope you do to."
"Positive","Intricate and lovely: Hauntingly beautiful melodies from the ancient and medieval times are combined in this album with creative percussion lines and rhythms. This makes for a unique blend of complex and intricate music that still remains truly listenable. The melodies are modal and based in the chant tradition, but the rhythmic additions make the music more accessible to modern ears than strict chant.A favorite track of mine is ""De Profundis,"" which opens with a vocal chant and then melds into a poignant and uplifting melodic line. The forward movement of the piece is carried through by the raindrop-like percussion in the background.The artistry of the Empire Brass Quintet amazes me. At times brass ensembles feel too ""brassy"" for my taste; this group brings out all of the beauty and sensitivity of its instruments. The album encompasses the range from majestic to intimate, and should not be missed."
"Positive","Kids: I ordered these and had them sent to my grandson for his new baby. I have never used these kind of bottles but they are what the kids wanted. I'm 63 things were different in my day."
"Negative","Very cheap and flimsy.: This flag is very cheap in construction. Flag itself is very thin and could never be used on a moving vehicle as it would surely shred very quickly. The field of my flag also has a stain on it."
"Positive","Great little book.: This book is packed with great vintage illustrations from Halloweens past. As an artist who is heavily inspired buy Halloween imagery this book has been invaluable. I actually ended up wearing mine to pieces. But for the price it's really hard to complain. A little book glue and it's as good as new. This book is one of my favorite in my collection. Definitely worth the cheap price tag for anyone who is into this kind of thing."
"Negative","Well, it's ... different.: Keeping an open mind, I was prepared to read an objective work on modern day ""cults,"" which, oddly enough, include almost every world religion. What I found was a completely biased, mean-spirited jab at every belief system that didn't smack of hard-core Christianity. No one, but the most rabid Christian, could possibly find this book interesting, enlightening, or even entertaining. It is an insult that a Baptist minister chooses to wield immaturity and prideful judgement as a weapon against others. His uneducated ramblings are honestly not worth the time and labor used to print this book. Consider this ""work"" just another incarnation of Bible Belt Trash."
"Negative","No, no, and no!: With the craze of unnecessary items for children that are over hyped, I decided to purchase one of these for my son when he was younger. Big mistake. He never once enjoyed this device and henceforth, threw it under the couch, and then in the garage. He treated is as if it was extremely uncomfortable for him and he never bit on it at all. The ""berry"" portion of this device is too large for the average infant's mouth.So one begs the question..What is the benefit in this thing?"
"Negative","Piracy - the problem and the solution!: If you've read any of the other reviews you know what the major problem with this game is. My recomendation is to get a pirated copy of the game. The very thing they were trying to stop by ruining their game is the very solution to the problem.Don't pay for this game. Punish them for what they've done to honest paying gamers by witholding the thing they want the most, your money."
"Positive","READ THIS BOOK!!!: I just loved this. How could you not? It's warm and lovely and really paints such a memorable picture. I totally got it, in terms of understanding not only the women, but the author. He sincerely cared about these women. I've read all the millions of Jackie books and Kennedy books, and this is the one I will always go back to because it's such a heartwarming work. I also saw the movie, and loved it -- but not as much as the book. Isn't that always the case? I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Jackie, and to anyone who may want to know a lot more about Joan and Ethel. I've also read this author's book about Princess Grace called Once Upon a Time and it, too, really made me think. This author writes the best books, if you ask me."
"Negative","This book is far too old: This book was published in the early 1990s and is a collection of articles from Model Airplane News from the previous several years. As such, it's woefully out of date.If you're new to radio control aircraft, buy one of the many newer books on the market. Much, much, much has changed in the past 3-5 years, particularly related to electric motor flight, foam models (as opposed to balsa and ply), ready-to-fly (everything in one box--airplane, transmitter, onboard electronics, and only 30 minutes assembly time), newer stabilizing and control surfaces (winglets on sailplanes, for example), microelectronics, computer radios (transmitters), quantum leaps in battery technology (lithium polymer), etc.The field has changed. This book hasn't."
"Negative","Important Topics, No Substance: I approached this book with the utmost hopefulness since there has not been one to date on Asian American youth. Unfortunately, now that I am no longer in my teens I have a difficult time relating to their borderline cliche reflections. For sure the anthology could have done without the ""Now I'm in this Ivy League college"" biographies and most of the poetry, about which I wonder if the authors won't be a bit embarrassed later on. This was a much-needed effort, but just because there is urgency does not warrant slack editing."

"Positive","Funny and accurate: Al Franken's book is not only funny but suprisingly detailed in its skewering of the republicans. Franken unearths every shred of hipocrosy and contradiction other liberals miss. He mocks the seriousness of political books but also provides better information than most. He shows that the puffed up arrogance of the Right has nothing to do with fact. With the republicans riding high you can't afford to miss this."
"Negative","Disappointment: Finally we got this album, but it was not up to what I anticipated. Overall it was just disappointing vocally and musically. Probably won't be playing this one much. Very disappointed in the lyrics too."
"Positive","pretty good product: Because I have never used a product with witch hazel or rose petals this was a completely different product as to a normal toner with alcohol. Compared to what I have used in the passed this is very very easy on the skin it has a strong rose fragrents if you like the smell of Rose this is for you I wish I had went with the lavander.I'm not sure that it's toning my skin the way I had hoped but I will keep using it. It make my skin feel rejuvinated & clean."
"Negative","kitty pad: well i got this for a outside cat. Plugged it inside first and it barely got warm( more like on the bottom). took it outside and put it in a tub and it never even got warm enough to attract the cat to stay on it. So for my benefit i donated the money on this one. Not good for what it claimed for me anyway.This was put in a shed so it wasnt out side in the weather. When i got it the weather was chilly but not cold. The cats do better on their own snugglin up in the hay."

"Negative","CHINESE JUNK: THIS IS NOT THE CAN OPENER YOUR MOTHER HAD. THIS IS A CHINESE KNOCK OFF. WORKED FOR ABOUT 6 MOS. NOW THE SOFT METAL GEARS AND CUTTER WON'T OPEN CANS. WE USE THIS IN A HOME KITCHEN AND IT HAS NOT BEEN MISUSED IN ANY WAY. I HAVE 2 OF THE HAND HELD CAN OPENERS BY SWING A WAY THEY ALSO SUFFER FROM METAL FATIGUE. THEY STILL WORK BUT NO BETTER THAN ONE FROM THE LOCAL GROCERY STORE. THEY ALL STARTED OUT FINE BUT THE CHEAP METAL SOON GAVE OUT. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
"Positive","The last story: This was the BEST HORSE BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!!!!! I was very sad when I read the last word. I mean they didn't have a ending! What is Allie's Wonder going to be, a racer or eventer? What happens to Christina and Parker? Don't they get married?? Well, I've have read every book except #42 and #56. I have only rated 2 or 3 books with 3 stars. All the other's were GREAT!!!! I wish they ending it differently though. I mean, your ENDING THE BOOKS why didn't you end it with all of the old charaters? I mean couldn't you add a closing chapter that says "" 20 years later......."" and tells what happens. I HOPE THAT YOU RESTART THE BOOKS!!!!!!!!!! READ THESE BOOKS, THEY HAVE MADE BE SO MUCH SMARTER IN MY HORSE KNOWLEDGE!!!!!!!!"
"Positive","Works Great!: This product works really great. My husband and I have enjoyed it very much. The batteries have lasted great and it has decent volume for the shower. Overall it is an awesome product."
"Negative","Dress to Kill just kills me!!: Izzard is too funny in this DVD. There as so many quotable lines in this thing - me and my kids watch it a lot. I plan to buy all his DVD's."
"Negative","Stylus broke, bad hum: I got this because of its good reviews. I read about the terrible hum, and kind of disregarded it because I wanted a good cartridge for cheap. For about a month, it worked perfectly, then it started humming. Today (about 4 months after buying it) the stylus snapped in half while playing a record."
"Positive","Damn, but this book was great!: This was the first book I've ever read by Holden, and it was an immense pleasure. It's a story of two cops, both flawed in their own different ways, tracking down a missing child. The twist is that one of the cops had his own child disappear years earlier. The characters in this book are so human, so real, so utterly believable...and the prose is just a dream. Holden writes like a poet, with supreme skill and depth. If you enjoy the literary suspense thrillers of folks like James Lee Burke and the better works of Dennis Lehane and George Pelecanos, you'll get a kick out of this one. It's got action, it's got heart, and it's a just a damn good read."
"Negative","A CRAPPY LIVE ALBUM: DONT BUY THIS HORRIBLE ALBUM.IT IS'NT LIVE AT ALL.IT IS MADE IN THE STUDIO WITH SPECTATOR VOICES ADDED ON TO THE MUSIC.ZERO STARS.GET FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE FROM PETER FRAMPTON INSTEAD."
"Positive","A Great Book: This book is good. At first nothing is really happening, and all at once things start to happen, and it doesn't stop until the very end. I like how she had two suspects and you couldn't tell who the bad one was. It was scary at the end, but it was a great book."
"Negative","Irwin snips, Lefts and Rights: I have been a union sheet metal worker for some 32 years. The last set of snips I purchased were ""Pro Snips"" by Vice Grip company. These were the best snips I have ever owned. Since Vice Grip was purchased by Irwin their snips have changed dramatically....for the worst I'm afraid. Although I believe these snips have their place, they are not ""heavy duty"" enough for the rigors of day in and day out industrial sheet metal work. They are much to thin to hold up to serious cutting (max thicknesses). I was very disappointed and will be shopping for something different very soon."
"Positive","A Good Beginning: If you want a good laser pointer, and a good Swiss Army knife, this is your pick. It's a strong, compact laser pointer, and it has a penknife, a scissor, and a nailcleaner."
"Positive","squirrel target: I really can't rate it because I got it for my grandson but he is certainly using it to get ready for hunting squirrels"
"Negative","F552D/830: I bought this replacement lamp 2D 55W Joyful Daylight 120V AC.The original GE bulb had a much warmer color and make the room verybright and yet comfortable. This replacement bulb is not recommendedand *do not* waste your money to get this bulb."
"Negative","A Messege from AL-Qur'an will be enough, i guess: In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.No falsehood can approach it(The Qur'an) from before or behind it; it is sent down by One Full of Wisdom, worthy of all Praise. (AL-Qur'an, Chapter 41, Verse 42)"
"Positive","Great Book for studying the text!: If you are studying the text for a paper or getting it up on it's feet for a play, I highly recommend this publisher. Lines notes and Folio version notes, the only text like it on the market.My only complaint is that it makes it difficult to use in rehearsals and on stage. I use the Penguin for working on my feet because they give you all notes at the end.But for all the prep work needed to really flush out a character, you can't beat this copy."
"Negative","You get what you pay for: Star Office isn't bad if you are looking for a simple Office suite with watered down features and very little support. With Star Office, you are on your own. Sun touts Star Office as a strong competitor to Microsoft Office. Hardly. Use this product for yourself if you like but remember, Star Office is free. Based on this, how much time do you think Sun will put into supporting, troubleshooting and enhancing this product? Also, given Sun's track record with how bugs are addressed in it's server side products, there isn't much hope regarding resolving issues in this product. Lastly, Sun is a hardware company. They have never been strong in software development and, with the introduction of Star Office, they maintain that track record.If you want serious integration in your Office Suite, Microsoft Office is still the top choice. Remember, you get what you pay for."
"Negative","Don't Buy This Vacuum: It is awful! It has been just over 1 year that I have had it, but It no longer works. It runs yes, but it doesn't suck anything up. Instead it blows everything on your floor around into this cloud of dust. I have gone onto Bissell's website and apparently enough people have had the same problem for them to have troubleshooting tips for this problem. None of them work, so I had to go out an purchase another vacuum. I decided to purchase the Dyson for pet hair, and so far I love it. I could have saved myself $270 by purchasing it in the first place. I guess we learn from our mistakes!"
"Negative","Gaiman wrote this?: I read this book--bought it in hardcover, in fact--because I loved Neverwhere. I was surprised to find out that more often than not, the stories here are pretty annoying. Either they don't make sense, or they're just plain boring. I just finished Stardust, and it was every bit as good as Neverwhere, or even better. Guess you win some and lose some."
"Negative","wg311 adapter: Very difficult to configure to even work. Unreliable and would not maintain connection. downloading and installing new driver did not help."

"Negative","Good Product, Bad Supplier: If you're going to buy this printer dont get it from the supplier ""Imagewarehouse"" in the used or new section. It does not come with a drum unit which is an extra $50 from Dell, and is not listed as is. At least they said it comes with no toner. As far as speed, print, and reliability this is a great printer but just know THAT THIS IS NOT A COLOR PRINTER!!!! I was under the impression that it was. Its just B&W but nontheless a great printer."

"Negative","Republican cover for the creeping EU coup: Mr Hari is inded a 'non-journalist', as John Pilger describes him. He is arrogant, ignorant and pompous beyond his years. It's no surprise that the reactionary Trotskyite and Bush-loving fool Christopher Hitchens likes him. This damns them both! Hari hates the British royal family and wants to get rid of them in order to make it easier for Tony Blair to abolish Britain's sovereignty and make us a province of a new undemocratic state called Europe. This would open the door for Blair to become President not just of Britain but of Europe. A new Pope, indeed!"
"Positive","works like a charm!: I saw the price and wondered what the catch was. I know this is a generic brand, but so far it has worked like a charm! no errors at all."
"Positive","Good psychological suspense: Tate Collier and his ex-wife Bett, are reunited to search for their missing daughter Megan, in this quite suspenseful psychological thriller. Aaron Matthews is a highly intelligent psychologist (and psycho) who can talk people into believing almost anything. The paths of Tate and Bett will soon cross with that of Matthews and we learn that something in Tate's past is the reason his daughter is missing.Filled with a few surprises and emotional situations, Deaver has written a satisfying story with some good characters. Matthews' use of language instead of tools (although tools are sometimes used) to knock his victims down, is a good change of pace. Overall, it's a good, quick entertaining read.Recommended"
"Positive","Love this series!: I am thrilled to have found this series! I'm actually dragging my feet on book six because I don't want it to end!"
"Positive","Touching, Heartwarming, Easy-to-Read book: The little book is pretty straight to the point. Each person teaches readers a lesson of life. An easy-to-read page-turner that's suitable for readers of all ages. If you're looking for something 'sophisticated', like another reviewer said, this is not your type of book. But it's a light-hearted summer reading book."
"Positive","Mission Collection Computer Desk and Hutch: For what you are paying this is a great desk and hutch (only $99.00 for the desk). Very sturdy, solid wood. I put both pieces together, by myself (non-powered screwdriver) in about 1 hour. I was amazed that all the pieces fit together without any problems lining up the pegs and camlocks. Everything went together easily using a bit of common-sense (look at the pictures-not the written directions and line up all the holes before trying to screw it together.)It's desk surface is a bit on the small size (have a 19 inch monitor on it), but in an apartment dorm or bedroom, it's small size turns into a plus. I'm actually planning to buy another desk (same brand and type) to use with the one I already have. I'll put it at a right angle to this one and use it as a writing desk. when I move into a bigger place."
"Negative","Not that great: As I read these each day (now one month's worth) I am unimpressed. They are statements that I don't feel are inspiring. Someone else may like it but I am ready to put it away as soon as I receive my new calendar."
"Negative","Don't waste your time.: This book is entirely too slow. It seems to just repeat the same thing in every chapter. I agree with the the other review that says this is just an extended guide on Jewish genealogy. Very disappointed."
"Negative","The House Next Door: This novel tricked us. We expected an adult mystery novel, but instead it was much more like what a teen would enjoy. Very predictable and because of that, boring and a waste of time."
"Negative","Short life span, good while it lasted.: I bought my Kodak Easyshare CX7330 in February of 2005. It did well although the older it got, the more it ate batteries. With the money I have spent on batteries I would have been better off getting one with a charger and a pack. I have also tried every type of AA battery out there and it is the camera itself with the issues. Now, 2 and a half years later it has taken it's last pictures. The trouble began with when I would turn it on the indicator light would pop up green, then immediately flash red and the lens would not extend out. Sometimes it would work, sometimes not. Now I can put fresh batteries in and if I hold it just right I can take a few pictures, then the low battery icon comes on the screen and it goes dead, even without retracting the lens. As I said, it was a great little camera while it lasted, but I think I will get something more hardy next time."
"Positive","It's about time: The blend of Southwest Lousiana with today's best stuff going. A perfect blend of organic and electronic music. Soothing for any soul. A must buy"
"Positive","Overall, I like it!: The first lamp that I purchased failed on arrival. Contacted Amazon and they had a replace out in two days. Lamp is fairly easy to put together. However, you need to be careful during assembly. The coating seems to scratch fairly easy. This lamp is more for reading than anything else. It covers a small area; but the light is bright; but not harsh making it much easier toread a book. I like the goose neck feature because it makes it easier to adjust the lamp to your reading material."
"Positive","Exceeded expectations greatly!: I was expecting this shift knob to be a cheap alternative to other leading companies with weighted shifted knobs, because other companies didn't offer my thread pitch. I have heard bad things about universal shift knobs such as rattling and not feeling very solid; this shifter has been stiff and solid threw multiple hard shifts. I have taken it off multiple times and the self tapped plastic insert has been just as stiff as the first time it was threaded. I was very please with the feel and quality of the product!"
"Positive","Fantastic: The best adaptation of Arthurian legend I've ever read. I only wish Steinbeck had finished it."
"Negative","Chronic 2001 compilation? by wacky ""West Coast"" and friends: Everybody who keeps talking about ""this CD is an excellent follow up"" to ""The Chronic"" and ""Dre is back"" needs to shut up with all that bull cuzz this CD sucks. This CD sounds like a weak compilation or soundtrack, not an album. To tell you the truth, I'd rather listen to some East Coast and Dirty South stuff like DMX, Eve, Juvenile, Lil' Wayne, or Hot Boys, not Dre and his West Coast buddies. This CD is all hype and bull! Plus, the ""Forget About Dre"" is the worst attempt at his conforming to Hip-Hop's status quo of bounce Hip-Hop! While Eminem is cool, Dre's Eminem-penned flow is all offbeat and pretentious. This CD sucks! FFF-"
"Positive","Classical Relaxation Time: Telemann was really in touch with his Italian musical flavor in most of his works. Unlike JS Bach, Telemann keeps creating new/innovative ways to expand his style whereas Bach continued using ""rhythmic formulas"" (ingeniusly constructed mind you) to further his stamp on the Baroque world. Telemann advances toward Rocco in some of his works and there lies the freshness his style brings."
"Positive","Love this boombox!: This is just what I was looking for. Very easy to use and carry around. Also, the sound is clear!"
"Positive","Anarchist metal.: Spiral Architect doesn't dig the concept of ""boundaries"". They don't play by the rules. Deep, mega-complex, absorbing...not easy listening, and honestly it has taken a long, long time for me to even get sucked in by its excellence. Focus often hovers around the phenomenal bass playing of Lars Norsberg, and though your attention will often be focused on him, you'll also want to lend an ear to the amazing musicians complementing. Thinking man's metal? Hell yeah, even if you're Einstein. Neil Kernon produced it, which is an accolade in itself. Buy it."
"Positive","very english sounding american music.: fantastic 5 song EP of creepy songs inspired by the stories of j.s. lefanu, a 19th century master of the english ghost-story. this wonderful american band sounds very british here, indeed. and very sixties sounding too. the excellent closing track, ""laura silver bell"" could have fit right in on any left banke or love album from the late sixties. the recording is filled with a variety of textures, from tinkling bells in a baby's nursery, to peels of thunder, with harpsicords, mandolin, orchestration, hypnotic lazy bass lines, and nice electric guitar along the way. songs about evil uncles, ghosts (of course), people who drink tea that brings out bad and scary things in them, and girls whose beauty brings them a bad dose of fate. all in all, another fine outting from the green pajamas, a very talented band that i cannot get enought of."
"Positive","Works well - enjoy using it.: This steamer works well especialy on items I do not want iron marks on, like sweaters and softly hanging skirts/dresses. Good value for the price."
"Negative","Hated it: I found the premise of this book to be totally unbelievable. Maybe I am too ""cosmopolitan,"" but I find it impossible to believe that in the mid-1990s, the setting for this book, a father would kick out of the house and stop speaking to a daughter who, apparently at least 30 years old, becomes pregnant and decides to have the child. In addition, we are expected to believe the whole town condemns her and her ""loose morals"" and character deficits. We're also expected to believe this same man would leave his most treasured possessions to a man who has little, if any, respect and affection for him, and that he would suggest this same man to be his ""illegitimate"" granddaughter's legal guardian! What a bunch of hogwash."
"Positive","Authour recreates his own life story.: Neil Albert's ""monthly series"" continues in its 6th entery. This time Dave Garret is set out to solve a totaly different case. He is looking for his biological parents.The author states that this is based on his search for his birth parents and that brings a more human emotion to the story itself.Alberts intertwining chapters of different naratives actually gives two interesting prespectives to the same story.As the story opens we find Dave in his office with nothing to do, basicly jobless buy with a job. Until he is presued to find his father, his biological father. He sets out to California where his mother stayed during her pregnancy with her family. He hopes he will be able find the truth there but it leads to nowhere. With a twist of fate and a confession Dave is sent on the right track and you are left with a great mystery."
"Negative","Falling apart after 5 months: I got this chair to be my office chair at work. I'm not particularly large and don't do anything unusual with it, but the staples holding the mesh to the back frame have started coming out after 5 months of regular use. It's a comfortable chair, but this lack of durability is unacceptable. And it's not even my personal money I spent on it."
"Negative","Buying sight unseen has its downsides: The ear piece is way too large to fit in your ear and so falls out easily when used."
"Negative","Book not in good condition: I got the book to have it signed by its author Bob Schieffer. Unfortunately, the book was not in a good condition at all. Half of the front page was ripped off and there was a ""low prize"" button on the cover that I could not get off."
"Positive","Fascinating first hand accounts of men captured and living among the Indians: Very interesting book about American colonialists, settlers, hunters and other men being captured and living among Native Americans for several years. Each story is captivating and gives you an appreciation of what these men endured. Some of the captives were adopted into the tribe and forgot alot of their ""white man"" ways throughout the years and were relunctant and ill-at-ease when they returned to the foreign ""white man"" world. Some accounts are very brutal and alot of these men's families and friends were butchered before their eyes. Some accounts are peaceful and just as interesting. Overall, a very interesting read that is recommended!!"
"Positive","Proctor Silex Coffee Grinder: Works good. Small. Grinds enough coffee for 1 pot of coffee at a time. I would recommend it for home use."
"Positive","A wonderful read for UGA fans: The snippets of UGA superstars from Trippi, Sinkwich, Dooley and Walker to Debbie Norville and Kim Basinger are worth the price of the book. Any UGA grad/fan would welcome this under the Christmas tree or anytime. Can't wait for the sequel."
"Positive","Must Have: This has always been a favorite song of mine and it's great to share it with my daughter, along with the beautiful illustrations. We love to sing along with our books, and this one is a real winner!"
"Positive","pot for canning: I bought this pot for canning (I make my own salsa - up to 100 qts) as I got tired of using my 6 & 8 qt pots at the same time. I've got over 30 calphalon pots/pans and although I prefer the quality of their products when they were made in Toledo, Ohio (several years ago), this is of similar quality of their ""made in china line""."
"Negative","Don't buy this book, it isn't worth the paper or ink: (...)Can we talk just about the writing, the punctuaiton, the wrong use of words the confusion of verb-tense?Can we also talk about a woman, who claims to be 40, who thinks that at 21 she had finally learned to become a woman? You might think that at 21, but by 40 one would like to believe that wisdom and self-reflection would give you perspective on how young we really are at 21. (...)"
"Negative","NOT VEGAN: This product is NOT VEGAN. LEGALLY, something cannot be labeled as vegan if it has BEESWAX in it. I am using it because I bought it and I opened it without noticing the label so some bees suffered somewhere for it for no reason if I throw it out, but I am really ****ing pissed that this was labeled vegan and it is not."
"Negative","BURNED CD: This really was the body of the evidence, this CD it's sold by a site called ArkivMusik, a third partner in the AmazonMarketPlace, if you expect a new CD factory sealed, forget it, you will receive a BURNED CD...if you want only one, they ship 3 copies of the same, if you don't want a real headache, let it pass..., this Mercury Recording it wasn't conducted by Bernard Herrmann.There is a re-recording on Varese Saravande Label"
"Positive","""On The Heels Of ""Nursery Crymes"": I think this is a true achievement in the history of recorded music. ""Supper's Ready"" alone is a true pinnacle in the catalog of Genesis' music. ""Watcher Of The Skies"" is one of my favorites as well. This is another recording that ""sounds old"" to some. but is treasured by others. A must for any Prog Rock Fan."
"Positive","12 month web access?: I purchased this card knowing that it's a 12 month gold access card. When I received the card and it's stamped with the 12 month gold logo.After I entered the keys and activated it, the membership read 12 + 1 month gold access. So there you go, you get a free month from Microsoft."
"Negative","Common Sense: ""It's just plain common sense that there be a waiting period to allow local law enforcement officials to conduct background checks on those who wish to buy a handgun.""- Ronald Reagan *endorsing* the Brady handgun control bill, at a March 1991 event commemorating 10th anniversary of the assassination attempt."
"Negative","Vintage Frankowski, for good or bad: This is a fairly typical Frankowski novel, written in a typical Frankowski voice. If you have read any of his other novels, you'll recognize the narrator by his self-righteous yet wry attitude towards everything. I must confess that I found myself fairly bored by the book, having abandoned it at around 2/3s mark. Having said that, it's not really horrible...just not very good."
"Positive","FTM 16 is the best FTM yet: It's too bad that Family Tree Maker has changed hands so frequently that the new management teams feel compelled to ""dum"" down the users. FTM 16 was the pinnacle and they went down hill from there. Why ""upgrade"" with real ""downgrades""? Change should contain improvements not change just for the convenience of company management who is constantly watching the bottom line or is just not familiar with the needs of the consumer. They obviously lost a tremendous amount of market share. My suggestion to FTM is to hire technical people who know genealogy and let them develop the best possible product starting with the FTM 16 platform."
"Positive","Great documentary: This was an excellent documentary about Everest and the history of those who tried to climb it as well as the countries these men and women represented. The only thing that would have made this documentary better would be for it to have included more information about their gear and the cost of getting to and from base camp and the like."
"Negative","DO NOT BUY!: I just received this product in the mail today and tested it out on my iPhone and computer, but it never worked it would not work on one ear and would screw-up what the track was playing. Waste of money."
"Negative","Only worked some of the time...: I would recommend against buying these speakers. They look very cool, and I really wanted them to work well. The price was right, but the sound was only marginally better than the speakers on my laptop, and they just didn't work consistently with all applications. When they did work, they were static'y and again, just didn't offer that much of an advantage over the laptop's built in speakers. I sent it/them back to Amazon. The Logitech V20 speakers cost more and aren't as compact, but they actually work! I ended up with them and overall I am satisfied."
"Positive","Great CD if I had never heard her first CD.: This sounded great. I've had the CD for 2 years now, and I still love it!! Her voice is so unique, and strong. I wish she'd leave the remakes alone though. She is better than the original! Do your own thing girl!!!"
"Negative","Did not last long: I got this in October 2012 and by mid-January 2013 it has fallen apart. I need to see if there is any kind of warranty, but that is less than three months."
"Positive","The Perfect Thin Front Pocket Wallet: I have been through many wallets over the years constantly not being satisfied with them.Recently, I decided to slim down, ditch the credit cards and other junk I really don't need so I began to look for a smaller front pocket wallet. I tried a few with money clips. I tried magnetic ones as well as mechanical ones. The magnetic one I got was a mistake, because when I work out, I was putting it in the same pouch of my backpack as my watch. Low and behold, magnets kill analog watches.So the search was on again for a good one.That is when I stumbled across the View Slimmy on Amazon. I immediately fell in love with the design of it and ordered it.I can say with certainty that this is the best slim front pocket wallet I have ever seen and/or had. It is perfect if you are looking for a wallet that will only need to hold 2-3 cards, an ID and a small amount of cash.I highly recommend it if your wallet needs fit that criteria."
"Negative","Paid for movie wouldn,t download.: Paid for movie wouldn,t download. tryed on all my devices. the unbox won,t work with any of my computers.for movies i,m sticking with itunes.now i can,t even buy the movie."
"Positive","I Rode The Pink Pig: Being a native of Atlanta born in 1962, reading ""I Rode The Pink Pig,""brought back many cherished holiday memories spent at Rich's downtown.Pictures with Santa in my best velvet dresses; The green Christmas tree shaped candy for sitting in his lap; Being a proud shopper at Santa'sSecret Shop using my own allowance money; Breakfast with Santa, includingmy favorite, rice crispies mixed with vanilla icecream; The ""Great Tree"" with ornaments so large it created a sense of awe; But most of all,the anticipation and joy of riding the ""Pink Pig"" around the roof of Rich's dept. store overlooking the city. I still have a white, satin badgewith Priscilla's smiling face, declaring ""I Rode The Pink Pig,"" to prove it. This book is filled with nostalgic, ""home grown"" traditions, that continue living on in the hearts of children young and old!Thanks for the memories,Sharon PoseyDunwoody, GA"
"Positive","O2 sensor: Perfect- My 240 now gets 22mpg instead of 13mpg. My mechanic was right. It is a perfect fit with the right connectors"
"Negative","So-so singing: Her songs are good but she fails to do them justice. Her voice is so airy and ethereal that it lacks body and she sounds as though she is wailing away. The air plays a large part in her lack of control of her voice. In track 3, she sounds as though she is singing with fishballs in her mouth - it was hard for me to distinguish whether she was singing in Mandarin or Cantonese! Red Bean and Face are good songs but then again, with Faye's insipid voice, it's hard for her to control."
"Negative","listen before you buy: I bought this cd because of songs listed which I've heard on satellite. The songs on the cd are not what you hear on the radio- the versions on the cd are mundane and plodding at best- had I been able to listen first I would not have bought this album"
"Negative","Not worth the money: I purchased a pair of these headphones a year ago and they have already broken. I expected more from a company that charges $60 for a pair of headphones. It is not like they needed to re-create the wheel. If you do buy these I recommend sending the warranty. Also the option of the headphones collapsing is a horrible idea. Every time I had to pull them off my head, they would pinch my neck and hair."
"Positive","An Incredible Synthesis: This text is amazing. It takes a comparative approach in providing countless examples of developmental plasticity and its importance in the scope of evolutionary theory. It's truly a synthesis and the prime source for the long-awaited integration of development with evolution."
"Negative","You will get burned two ways!: My husband got burned severely after putting the microwave proof mug in the microwave. Was treated by a doctor several times and missed several days of work. He was scarred and still sensitive. The company made us jump though hoops with documentation of the burns and expenses incurred. In the end they said they would not reimburse us and it was not their responsibility.Burned by the mug and burned by the company.Beware of this company."
"Positive","Just what I needed.: I use this for my tablet & it does exactly what it is supposed to do. The snag-free feature on it is nice."
"Positive","aprons: These were great, have ordered them before. Only one problem, when I pulled one out to embroider it was very short, like for a child. There was only 1 that was like this. My fault I did not check to make sure they were all alike, which I will do next time. Great quality & embroidering on them is a dream."
"Negative","UGH - NOT ONE RECIPE I WILL MAKE: Very dissappointed with the cookbook - I wish i could send it back - there is not one recipe I would consider making - I eat out alot at German restaurants and was hoping for some normal German recipes but the cookbook centers more on the meats I would never eat - UGH - Don't buy this!"
"Negative","no feeling: This joystick has no feel. The horizontal and vertical trim wheels are a joke at best. I had a Microsoft Sidewinder that was far superior. This joystick has a very plastic feel more of a toy than a real sim stick. It sets up easy and is ready to fly in no time but the lack of feel is disturbing."
"Negative","Far From the Best Book on Grief: There are so many magnificent books on the grief experience that it is a shame that this mediocre one is getting so much attention. Ms. Didion used extremely old concepts and references about grief to support what she is saying, showing that her research was severely lacking. She reports on her grief from a distance. A very old book called Widow describes the experience of being a widow in a much more moving, touching manner. This book is cold and I believe is only getting the acolades because Ms. Didion is a famous author. Please, there are better books: buy them!"
"Positive","VERY CANDID: I completely enjoyed reading this book. She tells it just as it was without any PR face. I really apreciate being able to take an in-depth look at how things function and I found the advice invaluable."
"Positive","Love the movie and great shipping: This movie is a great movie for all ages. It teaches you to love one another and has a great soundtrack!! Must Buy!!"
"Positive","An Authentic and Well Researched Book: This book was filled with history and information about the various holidays and special occasions celebrated by Italians and Italian Americans past and present. It included traditions related to Christmas, Easter, Saints' Days, and so much more. There was clearly a lot of reserach that went into this book. I also loved the inclusion of stories and shared recipes from real people, which gave it a personal touch. I highly recommend this classic, charming, info-rich book."
"Positive","chau doc: i was part of this action which drew described in his book. i was evacuated to an ammo boat on the river along with maggie consequently i was not a part of the heroic efforts drew conducted inside the town throughout that day and this clarified many issues for me. i consider myself fortunate that drew, the seals, and the mike force took agressive action when they did or i just might not be alive today to review what he has written.libby ginnettiUSAID Asst. Prov. Rep.Chau Doc ProvinceVietnam 1966-1968"
"Positive","the greatest one: I'm a fan of roxette, and that's the way I knew her. I live in Chile, and here there is not any Marie's album. I went to France on January 99 and I could buy it at there. It's just great! The songs I more like are ""Min trognaste van"",""Ber bara en gang"",""I en tid som var"",""Tro"" and ""Vinterangel"""
"Positive","On Thin Ice: This author creates characters that you can take an interest in getting to know more about and smooth flowing story lines."
"Negative","Lame Book: Don't buy this; the tool stinks and book doesn't provide very good example. FMPro is a badly written piece of software."
"Negative","Disappointing: I have always heard such great things about Feynman and his writting and so I thought I would read this book. What a disappointment! Being the transcript of a series of lectures, it is difficult to follow as he rambles from one topic to another. There doesn't seem to be any coherent focus. He also seems to state things that are fairly obvious or superficial as though they are the great secrets of the universe. I have not given up on Feynman books, but this one was just not worth it."
"Negative","way too technical, boring even...: I'm an average amateur in photography but I love to read about it and I readpretty much anything I can get my hands on.I got this book hoping to know more about exposure and paired it up with amanual 50mm lens to practice because I wanted the hole experience.The book fell short... It's way too technical, even to the point when itbecame boring for me to read because i could have well been written in japannesefor all I care, and then the easy to understand parts where the ones that onlysaid ""check your light meter until it says your exposure is fine"" :sMaybe for more experienced photographers this is THE BOOK, but for me it feltshort and I couldn't relate to the author like I have in other books like theones from Lee Frost for example."
"Negative","A Bigger Budget Equals A Terrible Film: All the charm of the first film has been thrown out the window in favor a big budget Hollywood assembly line garbage.Complete with cheesy fast-motion flashes of people shaking their heads or bodies. It could have been a terrific movie, the concept itself was great. To follow up in the wake of the original film and explore the aftermath. But bad writers and directors got a hold of the film and it was rushed out. This film should be labeled comedy and not horror."
"Negative","Dinosaurs fall flat: We picked up ""If the dinosaurs came back"" because of its beautiful and clear-cut illustrations. The visual impact is very enjoyable.However, the book falls short on its contents. ""If dinosaurs came back"" - yes, what if they did? In this book, their return would be very tame indeed. Dinosaurs could become buses, we learn, dinosaurs could be used as ladders, they could do timberwork in wooded areas, or people could own them like pets and take them for a stroll on a leash. But where is the dinosaur essence here? Where is the rampage, the nutsized brain, the carnivorous jaws, the giantic appetite? If dinosaurs came back, oh what happy mayhem it could be! But in this book the famed old lizards display about as much characteristics as a forgotten chair on a street corner.Verdict: Too infantile - even for the young set (ages 3 and up). But nice pictures."
"Positive","Fantastic series! You won't be disappointed.: If you have not read Sue Grafton's alphabet series try to get a copy of the first one ""A is for Alibi"" and keep going until you catch up with the latest. Grafton's Kinsey Millhone is someone you will care about. She is so true to life, from her old VW to her handy little black dress that can go from crumpled to fashionable in a jiffy. She is down to earth and efficient but can make mistakes just like the rest of us. She has my vote for top female detective. I usually wait for paperbacks but not for Sue Grafton books!"
"Negative","I'M TIRED OF THIS COMPILATIONS !: This band released so much compilations, (like BEE GEES), that you end forgetting their real discography!"
"Positive","Thought provoking: Having lived in the same city in Africa as Ralph, I can vouch for some of his insight in this book. I was in Bouake when the attacks happened here in the USA on 9/11. No-one, amongst the Muslim population was surprised, and in some circles they were celebrating in the streets. Made you think that they were waiting for something to happen, and when it did, it brought many of them out. A year later they took over the city, in a coup d'etat, and I was there too, having to be evacuated, but thanks to some Muslim neighbors my family was kept safe.I have talked to many Muslims also, and believe that Ralph's scenario of end times is quite feasible. Buy this book, read it, and give it some real thought."
"Positive","The subject matter on this cd is real.: Young Dre is one of those rappers nobody knows about but everybody should. He stays real to the ideal of ""Gangsta Rap"". I encourage anyone that likes the Westcoast sound to give this CD a chance."
"Positive","Great alternative to baggy sweats: These sweat pants actually look good. They follow the body lines through the hips and thighs, but are still the same sweat pant material that are popular for lounging around the house in. The pants have a loose fit from just above the knee down, and do not have the old school elastic at the ankle but hemmed instead."
"Positive","Doctor Recommended: My doctor in England recommended this book to me in 2000 and its changed my life. I've not been sick since. It's the only nutrition book you'll need!"
"Negative","I laughed, I cried, I'm glad I bought it used!: This book has a few good ideas interspersed, but is mainly a stream of environmentalist-communist propaganda laced with mysticism passed off as science. This book is NOT recommended for anyone who cannot independently glean the few grains of wheat from the tons of chaff."
"Negative","Harry Potter Wizards Collection US: Getting this item was a horrible experience. Though it clearly stated 'all regions' in the description we received a US coded copy which basically rendered it useless. Long story short: if you want it and you're not in the US then buy it from Amazon.uk."
"Positive","David Wolfe rocks!: Another winner in the Raw Foodists library. Detailed with lots of info and encouragement. Go raw, everybody."
"Positive","It grows on you: The very first time I saw this movie was on television where they aired a special 190 minute version which contained important scenes and a more detailed introduction that makes the movie a lot easier to understand. With out a doubt this has to be one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made visually. I have seen this movie countless times and each time I am amazed by the special effects. I gave this movie 4 stars and not 5 because you have to watch it more than once to understand it. There is just too much going on in this movie than can be taken in the first time you watch it. I also highly suggest watching the extended version to get a far better understanding. If you like to let your imagination go free, you will love this movie as it will become one of your favorite movies ever as it has for me."
"Positive","Great Starter: This was my first stethoscope and it was great. Littmann is always a pleaser. The lightweight quality of it made me feel like it was about to fall off my shoulders. It's very nice and the quality can't be beat. I would suggest upgrading to the slightly more expensive Littmann S.E. II which is not lightweight. I feel that lung and heart sounds are more clear with the original S.E."
"Positive","Maida Heatter reviews some of her best cookie recipes: Maida Heatter's lifetime devotion to baking -- especially cookies -- is very apparent in this instant classic. You will want to start at the beginning and try every recipe to the end. Special favorites are the Whoppers and Palm Beach Brownines. Only thing missing are illustrations. A must have for the serious cookie baker."
"Positive","Great Product: This is just like the one that broke. Of course that one lasted for 3 years with daily use. Good luck with your purchase."
"Negative","Don't bother with this book: When perusing the table of contents, I thought to myself that this book could be really helpful. So I bought it. What a waste.This book is a heaping pile of wasted recycled paper. Most of the chapters don't go into any detail, and the code doesn't have any documentation at all. Advanced Swing? Get Graphic Java 2. JDBC? Read the JDBC tutorial at java.sun.com. Printing? Don't even bother.I got this book because I am confused on printing in Java. The chapter explains what printing is, gives a couple of code samples, and then goes on to the next section.All in all, this book is pointless. Don't waste your money on this one, cuz you will only end up with a $30.00 paper weight."
"Positive","Trim saw blade: The 120 tooth blade handles 1/2 inch Russian Birch plywood like a laser through butter. I use the blades exclusively in cabinet making and find that this 4 1/2 blade is the best for clean precise cuts. Always remember to score your cuts with a utility knife first and there is virtually no rip out.If you are cutting plexiglass or plastics always use a sharp and very clean blade. Cleaning with one of the new 'orange' based producsts is best.Remember to unplug the saw when doing any adjustments."
"Positive","Hitchcock 'Owned': Sure it's over-the-top but it's also very good. There isn't a weak spot in the cast. The psychopathic killer is a personal favorite. Try to find all the Hitchcock film references. This movie won't disappoint."
"Positive","Titanic story interpreted through a 1950s lens...: This is an excellent movie that I vaguely remembered seeing on TV years and years ago. I just saw it the other night on TMC. It's actually pretty good and it's obvious that the much of the modern-day ""Titanic"" (1997?) was based on this earlier movie. Some of the scenes are recreated almost word-for-word. There is no ""Jack and Rose"", however, there is a young couple who insist on going down in the ship together. It's also very interesting to see the Titanic story interpreted through a 1950s lens as opposed to a 1990s lens. The 50s version places more emphasis on religiousity; the 90s version places more emphasis on hedonism."
"Negative","answering the '7 Seconds' question: I am a Wesley Snipes fan, and not all that hard to please, but I must agree with previous reviewer - EAGAN, MN - that this is a lame movie and one I have no desire to ever see again. To answer the question about where the title came from, the timers on the phony explosive charges Snipe's gang uses on the first three armored cars, to get the more complicated robbery in motion, were set at 7 seconds. Just why this inconsequential fact deserves to be the title remains a mystery to me."
"Negative","A Real Stinker: We had used a Poulan 18"" chainsaw for four years before it gave out, so we thought to stick with a brand we were comfortable with. However, we got the chainsaw yesterday, my husband went out to use it today, and it does nothing but stall out. It will not keep working, although it is just out of the box and my husband is experienced with using chainsaws. He called the 800 number listed on the instruction booklet and got a series of recordings that eventually told him that he will have to take it in to a service center to have it appraised to see whether they will deign to repair it or not. This is a major inconvenience to us as we will have to travel 40 miles just to have someone look it over. After this miserable performance, we will never buy another Poulan again. I would recommend that anyone looking for a chainsaw look elsewhere."
"Negative","not enough coverage: I had one of these coleman 10x10. The fly does not cover all the mesh. I moved it around and around and still could see out of it. I did not have the tent out in rain or dust thankfully. I returned it to coleman. They were very nice about it and refunded purchase price with copy of the sales receipt. I'm still looking for another tent. I don't need all that room, and I definitely will look for better fly coverage."
"Negative","one large flaw!: This product has a major flaw. It does not keep time. The time of day clock gains about an hour every 12 hours or so. I have to keep changing the time so that I water at the proper time."
"Positive","Review: Hermeneutics by Virkler and Ayayo: This is an extremely helpful work on the topic. It is both scholarly and friendly to the reader. The author takes a position while at the same time objectively presenting opposing views. Exercises are included for the reader as well as the teacher who wants to get the class involved. An instructor's companion CD is available through Baker Academic which is extremely valuable if you plan to teach from the text.In short, this book has become a treasure in my library and I am grateful to Henry Virkler and Karelynne Gerber Ayayo for writing it (and revising it - 2nd edition). Thank you both."
"Positive","Great product: My husband and I each have a trainer and we think they are great. They do need a bit of tweaking to get them just right and you can't coast but they still make for a great work out. Some mornings are too cold and too dark to ride outside and I find the trainer to be a great safe alternative. This product is our first trainer and I doubt we will be needed another."
"Positive","The music here is sweet!: 98 Degrees and Stevie Wonder show their abilities here. So does Donny O. But I think the ochestra steals the show on this CD."
"Negative","Bizarre, to say the least: Ok, you have got to be kidding me. I was plodding along, trying to enjoy the story and the plot, when all of a sudden in the end of chapter 16 (?) Dirk and his friends are rescued by someone named Clive Cussler?!?! No way! I have never read a book of fiction where the author creates a character called himself. Is this typical of best sellers? Did you ever see any of the great writers do this? Hemingway, Steinbeck? I'm going to put this one aside and try Fire Ice, but that's it. I'll probably never read another Cussler novel again. Give me Shaara any day. (And I even had one of Shaara's in my hands at the library, but decided against another Civil War book--too bad. I'm sure I'd still be reading that one.)"
"Positive","This completes the Kindle ""Nuala Ann"" Collection!: I originally had to buy ""Irish Lace"" in a print edition because it was the one Greeley novel missing from the Kindle collection of ""Nuala Ann"" stories. I'm glad that the omission of this second novel in the series was finally corrected. It carries on from Nuala's arrival in Chicago at the end of ""Irish Gold"" until her engagement to Dermot Coyne prior to ""Irish Whiskey"". It's nice to have all twelve novels in the series available on my Kindle."
"Positive","Prime Times 2d ed. A Handbook for Excellence in Infant and Toddler Programs: The book was as described if not better. It arrived quickly. Would buy from them again. Great price for students!"
"Positive","Good Rock And Roll Band Here: I have liked Guiffria since they first came out in 1984 with this album. Unfortunately they only put out two or three albums and disappeared. In the mid 1980's when rock music was going to pot, Guiffria came through with some good old hard rock to keep the trend going. Bordering on hard rock and metal, this album was superb back then and it is just as fresh today as it was then. With the garbage they call music today, we need more bands like Guiffria and more hard rocking albums like this self-titled album. If you like good rock and roll, and hard rock at that, this is the album to have in your collection."
"Positive","If we could be with you one hour tonight ,live at the Club.: If one wanted proof that Art Tatum was the greatest (and I for one don't) this album would be Exhibit A. Tatum sits down at the keyboard before an enthusiastic audience at the Crescendo Club, and the excitement begins.From the first bars his genius is proclaimed. Song after song of creative improvisation flows from his fingertips. He is endlessly inventive in his unique melodic style,never repeating an idea or phrase from beginning to end.This recording illustrates that what was impossible for other pianists was effortless for Tatum,even in a live performance.Listening to masterpiece follow masterpiece, one has the impression that Art could continue improvising all night,weaving his polyphonic magic in a succession of brilliancies. My only complaint is that the date of the recording is not given.From the focused and comtemplative style, I would guess the early 50's."
"Positive","Quality melodic hard rock: I don't know that New York band Wild Horses (not to be confused with the UK band of the same name) qualifies as an all-star group, since Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson is the only immediately recognizable member, but they are a pretty decent melodic hard rock band.The band's 1991 album Bareback, until recently their only release, is equal parts Warrant and Cinderella. It is fairly straightforward hard rock music, with some hair metal and Southern rock elements added to the mix. The musicianship is top notch, and former Shout vocalist John Levesque gives a very solid performance. Closing the album with a cover of Stevie Wonder's ""Tell Me Something Good"" was a nice touch, and not what you'd expect from a band in this genre.While I wouldn't call Bareback a must-have album, it is still well worth checking out if you're a fan of this kind of music."
"Positive","Valentine sweet: MY wife is definitely not a chocohalic and is not fond of most sweets. In fact Werther's is the only candy she really likes. So instead of chocolates or flowers I bought this monster box of Werther's for Valentines day. It was a big hit."
"Negative","Snort of Derision: I read this book several months ago, and I was so annoyed with the author's manipulative style. After Shreve's RESISTANCE and THE WEIGHT OF WATER, I was expecting something much better, so I'm very disappointed that Oprah chose this."
"Positive","Gardens Illustrated Review: From the Feb. 2002 issue of Gardens Illustrated magazine:""...the book is a compelling and beautifully written discussion on contemporary landscape design. A book about any other field of design would probably not include the rather self-conscious word ""radical"" in the title, but its use here is indicative of the generally reactionary nature of most open space design... there are a few valient souls out there trying to change this state of affairs, and this book chronicles some of the best...Amidon writes, 'Among the creators of radical landscapes it is difficult to find common threads,' but her strategy is broadly successful in organizing this diverse selection of landscape designers and their work."""
"Negative","Matrix?: After Christmas I purchased several DVDs in an effort to add variety to my walking routines. Of the DVDs I purchased, this is my least favorite. I found the matrix thing gimmicky, and ineffective. Perhaps I am just a klutz, but also found that many of the ""steps"" were impossible to do and added nothing to the workout. The background was beautiful, at least at first, and the people in the DVD were too. They seemed to have no problem with the steps, but that did not help me. There were other ""gimmicks"" with the background, such as putting it on a billboard, side of a train, etc. As you can tell, I got distracted by elements of the DVD which did not add to the effectiveness of the workout. I do not use this one and feel it was a waste of money. Nice location and hat."
"Positive","Excellent Animation!: I first watched this movie in a moviehouse and I was absolutely amazed on how it was done. When the DVD version came out, I just had to buy it 'coz I thought it was worth watching over and over. I was right! The movie appeared better on DVD - all the vivid colors, detailed artwork on characters, etc. My family has watched it more than we could ever imagine!"
"Negative","R.E. the Book---WHY?: When I first saw the book I thought it would be a new perspective on the events at the mansion, maybe from a new character or two (a couple hikers) that entered the mansion the day before. Instead, we are taken through the same story-line as the video game, which came across as a little redundant. Perry relies too much on the idea that the reader has already played the game, and expects the reader to know the enviroment and mood of the book. She does not do a good job of describing the mansion, or the origin of the creatures. I would have liked a story of the mansion itself before its downfall. The idea of what went on in the building and how it became over-run sounds more interesting then reliving the video game scene by scene. But, it is the only R.E. book out there, so I will suggest you read it based soley on that. But, again, it follows the game so closely that you can always predict what happens in the next paragraph."
"Positive","Glory feild: This book is about a family that and their existance through the years. This book starts out durring slavery times, at the top of the family tree. Then thestory works it's way down to modern times. I liked this book because can see slavery and how it affected their whole life...."
"Positive","Great Resource: Every Day Life During The Civil War provides an excellent introduction to the realities of daily life during the Civil War era. The volume is filled to the brim with facts and figures and is an enjoyable read to boot. Mr. Varholla also provides a comprehensive index as well as a useful set of ""further information"" references. Highly recommend this one."
"Negative","Need a sorbet to cleanse my palate: If you are into self-indulgent narcissism, this is the book for you. I'm only half way through, and I already feel nauseous from being force-fed one family's over the top ego. There isn't a chapter where I didn't say to myself ""yuck"". I'm only finishing the book to try to better understand the person who recommended this book as a wonderful read."
"Negative","Junk -- and no support.: Three gripes:1) It broke after 2 weeks. The left channel doesn't transmit. It is a transmitter issue, as I've tried replacing the cable.2) The tech support / warranty response was non-existent. I emailed the support contact on the web site and no response. Emailed them again and still no response.3) Major issue for me, but likely not for most people -- there is a delay in the signal broadcast. I wanted to use these headphones to play my guitar, but I hear the sound coming through at a 1 second delay, so it is impossible to play real time."
"Positive","Inspiring: Mary Bridget is a likable character right away. A good girl who falls on the wrong side of the law & realizes her mistakes she tries to make things right. This book truly touched my heart & I'm sure it will touch yours as well. You will find yourself rooting for Mary Bridget(Birdie) as she tries to find out who she really is. You'll really fall in love with her as she helps mend a broken family by stepping into an unexpected roll of a nanny. It also reminds us of how God answers our questions without us realizing it. I would like to thank Bethany House for allowing me to review this book."
"Positive","Best suspense thriller novel EVER!!: I read David Baldacci's books Total Control and Absolute Power which were terrific, well written and very suspenseful. I have never read a book as fantastic as The Winner. It is the very best book I have ever read - of any category. I couldn't put it down. I referred it to several friends who read it overnite! I cannot properly describe this book to give it the justice it deserves. The story is far fetched but at the same time, the way Baldacci writes it, seems and very possibly could be extremely real. I recommend that everyone read this book!! In fact, I wish I could read it, then forget what it was about so I could read it over and over again."
"Negative","Trex climbing background: It looked nothing like the background pictured for the ad.Looks cheaply made to boot!I was expecting a foam background with climbing cutouts but got flat coconut fiber instead!"
"Positive","A Great Collection of Oldies -Plus!: Ringo Starr began his legendary ""All-Starr Tour"" with this collection. It encompasses a great group of individuals that have done enormously well in the past and continue the legacy with these songs - backing eachother all the way. Levon Helms holds the best with ""The Weight"", Joe Walsh sets forth with ""Life In The Fast Lane"" and Nils Lofgren does beautfully with his always 'live' version of ""Shine Silently"". Ringo, of course has his staples here as well. If this doesn't sound good enough, consider buying the ""Anthology"" collection with three discs (this one included) that comprise the rest of three concerts and dozens more of guest stars."
"Positive","the choice is american leadership or a new dark age: This book should be required reading. It shows every Americanthe realities behind the war on terrorism and the true largerconflict between God focused American ideals and the new darkage of savagery which is its only alternative.America is the only leader of the free world. It is theobligation of America to extend the borders of freedom to theentire globe and to banish the evil ones from the face of theearth. Iraq was the start. But it can't be the end.If Kaplan has a problem, its that he uses too much flowerylanguage and too many obsecure references. He needs to speakto the ordinary american because its the ordinary American whois going to solve this problem. The weak liberal intellectualssipping their wine are the problem. Playing their game andtrying to convince them is a waste of time. Real Americanswant to see the problem presented clearly and told what thesolution is. The rest is a waste of time."
"Negative","HOW ABOUT SOMETHING FRESH AND NEW??????: I own all of Reba's CDs. Some are better than others. But this collection contains nothing fresh and new...not even the two new songs.....all are done in Reba's same ""pop"" style that she's been singing for years now. Its time for her to go back to singing traditional 3 chord, steel and fiddle country. That is what she does best. No one can do it like her. There's nothing distinctive about Reba anymore and for her to go back to traditional country music would be refreshing!"
"Negative","Returned it: This product may be useful for some, but it wasn't for me. I have distinctive ring and caller ID on my line, and called the manufacturer before ordering to ask whether it would work in that configuration. They said yes. But in reality it only works partially - with most phones, the caller ID shows up for a second or so, and then disappears again, because the box actually picks up the phone to listen for fax tones. This is unnecessary with distinctive ring, and causes the caller to be billed even though he only hears a ringtone. I sent it back the same day I received it."
"Negative","No Pressure: I purchased this product in order to use it outdoors with a canning pressure cooker. This product has a shutoff control that must be built into the circuitry. Every time the cooker would start to boil this, product would shut itself off. It is of no use to me at all."
"Positive","Coffee Table Book: This is a great book for the coffee table. It has lots of beautiful color pictures with a brief history of the artist and the piece in the photo but if you are looking for ideas with detailed information on how to color metal using mediums other than paint, don't waste your time or money."
"Negative","For the very young: Wish this had a much better close up view so I could have seen it in more detail before I bought it. Took a chance and regret it - this is probably useful for 5 and under. After that, you have to get a real map."
"Positive","stay clear of this slugish model C- - -: SORT OF A GOOD PRODUCT BUT SLOW RESPONCE REMOTE & UNIT...I SENT IT BACK AND ORDERED A SONY 5 DISC...ITS GREAT AND AN UPCONVERTER ALSO 1080i cool"
"Positive","A GREAT CD!!! A MUST BUY!!!: Virtue's first cd was a very good cd It was one of those cd's you could let play and sit back and enjoy. Get ready!!is even more enjoyable!! The songs ""Put your war clothes on"","" Super Victorious"" and ""Don't take your joy away"" are da bomb. Every song on the album will have you singing praises to God!!!"
"Positive","Excelente: Me encantó este video, este fue un concierto espectacular...Soy admiradora de Michael Jackson y no hay palabras que describieran su talento ni su calidad humana. No habrá otro igual que el. RIP."
"Positive","Almost perfect: I got this watch to replace a Timex Sports Watch. I have been through two Timex watches that claimed to be water ""resistant"" to 100 m, but both crapped out swimming on the surface of a pool. So far, the Casio remains water tight. The radio controlled time reset function didn't work at first, but after about three days it started working and has worked ever since. My only complaint is the stiffness of the buttons. It is especially frustrating with the stopwatch function as I actually use it. Because the buttons are recessed, I have to use a pen to press the buttons and their stiffness compromises the accuracy of what I'm timing."
"Negative","Boring: 4 races into this game and I was bored, I did not feel like playing it anymore. Free roam is missing where I could have gone an be lawless for a bit until I felt like playing again. Customization is great best of the series to me but that's the only good thing it has going for it."
"Negative","LAME: Don't buy this game. You can't save except at checkpoints, so when you are killed, you have to play through almost the whole thing again just to get back to where you were. Even a head shot with an M1 Garand does not drop the enemy, COME ON!!!! The enemy soldiers have superhuman reflexes and can duck as soon as you pull the trigger. This game is boring and you feel like you are fighting with a pea shooter for all damage you can do to your enemy. First person shooters need to find another war to fight, (Korea would be cool) We have won World War Two too many times now."
"Positive","best: i love this cat box! it keeps everything covered and smelling fresh with the charcoal filter. however, my only problem with this is that the liner keeps coming out of the one clasp after my cat uses it so i have to continue to adjust it every now and again. overall though, i am highly satisfied with my purchase!"
"Negative","Awful service: Company will not answer e-mails about failed products or honor warrenty. Very poor customer service"
"Negative","Felt it went nowhere...: Just finished reading it and felt I had wasted my time. I felt it kind of rambled back and forth, back and forth and went nowhere."
"Positive","I Liked this a lot: I thought this was done very tastefull, the other guests showed him some respect by not trying to out preform him and stayed somewhat back just enough to let him be Roy, it was a great tribute to him and I really enjoyed it, brought back some good memories. Good to see Jennifer Warnes in there. Doug"
"Negative","Low point in the series... so far.: I know, I know, Clan of the Cave Bear was fantastic, and Auel is a great writer... BUT, this book nearly ended the series for me. I simply could not believe how trashy and juvenile the plot was: a prehistoric love triangle... how exciting. And whatever happened to Ayla's strong, independent nature? Watching her chasing along behind the jerky Jondalar literally made my skin crawl. I wished I'd skipped this book and gone right to the next which was, thankfully, a little better."
"Negative","Not the real McCoy: At best this is novice level. To claim that the puzzles ""will provide a sly, absorbing test for even the best most proficient experts"" is misleading in the extreme. I would rate myself as ""Competent"" and yet have not been challenged by any of the puzzles so far. I am only up to puzzle number 26, so maybe the challenges are yet to come.Black Belt Sudoku (Martial Arts Sudoku)"
"Positive","Took a while to get into it but glad I stuck with it: I had a really time getting interested in this book. I wasn't a big fan of the character, Harriet (Jen's mom), and wasn't looking forward to reading too much more about her and her interactions with Jen. Luckily Harriet was not in all that many scenes in the book.Once I got going with the book I enjoyed it. I found most all the characters likeable. I didn't necessarily feel like I got to Jen all that much but there was enough to work with and relate to.The book picked up and I sat down and read straight through the last 80 pages. I would recommend it."
"Positive","Great family film: This is a good film for the whole family. Enough fun adventures for the kids and some funny cameo appearances that the grown-ups will enjoy."
"Positive","the best thus far: This is the best shampoo for my puppies that I have used thus far. My vet switched to a different one, and it couldn't hold a candle to this one, so I had to buy it online. I know my boston terriers appreciated that!"
"Positive","Greenies: Stopped being able to find large quantities locally so glad that Amazon has vendors who are selling them at a great price."
"Positive","This book is good and funy.: This book is good for your reading.Also I liked this book because is sad.Because the kid lose his parents.For me this book is nice and good for my reading."
"Positive","Outstandingly written and meticulously researched: I'll be honest. I'm the toughest of critics. It's hard to impress a professional writer, amateur historian, former English teacher, and all around pirate enthusiast. This book is truly outstanding in the field of historical non-fiction. It delivers not only an engaging writing style but also the thorough historical research. I'm not convinced I needed to know down to the last barrel the cargo of each ship Kidd and his men took as prizes, but if you want that level of detail this book provides it along with a ripping narrative that tells the story so important when writing history. Enjoyed every page. Wish all pirate books were this well done.Five stars, well deserved!!!"
"Negative","Cheap Sunglasses: Cheap, yes. You get what you pay for. They look better in the picture. Thin lens, thin frame, loose plastic sides."
"Positive","Outstanding: I rarely get sucked into a book the way I did by this one. Congradulations Robert Ferrigno, this is an absulote page turner. Good character development with many twists and turns to the storyline. This book is exactly what a mystery should be, believable and hard core content.Thank you"
"Negative","Horrible hack stuff: This is the worst of fantasy writing. I wish it had remained in the fantasy world."
"Positive","A Must Have....: This is a great book! It is easy to reference and easy to read. I use it all the time with questions I have about my kids sleep, diet, discipline, illness.... If you have a toddler, buy this book!"
"Positive","Creflo Dollar- No More Debt: If you really want to learn the principle of getting out of debt and staying out, then you should read this book and apply to your life. The steps to erase your debt are as if God spoke them to Creflo Dollar himself..."
"Positive","Get ready for real rock!: This is my second typing. These guys will put you back in your seat with many styles of pure rock. Myles has his own but is reminiscent of early SoundGarden's Cris Cornell. Some of the songs' endings are like what a real first record band should sound like, however, you can tell how much energy these guys have in this album. I pass by ""the"" Alter Bridge quit a bit, and have to say, with each passing, it defintely grows on you. If you're looking for Creed, these guys have come to make them history and start what a true rock band is supposed to be."
"Negative","Misleading Description: Ad states Repti Glo 10.0 but I received a 8.0. Looking at the other reviews I notice it is not a new problem, the vendor just choose to ignore the wrong description. Returned"
"Positive","Amazing Game...too easy: This is a truly amazing game. Its graphics are far better than either Myst or Riven. Worth buying just for the beauty of the graphics and the sound. The only drawback was that it was far too easy. Two days of playing and I was done with the game, and there is practically no repeatability."
"Negative","Dropped After One Year: We adopted this book because several of our neighboring colleges use the text. After using the book I am stunned that any college continues to use it. Our department never had so many complaints from students. We almost always suffer through a text for the full 4-year adoption period. This text was so bad that we dropped it after one year."
"Negative","This table = an ER visit for us!!!: We purchased this table for $14.99 FULLY reading the other reviews so our hopes were not extremely high. BUT I figured for the price and a little help from a little wood glue we would be able to use the table for awhile! NOT EVEN!! We assembled the table and the next morning my 22 pound 2 year old sat on one of the seats and it collapsed right under him. While he was falling to the ground (which isn't a very far fall...its pretty low to the ground, that wasn't the issue) a VERY sharp wood screw protruded out and gouged a three inch gash out of his tiny little leg. We cleaned it up and came to the conclusion it was deep enough for a visit to the ER. Now the table is sitting completely broken out on our deck, just waiting for the recycling truck. My issue is not the money paid...its the safety of this table. It needs to be taken off Amazon and Becks Internation needs to upgrade their quiality control. SO DISAPPOINTED!"
"Positive","Awesome Dog Toy: My westie loves these toys and for her they last a long time. I would recommend them to any one no matter what type of dog they have."
"Positive","Works well: This is a very good ice crusher for home use. The only negative is that it is really loud. Quality of product is very good for the price."
"Positive","Mens Stringer Tank Top by Pitbull: dig my new stringer Pitbull. These have gone out of fashion but for us old school bodybuilders these are the greatest style for lifting. nothing beats the full range of motion and that nearly shirtless feeling they give you in a public gym. I may have to order another one in another color I love this one thank you."
"Negative","The power supply died after one year: This wine cooler worked okay for a while. The temperature went up after a few months, but that was easily fixed by cleaning the dust out of the filter on the back. Unfortunately, this week the power supply died, and now the cooler doesn't work anymore. It only makes clicking noises when plugged in. I'm not sure if I should buy a new power supply from Vinotemp because this problem seems to be quite common."
"Positive","Definitely helped me!: I loved this book! It really opened my eyes and got me thinking about life and death. Made me appreciate the short time we all have on this earth. Also took away some fears I had about death."
"Negative","Too Much Yelling & Arguing: There is just way too much fighting and arguing in this movie. It had such potential."
"Positive","Pretty Funny Satire: This book is a good satire of our society and its mores. Written nearly 30 years ago, it still applies to American culture today. Unlike most of his political works where he blends semi-funny jokes with right-wing ideology, in this book P.J. O'Rourke generally leaves politics alone to focus on ridiculing every aspect of modern American culture: from the drugs we take, to our sexual morals, to the insipid youth culture, and on and on. His main point, from what I can tell, is that in modern America, we've all become self-absorbed bastards. He may be on to something."
"Positive","An amazing epic: This story is just so much more gripping than the majority of other stories of our time. It developd characters and explains them at a natural pace and lets you get familiar with them by putting them through many tests that also help the characters learn about themselves. The storyline is deep and it just grabs you and is exteremely well done. But, you'd think that a story as old as this one would be a difficult one to read and yet it is written so well that anyone can understand it, and the descriptions are just amazing as well. A great story to read."
"Negative","The REAL reason they're thin....: French women smoke (as do most European women).THAT'S why they're thin.Don't waste your money."
"Positive","A concise, objective account of the Crimean War.: If you are interested in learning about the Crimean War, this is a good volume to start with. Includes 16 illustrations (drawings and photographs), 11 maps, the Orders of Battle for British, French and Russian forces. Lists British Cavalry and Infantry regiments invovled. A chronological table is given, starting March 2, 1853 and ending April 27, 1856. Events leading to the war are given first. Background on the war on the Danube, in Asia Minor and in the Baltic are provided. Balaclava, Inkerman and Sevastopol are detailed. Administrative difficulties are discussed and the Naval campaigns in the Baltic, the White Sea and the North Pacific are covered. I found the volume very easy to read and most enjoyable."
"Negative","HAVE TO AGREE: I have to agree with the previous reviewer. When I started looking down the track listing, I realized I bought this for three cuts (""Love Will Tear Us Apart"", ""Vienna"", and ""Danger"") probobly one of the weaker complations in the series."
"Negative","Couldn't Finish: I know many people won't review a book they never finished, because it's ""unfair to the author."" I'm not one of those. Because, I feel if I can't finish the book, that's a direct reflection on the horrible job the author has done. The book didn't engage me, didn't keep me turning the pages. I think it's completely fair to judge a book based on the fact that I COULD put it down, and did. I can usually finish a book in a day or two. This one, after over a WEEK, I was still only halfway through. Therefore, this book got one star from me. Confusing, formulaic, boring, repetitive, and devoid of any emotion whatsoever. It's a shame, really, because I was really looking forward to liking this series. As it is, I can't imagine finishing this one, much less reading any of the others."
"Negative","What a Rip-Off!: The premise of this book looked really fun, and I enjoy reading about 30 somethings struggling with dating, etc.. I started reading and finished within minutes! I started again, making different choices, and also finishing within minutes. The idea is cute, but I would much rather sink myself into a nice, long, detailed story."
"Negative","Be carefull, your Ipod will DIE: I got this Transmitter because I had trust this brand (Griffin), but as soon as I connected it to my ipod and then to my car, my Ipod turn off and then die, the transmitter burned my Ipod and I am really pissed off, I found this product cheap and It had a good review buy users should be more carefull because It will kill your Ipod and surely you will not get any warranty, this transmitter in the end is a [...] buck transmitter.PLEASE DONT BUY!!"
"Negative","I like Hockney but not this book: well my review title says it all (although Amazon won't let me stop there).I do like Hockney in general even though he is a much more cerebral artist than I prefer.I did not read the story behind each painting/drawing because that's not what I'm interested in. But if one must read about a painting to enjoy it then somethings missing.The only work I really enjoyed was #100 of his mum. The drawings seemed much stronger than the paintings (to me) and some I've liked in the past seemed missing from this book (or maybe I'm imagining that).I know it's not my place to tell Mr. Hockney to let go and get a little emotional but that's what I feel looking at the portraits. Restrained, inhibited, arms length, surface not depth."
"Negative","Change for the worse: The service is getting worse. The What Do You Think? segment is not working, missing most of article. Also now shows audio and video links which obviously don't work on a Kindle. Too bad, I've always enjoyed The Onion and hope they realize that they should tailor this to the Kindle's strengths."
"Negative","Not so great: I should have judged by the title. What settled for this because there were no others on the market. I wanted big air and amazing footage, and there isn't much."
"Positive","Buy this book!: This book has everything you need to get to Moab, pick a trail that is right for you and have a great time. There are overall technical ratings for each trail, individual technical ratings for each part of every trail, elevation maps, detailed overhead maps, instructions for particularly troublesome areas...it is all here. Someone said that it would not fit in a Camelbak, but it easily fits in one of the smaller pockets of my MULE. When I'm there next week, it will definitely not be left back at camp, but will be with me on every mile of slickrock that I ride. Do not buy Lee Bridgers' book! This one is less expensive, of higher quality and you can take it with you wherever you go."
"Positive","Exactly What I Wanted: I was looking for a wall mount just to put my LCD up on the wall so I can have more desk space, and this one is perfect. Too many other ones are too fancy and more than what I need. I like this because it hangs almost directly on the wall, so you're not using up valuable real estate. Additionally, it only requires one screw into the wall to set up, which is much better than having to drill multiple holes like with other designs. My initial concern was that it wouldn't be steady, but as it is, it is surprisingly firm and there's no movement at all. Very clever design and perfect for my needs."
"Negative","Excellent idea, poor implementation. Not good.: The fingering chart inside of my book is far superior to this fold out. It is difficult to see whether you are going to use the Thumb or pinky keys with this chart, as they are not displayed! This is pitiful. My daughter who plays in the Symphony even remarked that this is a very poor fingering chart for beginners."
"Positive","really good cd: this cd is worth it for the songs ""Always"" and ""Be Real"" alone. I was lucky enough to see Jonah play ""Be Real"" live and on a video (2 of the 3 times he played it live before this ep came out) and adored that song. The version on the CD is great with the Rival School guys playing as it fleshes out the song and has a great loose jazz feel (though the silly guitar lead in the chorus should not be there). The other Jonah written song is ""Always"" and theis songs an amazing bombastic performance by the band (one of the heaviest onelindrawing songs), and it's also an amazing song. It's little similar ""Wings"" from the Sensefield split.The first track is a short pseudo-instrumental, and the other 3 are Rival Schools songs with Walter singing. These songs are pretty cool but all are sort of generic beatles-esque indie orkc and get boring. the songs i've heard from United by Fate are better."
"Positive","Western fan.: Hard not to like this packet if you like westerns.Even being B/W the picture was good.I did have to repeat a few times to get the wordsas sound went down but never so bad couldn't hear.Like most westerns don't always need the sound,the action tells all."
"Positive","The Coolest Card Game Ever: This is really the coolest card game ever. I play against kids at school, my dad, and even kids I just meet. The more kids I play with the more freinds I make. The cards themselfes are also really cool 'cause they have amazing artwork and cool desines. Playing the game is so fun, and I think that other kids should drop dumb games like ""Yu gi oh"" and ""pokymen""(I'm suprised that theres kids that even collect those any more!?). This is both a family and a freind game, and I love it!!... {=)"
"Positive","I LOVE LOVE TITANIC I COULD DIE I DON'T SEE IT.: LEONARDO YOU ARE SO LUCKY YOU GOT TO BE IN TITANIC O AND YOU TO KATE. Did Kate stayed loving you leonardo cause I do. I LOVE TITANIC BUT NOT MORE THEN YOU LEONARDO"
"Positive","Last great AC/DC album: AC/DC was kind of stuck in 1990, after the just average albums FLY ON THE WALL and BLOW UP YOUR VIDEO. So, they hired late famous producer Bruce Fairbairn, went to Canada and recorded their last great album.THE RAZOR's EDGE is strong,has a crisp sound, drummer Chris Slade has a firm beat, and features twelve songs that, even all of them possessing the trademark AC/DC sound, has its own feel and difference between them.For the first time, Angus and Malcolm shares the credits for themselves, without Brian Johnson.As for this special package, it's ok, but the lyrics are missing, as in all of the albums of the special edition."
"Negative","Disappointment: I am a HUGE Dave Matthews Band Fan and believe Boyd Tinsley is an outstanding violin player. Therefore, I was very excited to learn about his new cd 'True Reflections.'The CD has only a few violin solos. In addition Boyd had the same voice and rhythm in 90% of the songs. It was a waste of time and money. I could not even listen to the whole CD; it made me sick."
"Positive","The Ataris the way they were meant to sound: Forget So Long Astoria. This is how The Ataris should be heard. These 6 songs pack emotion into pop-punk (but it's not emo - that's an important distinction) and come off sounding like a combination of the Descendents and the Smoking Popes. They avoid the emo trap they would later fall into by packing these songs with equal doses of emotion and humor. ""My So-Called Life"" is a tribute to an actress on the TV show of the same name, and the classic ""San Dimas High School Football Rules"" takes its name from Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. Even though it's only an E.P, Look Forward To Failure is a quintessential Ataris record."
"Negative","HP 970Cse prints SLOW: We have an HP 970Cse for the last few years and have tried everything under the sun to get it to printer more clearly and faster, and nothing has worked, including this cartridge. We replaced the 970Cse with an Epson Stylus C84 and are 100% happier."
"Negative","It developed a run...: I've had this filter for 4 months and it started developing a run that is slowly widening and spreading all the way across. I think these things may be fragile by nature since they look like pantyhose material."
"Positive","Great for a litte pain relief: I have tried the spray & the roll-on of Bio-Freeze and the gel seems to work the quickest and the best. My chiropractor handed me a few packs one day when I had a major adjustment and I couldn't believe how fast I felt the relief in my joints. I now carry a few in my first aid kit when I go kayaking or fishing in case it becomes a long day of too much fun."
"Positive","great little purse: This is a fabulous little purse and is perfect for the busy woman on the go. You can carry your phone, cash, and credit cards all in one handy place. It's durable and I highly recommend it if you're looking for something that you can toss in your purse or for those times when you just need to go ""minimal""."
"Negative","Jennie: Not impressed. I see value only as a collectible if one is building a library of Broadway musicals. In full context on stage it might have more appeal."
"Negative","NOT RETURNABLE: the quality is so low and you cant return itThat's ridiculousThe smell is so soSo its not a great dealbut still doubt if it is a fake one or not"
"Negative","If you feel you must read this, borrow DON'T BUY: This was among one the most absolutly horrible books I have ever read. The author was in way over her head. The story seemed to have no real focus and there were several points when I was just plain lost. The characters were unreal and stale.I hope that Ms. Mitchell has kept her ""day job""."
"Positive","ON BORROWED TIME: One of the greatest movies ever........ every review I've read is 4 and 5 star positive...... THEN WHY THE HECK ISN'T IT ON DVD YET????????"
"Negative","Piece of junk.: This is the worst, cheapest piece of crap ""coffee maker"" I have ever owned. Received it for a gift this Christmas and hopefully can take it back. Water runs all over the place down the sides when brewing. Took forever to brew and if you lift the lid to look you could get squirted in the face with scalding hot water. It shoots right up from the back and if the lid isn't down, WATCH OUT. Worst design ever.I would give it ZERO stars!!!!"
"Positive","Appearex: When I first started using Appearex about 2 years ago, it did wonders for my nails. More recently, it seems to have lost its effectiveness. I will continue to use it for a while to see if that changes. If it doesn't I'll discontinue."
"Positive","Good LCD monitor for a Great price!: I bought my 171v lcd monitor about 1 month ago. Has worked perfectly so far. I just took it out of the box, plugged it into my computer, power, turned it on and that was it. Did not have to install any drivers, even though there is a software CD included. The CD contains drivers and a Natural Color software, I don't like to install things unless needed, so did not even bother to try.The monitor costed me 5 hundred less a 1 hundred mail-in-rebate from Samsung (found about that in Samsung's website). So the monitor ended up costing 4 hundred bucks! Brand new. I got it from Comp--USA."
"Positive","Cool Chillow means a cool head: I really like the Chillow. Using it ended my constant turning of thepillow to find a cool spot."
"Positive","Absolutely Splendid: I would recommend this book to anyone who loves animals. the wonderful Daine is a splendid character that can relate to almost any teenager who has a passion for animals. Tamora has created yet another legend in Tortall - who, hopefully, will not be the last - she has included all great characters like the Lioness, King Johnathon, Queen Thayet, and of course, George- the King of Theives. This story is uplifting and full of adventure and excitment. If you start reading this book, you will get hooked, I garuntee it! In my opinion, the Immortals series is the best of Tamora's pieces..though the Lioness Quartet was very original, this series has a more modern feel and shows her love of animals. So, if you are considering reading this book then I urge you to hurry up and order it! Don't hesitate, this book is worth it- you will see....."
"Negative","This item is crap.: This item is complete crap. After following all the directions by the letter for a very small tear in my black leather car, it looked worse after the 'fix' than it did before. The black was lighter than my car interior and looked horrendous after its application. I even tried using some black shoe polish to darken the spot up a little but nothing worked. Eventually I just scrubbed the area with some cleaning wipes until most of the product was removed and almost restored to the condition it was in before using the leather repair kit. Don't waste your time or money, you won't be fooling anyone. In fact, you will only draw more attention to the spot."
"Positive","just to have it: I only bought this because i just needed with leaf green. It has the pokemon leafgreen does not. Other than that it, like leafgreen, is pretty solid good game. I would recomand to youngsters."
"Positive","Thank God!! Its About Time: I didn't think they would ever release any more seasons. I am so happy, this show taught me alot. I pray they come out with the rest of the seasons!PS: Rest In Peace John Dye (Andrew). What a Loss,you were a wonderful actor no-one could have been Andrew but you. You had such a kind soul and died way too young. You are Greatly Missed! Fly with the Angels!PSS: Does anyone know if the spin off from Touched by An Angel ""The Promised Land"" will be released on DVD? I would love to have that show also."
"Negative","Cheap, that's for sure.: Bought this light for a 3 week trek in Norway. 2 days into my journey this light began to flicker and I had to bash it to get it to come back on. If I hung it in my tent for a little light and it hung motionless it was bright. It is bright but certainly cheap, do yourself a favor and spend a little more for something functional."
"Negative","Bleh: I was really hoping to enjoy this book. There was something just not right about it. The writing was OK -- I wouldn't call Tom Perrotta a genius. The plot was fairly predictable. The only thing that surprised me was when Todd didn't take the bar exam.This was another Da Vinci Code for me -- totally overhyped and not worth my time."
"Negative","Republicans: Save your money...: ...There are NO goat pictures in this book. Damn! Complete waste of a $1.99!!! :("
"Positive","Friendship triangles: Everyone has experienced the rejection, or supposed rejection of a best friend. Simon feels his friendship with Molly is overshadowed by her friendship with Hester, the new girl in the neighborhood. A very real problem for children is brought to life in this tale of a friendship triangle. Jahn-Clough's illustrations are bright and cheerful when the children are playing and having fun, but become dark and foreboding when Simon questions his friendship with Molly."
"Positive","D-Link Router: Excellent router; much easier to set up than LinkSYS; good range -- greatly improved my WiFi access throughout the house and outside"
"Negative","moon sand a waste of money: my daughter wanted this so badly!she begged and begged. we finally agreed,not knowing exactly how it was going to be. do not waste your money! buy some nice play sand for a sand box instead. add water. buy some molds and cookie cutters. or go to the beach for free! this stuff was a mess! most of it ended up in the trash. my 6 yr. old is neat,but this was all over her! i asked her if it was worth it to her and she said it was fun,but she has not asked to use it again."
"Positive","It works great, but ............: Great new product. I bought the Notebook version. Only problem is, when the receiver is plugged into a USB port, Windows screen saver will never kick in. Once you unplug the receiver, presto! - screensaver works.Other than that, it's a great little mouse for notebook use."
"Positive","Fun game, despite the wait.: My only complain was the waiting on the elevators. The NXE Game install kinda got rid of that but it was too late for me I was nearly done with the game already.Its a great game though, pick it up if you can."
"Positive","AHCC: Kinoko Gold is a superior immune enhancer. My husband, who has a blood cancer which reduces his white blood cell counts and depresses his immune fighting capabilities uses AHCC to boost his immune system. It has worked well and will continue to use during the course of his cancer fight."
"Negative","got my money back: I loved the look of this, but I had 2 different models that broke within weeks. After I shipped the 2nd one back to Speck they lost it and just refunded me the cash. A friend of mine had the same problem. Speck stopped producing them because they are great looking but don't last."
"Positive","My favorite puzzle bock!!: This book opens up a whole world of possibilities for puzzle enthusiasts! It does a systematic break down of the ideas behind the design of burr puzzles, puzzles whose assembled interlocking pieces form ployhedra. It contains the most amazing puzzles of this sort I've ever seen. If you love puzzles, you'll love this book!!"
"Positive","Wow!!!: Making the decision to read a fiction story along with a non-fiction book concurently my librarian suggested a Ann Rule Book. Well, I am a fan now. The only problem is the truth sometimes reads more like fiction than fiction itself. This man was truly a monster, to his family and society itself. If Lucifer is on earth he probably is in the body of Allen. I Will now begin my journey to read all of Ann Rules works, I am sure I will enjoy them all."
"Negative","Cuisinart DCC-2000 - no power: I have a daily battle with this machine every morning. Sometimes it won't start up, sometimes it will. I have to plug it in and out 25 times some mornings to get it to work. It also will just power off halfway through brewing. If you're like me, and need coffee in the mornings to get over the grumps...this machine will not help. Actually makes you more grumpy. I figured for the $99 price tag it would at least last a year or more.It's about to be tossed out with the trash so save your money.Cuisinart DCC-2000 Coffee-on-Demand 12-cup Programmable Coffeemaker"
"Positive","Delightful. Insightful. Poingnant & Cantankerous!: I loved this book, me!I grew up on that little island, barely 5 miles long and 4 miles wide, but a whole country unto itself! The place defies the physics of Geography! It's tiny, but it's vast too. Like the story of our friend Mr. Ebenezer Le Page, the simplicity of the lives of the inter connected characters, colourful and quirky, defies the closeness of the shores.GB Edwards' posthumous writings capture the essence of the folk and the place as well, possibly better, than any book about anybody, anywhere. I highly encourage anyone who reads this story to find out as much about Guernsey as possible, perhaps even go there (visit Victor Hugo's house), then read it again for the first time.Utterly enchanting! Haunting! Simply brilliant!"
"Negative","I don't usually write reviews.....: .......but this book was so insipid that I had to warn other readers. I read the whole thing and I'd really like those 3 hours of my life back. It aspires to be ""chick-lit"" on the level of the Sophie Kinsella books, or ""Something Borrowed"" by Emily Giffin, but it has more in common with the dreaded ""Red Dress Ink"" books which I think should be avoided at all costs. The narrator is unlikable and inconsistent and the plot meanders to a maddening degree. I think she has some talent that could be developed further but this book is not a promising debut."
"Positive","The Hatchet review: Hatchet is about a 13 year old boy named Brain. Brain's parents are divorced. Brain lives with his mom, one winter he went to see his dad. He lives in Canada so he had to fly over. Before he left,his mom gave him a hatchet because he was getting to be a young man.Then he was flying over and the pilot had a heart attack and died. Brain did't know how to fly so he went down into a lake.He survived by living in the woods. Then he made a radio and they found him. Hatchet is a great book for readers of all ages. More people should read this book."
"Negative","You're in the 21st century: I was going to buy ""Passionate Brood"" but the author's foreword left me cold. ""I'm going to write in present-day English, and I make no apology"". Well, that just shows she doesn't want to put forth a little extra effort. People in the 14th century may have had the same human feelings, but their attitudes and their speech were shaped by their time, their religion, and their rigid social class. Dialog helps get that across. Go ahead and read ""Passionate Brood"", but then read ANYthing written by Sharon Kay Penman......you will see the difference immediately."
"Positive","A many years street biker appreciation: After some 40 years of street motorcycling I found Keith's approach through survival reactions (SRs) objectively teaching and Doug Chandler's comments very true. I'm again learning to bike ride. To the author, I may simply say: thanks for the renewed fun I'm experiencing!"
"Negative","ok potty seat, wouldn't buy again: I agree with other comments regarding ""Noise"" being distracting. My son is 5 years old and still loves to use this potty WITHOUT it turned on! My biggest complaint is it is IMPOSSIBLE to keep all the little nooks and crannies clean and at this point I am ready to throw it in the trash as it stinks!!! The urine gets trapped around all the sensor parts and there are so many crevices that it's impossible to clean them thoroughly every time one of my 2 kids uses the potty! Not a good investment and would definitely not buy it again. My recommendation to anyone looking for a potty seat, KEEP IT SIMPLE!"
"Negative","Inscrutable: THE RELUCTANT ADMIRAL: YAMAMOTO AND THE IMPERIAL NAVY by Kiruyuki Agawa. A biography of Admiral Isuruku Yamamoto. Not a great book. Filled with interesting information but the Japanese are very funny about World War 2. On one hand, they cheer their glorious victories over the dim bulb Americans who apparently only won the War because of their greater industrial capacity and because they somehow cheated by breaking the Japanese codes. On the other hand apparently NOBODY in Japan wanted to go to war with the United States except a couple of guys who luckily did not survive the War. Apparently Imperial Japan was a peace loving country who somehow just bombed Pearl Harbor one day.Worth reading solely from a historical perspective but not a successful book otherwise."
"Negative","It is a touch thicker than a plastic bag from a grocery store: Ok yeah so it was cheap.. however.. it is something that would be in a dollar store for a dollar. At least they give you two of them. And the string is good quality. But the bag... wow.. it is very cheap quality plastic.. like the title of my review says, it is a little bit thicker than a grocery store's plastic bag. I recommend paying a little more and getting a rain cover that is of a thicker material and not a plastic bag like this.I gave it two stars because there were two bags in the package not just one and it is ok for a lightweight carry around bag, just in case you have your camera out and it starts raining."
"Negative","EQ2 Equalizer -- Register Booster: Yep, I gotta agree with the other reviewers that this is a waste of money. Great concept, poorly executed. It does turn on and off automatically, but that's it's only good point.I have an upstairs bedroom that gets about 5-6 degrees warmer than the rest of the house. Warmer even than the adjacent bedroom. Put one of these over the vent, checked the temperature all day, and there was no difference. I think most computer fans are probably quieter and blow more air. All this seems to do is churn the air around a bit.While I'm not a mechanical engineer, I think this product could have been designed better, without adding cost, and actually might have worked.Save your money. If you have a vent that's not vlowing much air, try removing the grill. The grill restricts the airflow and removing it might be enough to help."
"Positive","Makes a great counter!: I purchased this crate for my new Great Dane puppy, now 9 weeks old, Isis. The divider is really great for making the size of the crate ""grow"" with her. I put a blanket over the top and as Isis grows and learns her way around the house I have been sitting more and more stuff on top of the crate to keep things out of her reach. So far so good... I'm glad I went for the large crate.I checked prices locally and on-line and this purchase was the best way to go. I would recommend this crate to anyone with a large breed dog."
"Positive","Exelente producto: Buen producto lo recomiendo ampliamente, algunas tarjetas de video no traen el cable de alimentacion incluido y es necesario instalarselo"
"Positive","wonderful work displaying the joy, and pain of colored girl: shange uses the arts of poetry, music and dance to create a spectacular rainbow of beauty,sorrow , joy and pain brought to the reader in a sometimes funny , sometimes serious manner in ""laugh but don't laugh"" imagery she creates. it's a celebration of life, struggle and woman"
"Negative","Dead Battery: Everything went very smoothly for this purchase until the watch battery died the same day I rec'd the watch...now I have to get the battery replaced."
"Negative","poor reception: poor transmission quality and difficult to swap around to different channels while trying to drive at the same time."
"Positive","I love this book!: Cold Sassy Tree is a great book. I think that this is a book that everyone should read. It has romance for the girls and adventure for the guys. Anyone who is thinking about reading this book should give it a try."
"Negative","piece of crap: what a piece of crap. i just bought this game. played it for 2 mins. realized there is NO PITCHING. YOU HIT OFF A @!#$##$#$ TEE BALL STAND. THIS GAME BLOWS. IMMEDIATELY SOLD IT BACK TO AMAZON. bought all star baseball 2004 instead.. no challenge at all to this game. jacked homeruns like i was stealing jewelry from old ladies. TOO EASY. NO FUN."
"Positive","Vintage W.E.B, Griffin: If you're a Griffin fan, you've probably already read this book and series. The continuing saga of Lowell and company. It's still my favorite of all his series."
"Positive","""The Perfect Debut"": Some of the best lyrics I have heard in quite sometime. Oh, and also... This album ROCKS! Get it NOW!"
"Negative","Didn't expect preaching about God from a psychiatrist.: This book is riddled with references to God, church, and the Bible. That isn't really my cup of tea, and I was very surprised - there wasn't anything about a religious basis on the outside of the book. And I'm not so sure about their claim that all depression is caused by being stuck in a stage of unresolved grief."
"Negative","Don't bother buying it!: this dough blender is pretty useless. the wires are not reinforced which makes cutting cold butter into the flour almost impossible and very time-consuming. you're better off just using two knives or your fingers than this dough blender, that's for sure. what a disappointment!"
"Negative","I'm having some trouble with one port only works sometime: Trouble I'm having some trouble with one port only works sometimeTrouble I'm having some trouble with one port only works sometime"
"Negative","The Great Divide: Wallace and the Pomo Elite Fall: I have tried to read this book for three months now, but I am interrupted whenever I throw it across the room. It lacks the clarity and insight that grace your typical freshman calculus book, although it does have a lot more cutesy footnotes, and footnotes to the footnotes, all designed to cloak Wallace's resounding ineptitude.Having worn out his welcome in the literary world, Foster Wallace has turned to math and science for credibility. Unfortunately, even the mighty realm of mathematics is unable to suport his vast, bloated ego, as alluded to by the numerous Ph.D.'s, students, librarians, and lovers of wisdom who have seen this book for what it is--the once venerable WW Norton's attempt to print money.Unfortunately, the aging Wallace is no longer hip. Like the boy who cried ""wolf"" one too many times, Wallace and his group of insiders can no longer pull off literary Enrons."
"Negative","Save your money!: I like a good horror novel as much as anyone. I even like inane horror if it doesn't take itself too seriously and has some humour tossed in to flesh out those borng segments all novels have.This book has absolutely no redeeming value at all! The plot is idiotic. The characters are Ed Wood-ish attempting to be Steven Speilberg-ish and failing miserably! The story has to have been written by a bunch of stoned out trailer trash after a month long binge to come up with this tripe! It's that bad! It's not even a ""it's so bad it's funny"" type book. I highly suggest the author find another field of endeavor. And I highly suggest that anyone who is even remotely thinking of purchasing this so called ""novel"", save your money or just wait a few weeks. I'm sure you'll be able to purchse this for a few pennies before they toss it on the fire to keep warm."
"Negative","waste of time: It sounded great with a good cast but the execution is so amaturest that it was difficult to watch. Merman is Merman and Sinatra was fine but the script was terrible and the songs were rewritten for some reason. Maybe to make NBC or the sponsers happy but it sure wasn't Anything Goes. Even the Crosby version was better but not much. It's time to make a new film with the current Broadway script and the original Porter lyrics."
"Positive","back to old days!!: this is a great buy for any fan of 80s hair metal,as this is hair metal with new age rock.The rockers-""demolition man,back in your face,21st century girl,all night""are great & have guitar solos,something missing in X & thats why i hate that album.""kings of oblivion""&""disintegrate(guitar solo)""have the best guitaring in recent times.Ballads like""promises(got some mtv airplay),paper sun,its only love,day after day"" are good too.Overall a nice album which should make hair metal fans smile."
"Positive","It all comes down to this: In this book Fireheart becomes leader. Tigerstar also becomes leader to Tigerclan. A clan that is mixed by Shadowclan and Riverclan. Firestar then must lead Lionclan into battle with Bloodclan(a murderous clan of ally cats)and Tigerclan. Tigerstar is then double crossed by Scourge and killed in one blow. Fireheart and Tallstar now must face the most threatning thing to come to the forest. Or if they lose, they must leave the forest! This book is one of my favorites. Erin Hunter just doesn't stop! Pick it up, and never put in down!"
"Positive","Useful even at 40: I'm only 40 and found a lot of useful information in this book. Some of the information about exercise and the difference between heart rate zones as well as benefits of weight training are useful to me immediately, and other topics, although not relevant for me for 25 or 30 years, gave me things to think about that I can apply to my long-term life and financial planning. Immediately after finishing this book, I purchased a copy for my 67-year-old father."
"Negative","can't trust it: depending upon the surface you place it on, you will get different weights.Sometimes, it does not work.Sometimes, it will display different weights when it has not been moved.I can not tell if I actually weigh what it says so it is useless."
"Positive","Would have given 5 stars, but.......: This story was absolutely incredible. I listened to this one on CD and I was so anxious to get into my car to hear the rest of the story every day! I absolutely loved the storyline. It was great.The only reason I gave it 4 instead of five is because I thought they could have tied it up in a little prettier of a package. I had two many un answered questions that could have been beautifully answered with one more chapter.But still one of my favorites....."
"Negative","Almost unlistenable.: Like a lot of the other reviewers, I too am a huge Anita O'Day fan. She is a true original and, in her prime, jazz singing didn't get much better than Anita. This recording, however, is to be avoided. The arrangements are strong, and she is clearly trying her best, but she has no voice left and her timing is quite poor. Avoid this title (and, for that matter, ""Rules of the Road"" from 1993). Buy everything else, especially the Verve stuff. This one is for completists only."
"Positive","best cd: I think this is Throwdowns best cd. It has good lyrics and good breakdowns in every song. The singers voice takes a little while to get used to though."
"Negative","Not Kili's best work!: I recently bought all of the Island Girl Hula videos (except Basic Hula). I'd have to say out of all of them, this was my least favorite.The main reason being that the music was pretty bad, especially during the final dance. Also, I think Kili does a better job when she has her background dancers...in this one Kili is solo. I believe that this and basic hula are her earliest ones and I don't recommend either of them...try the other ones instead!"
"Positive","Panasonic SD-YD250: I bought this breadmaker new for the low price and am pleased with it. The only option that I miss is a delay timer."
"Positive","Good value for the money.: I bought this set for a family member. The quality is pretty good. The pattern is versatile."
"Negative","poorly done: I expected more for the price. I would have thought this came from the $5.00 basket from Wal-Mart. I returned it to Amazon for 1/2 the price of what I paid for it. It is just a copy of old films cuts poorly copied to DVD. This is not digitally enhanced. Stay away from Hudson Music unless you are a music history enthuses who wants the old film cuts for record keeping."
"Positive","GREAT product - But don't buy it for a crib biter / chewer: I originally thought I would apply this to the crib to keep the little piranha from chewing the rail. But once I opened the package and felt how soft it was, all I could imagine was coming in to see my son with a mouthful of padding.But if you are looking for an edge guard for a coffee table, counter top, etc... This is really great!"
"Negative","why my book's coverpage has so many scratches: I don't know why my book coverpage has some damages. The front page was rived. The side of books has so many scratchs, It is a new condition book? That is a joke! The book condition just looks like good not new. I don;t know why looks like old book sold as new."
"Positive","Great little oven: I am very happy with the toaster oven. It is just the right size and does everything I need."
"Negative","A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT: After reading such novels as PLEADING GUILTY and BURDEN OF PROOF, I was looking forward to reading the next installment.But, this novel was was of a lesser quality: flatter characters, not as much pacing and, just an overall lesser sense of emotional resonance.Note that this was after reading about 40 pages, but, my feeling is: if a book can't hold me after 40 pages, it isn't worth reading."
"Positive","Good features for the money: I just purchased this scanner not too long ago. This is my first scanner purchase. The USB interface makes it very simple to install. The one-touch scanning buttons on the front make scanning quick and easy. The software that ships with the scanner can be a little tricky to learn to use, however it seems to have all the tools to edit a photo the way want it. Overall this is a good scanner for home use."
"Negative","Shocking, Just Shocking: What surprises me is the amount of attention this book has received. It's simply not any good. There is no narrative whatsoever in it, the ""pieces"" simply line up with one liner after one liner. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about the book is the glowing review it received from poet John D'Agata in a magazine recently. He's an otherwise very smart guy, so I don't know what's up with that. I just don't think this book is worth this hoopla. If you've been recommended this bok I suggest you try first Wenderoth's first book, which is a true biggie or artistic brilliance. This ones just clever."
"Negative","TERRIBLE: This game was NOTHING like what I expected. The grafics stunk, it was slow and VERY outdated. Sorry I wasted my money on it. AND I understood it was ""new""...it was NOT new! I will never buy from them again."
"Positive","Really gets the poop off: I've tried other unscented wipes that I bought from Amazon, but these really have worked the best. I don't think they're that rough on my baby's skin, but also because of their texture they really get the poop off, so I end up using fewer and have to wipe less. I highly recommend these.The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is that with this particular packaging you always get a plastic dispenser, which I end up throwing away because it's hard-to-recycle #5 plastic (how many can I keep?), and that's not great for the environment.As far as the cost factor goes, they are available for less on a per wipe basis at [...], but with Amazon you can get them delivered to your door, so that's a trade-off."
"Negative","Look elsewhere!: These wings DO NOT look like the picture. They are simply cardboard arches with feathers stuck on, they are not shaped like the picture but rather straight up/down from top to bottom not flared as shown. They have to elastic loops in the center for the kids to put their arms through and they continuously slide down their arms. My 3 yr old hated these and took them off half way through trick or treating. For the price I thought they would be a little better construction."
"Negative","It just keeps getting worse: I give high praise to Robert Jordan for his early books in the Wheel of Time series. Unfortunately his later books keep getting progressively worse.Don't even bother reading Crossroads of Twilight. Nothing happens. It is actually pretty amazing that Jordan can fill so many pages in a book and still not advance the plot.I'm finished reading his books. I might pick them up again if he ever finishes the series but I'm done waiting to the next installment in his saga.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"
"Positive","This test is quick and simple to use. ...: This test is quick and simple to use. It's an excellent product for women who want to get pregnant. Unlike other products the lines were easy to see and there were no messy cups involved. The best part is you don't have to use your first go at the bathroom! You can use the product any time of the day or night."
"Negative","Too Many MD's: This book is poorly written. Too many Doctors and not one of them can write a complete sentence without over explaining. And then the next sentence attempts to describe the previous sentence. Mostly, so far, it's just self serving tripe. I am getting my doctorate in Naturopathy and this is required reading. If I didn't have to read it, I certainly wouldn't."
"Positive","Bad Horse: Move over, Rockie Horror! What a hoot this is! I saw it online of course, & then at Dragon Con where it was presented a la Rocky Horror w/costumed actors on stage in front of the screen & things to throw. Now I've got it on disk to stop & rewind :D Plus the commentary which rocks LOLHow fun!BBTeleri"
"Positive","Nothin 2 Say: Their in nothin more 2 say cos this is a Bangin music from mary mary.The most influencial album of all time.All the songs in the album is bangin.If u haven't got the cd ,go get 1 as soon a spossible."
"Positive","Basic, Simple, Fun: I purchased this product for my office. As I am in a ""high traffic"" area and almost always leave my office unlocked, I wanted a dock for my iPod that wasn't overly expensive. Other factors when deciding to purchase the Satechi: I needed something that wouldn't take up a lot of space; I didn't need a lot of volume; I wanted to know there was good customer service behind the product; I wanted a dock that was sturdy and charged the iPod when in use.I am VERY pleased with the Satachi Dock Station. It looks great, it's really easy to use, it has a modern look to it and it's exactly what I was picturing....however, if you want sound like a Bose or need control of things like bass & treble, this is not the dock for you. Like they say, you get what you pay for: think tinny, treble-filled sound that doesn't exactly blast away the walls!I highly suggest this dock if your needs for sound are similar to mine."
"Negative","not worthy of the paper it's printed on!: This is a pathetic excuse for a book. Mr. Stratton seems delighted to stuff his pages full of all sorts of useful info on how to fight your pitbull ( a FELONY) and not get caught; how to befriend your local vet so that he will sew your dog back together without telling on you; and how to isolate your dog and degrade him into the agressive killer you wish he was. It is a sad commentary that this book does nothing more that feed the inhumane frenzy of scary, powerless men and women turning a defenseless puppy into an agressive fighting machine to make themselves feel big and strong. YUCK! Both the publisher and AMAZON continue to carry this book built on some first amendment call to arms. Let's have a reality check: this is no Ulysseus! Perhaps Mr. Stratton's next book can combine freedom of speech with the responsibility one should have toward innocent animals of all kinds. Why put sick work like this into the hands and minds of dangerous people?"
"Negative","run away from this steaming pile of shi...: Bought it on 3 Oct 2006, through a authorized dealer in Singapore.1. broke down after a few weeks, repaired by Swatch Group Singapore.2. broke down after a few weeks, repaired.3. broke down after a few weeks, replacement watch.4. broke down after a few weeks, repaired.5. broke down after a few weeks, I don't want the watch to be ""repaired"" anymore, I want a refund."
"Positive","Perceptive business book...: Little things make the difference between success and failure in life. ""Blink"" gives example of how the mind works silently to guide us to the ""best"" decision. Those who master skills described in this book and not recognized by most will beat the competition. Read this if you're in sales and marketing."
"Negative","Don't bother: Don't waste your time and money on this game-it's not worth it. The story idea is interesting but it's hard to navigate (it's easy to miss a location) and a lot of the tasks you're required to do don't make sense (I couldn't have made it past the opening scenes without the walkthrough, embarrassingly enough)I got bored a third of the way through and quit. It's a good idea, but it didn't turn into a good game."
"Positive","friction mount: This device works well enough on a reasonably rough surface, but tends to move, on smooth surfaces especially if there is any vibration. The bottom needs a ""more sticky"" surface."
"Positive","A beautifully written book. A piece of good literature.: I can't believe this book wasn't a front runner for the National Book Award. Charming Billy was a tiresome book. The runner-up for the National Book Award, A Man in Full, by Tom Wolfe was trite...also ridiculous!"
"Negative","Program listings: Although the original FORTRAN77 version of Numerical Recipes is highly acclaimed (and rightfully so, it is really worth every buck) I do not recommend this FORTRAN90 book. I was very disappointed when I received it. A huge part of the book only contains F90 program listings for the same routines that are derived and discussed in detail in Volume I (F77). The two new introductory chapters make it not worth buying the book. Instead, get the Numerical Recipes CD-ROM which includes the source code for C, F77, F90 and other languages and maybe a good introductory or reference book on F90.(The review of ""oblinqued"" down below is obviously referring to the original book as the F90 book was not available in 1991)."
"Negative","EA Definitely Messed It Up!: Well, I have to agree with the author that stated EA messed up what used to be a good game. I constantly play Nascar Thunder 2003 and thought that 2004 looked better. WRONG. Granted, the graphics are a lot better, but that's the only thing that has improved. The gameplay has been ruined - the graphics are so overdone that a white ""wall"" of what looked like smoke would appear every so often in the game. Personally, it looks like EA just used the code for the PS1 version of the game and beefed up the graphics. The sound is pathetic - doesn't even sound like a real car like 2003 does. It's also not compatible with the Logitch wheel. The same day I bought my copy I had it up for sale if that tells you anything."
"Positive","clear descriptions: The book is pitched towards a final year of high school or a first undergraduate year. Where the latter is perhaps for a non-chemistry major. Moore writes straightforwardly about basic concepts like Avogardro's Number and molarity.There is also some coverage of organic chemistry. Of necessity, this goes little beyond definitions of the main organic types, like ethers, esters and aldehydes. Organic chemistry has a rich network of synthesis pathways that the text can only touch the fringes of. Yet hopefully, a keen student might be encouraged enough to remember these terms and even venture deep into chemistry."
"Positive","AWESOME!: THE DIAMOND RIO 600 IS UNREAL! SURE, IT MIGHT ONLY ME 32MEGS, BUT IT'S AWESOME! THE SOUND QUALITY IS AS GOOD AS THE RIO 500 OR NOMAD, BUT THE BUNDLED HEADPHONES ARE ONLY AVERAGE. THE PLAYER IS LOADED WITH FEATURES INCLUDING A COO BLUE BACKLIT DISPLAY, DSP (SAME AS EQ) SETTINGS AND HEAPS MORE. IT EVEN HAS 'NOKIAPHONE' STYLE CHANGEABLE COVERS! HOVEVER, THE BLUE STILL LOOKS GREAT! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLAYER! THE SOFTWARE IS ALSO GREAT AND THE PLAYER ITSELF IS REASONABLY SMALL AND VERY LIGHT. IT ALSO HAS A SLOT FOR MEMORY EXPANSIONS UP TO 420MB! THAT'S ENOUGH FOR AROUND 110 CD-QUALITY MP3 FILES! THIS PLAYER ALSO SUPPORTS WMA. BUY IT TODAY!"
"Positive","WELL WORTH THE PRICE!: I PAID ABOUT $11 FOR THIS. IMAGE IS CRISP. FOCUS AND ZOOM ARE EASY TO SET AND STAY PRETTY WELL PUT. NO GOOD FOR ""DIY"" SPERM COUNTERS, BUT GREAT FOR SHOWING AN 8 YEAR OLD THE HIDDEN LITTLE THINGS ALL AROUND."
"Positive","School Review: I have shown this 2000 Royal Ballet Version to my elementary students. Normally it is hard for students to sit still for more than a few minutes during the holiday season, but they were totally enchanted with the costumes, the story, and the dancing. In fact, even though some of my students have been in local productions of the Nutcracker, they say this film is one of the best productions they have ever seen. I have seen other Royal Ballet versions, and the Baryshnikov version--this one has more passion and more style. In fact, only a few of my students knew about the Mama Gigione version they had seen in local ballet productions. I highly recommend this to all serious Nutcracker aficionados."
"Positive","Cold milk!: Milk stays cold in these glasses. What a treat! We regularly wash them in the dishwasher with no problems.I have some of the 2 oz glasses in the same style that I use for espresso shots and was so pleased with those that I bought these."
"Negative","Teen-ager's garage rock.: The rythms to all the songs are the same. The guitar is too blasty. These are the kind of songs I expect to be used in certain movie scenes. Will never buy such a cd."
"Negative","It was ok while it lasted.: We got this game for our six year old last Summer. The kids really liked playing it but every time you push down the ghost, playing pieces would fall off. Eventually, it got to be very annoying for us and the kids. The board is not sturdy at all and we never could get the stairs to stay on or the spider web and the moose head was a pain to put together. We just tossed it."
"Positive","Jerry Miller - Life is like that: From a die-hard Moby Grape fan - this is one excellent blues album. Jerry's guitar work is world class. Have seen him live in Seattle area a number of times and he never fails to disappoint. An excellent addition to any blues collection!"
"Positive","AWESOME BLU RAY!!: I recieved Phenomena blu ray and I got to tell ya, the picture and sound are terrific and cool special features!! And it's region free (ABC)!! Arrow video is the way to go to get these movie classics on blu ray. I won my bid for The Funhouse blu ray on region free on ebay, can't wait to get that one! Arrow video.. you guys ROCK!!!!"
"Positive","Great size if you like your drinks cold: The size of the ice cubes, while small, are great if you love your drinks cold, but don't like the big ice cubes clunking up your glass and keeping you from drinking more at a time. Small problem, but this takes care of that!"
"Negative","Its compleate rubbish: When White Wolf ended the World of Darkness and quickly replaced it with new games, I thought it might be interesting. What they did instead was do a horrible job of writing, along with taking bits of the old games and just obscured them. People seem to love it since they do spice it up with pictures and such just to make people think its better than it really is. The only good quality of any nWoD book is the dice system. Vampire: The Requiem is one of the worst Roleplaying games, followed up by Werewolf: The Forsaken. Do yourselves a favor by saving your time and money and just stay away from these games."
"Positive","Diana: Her True Story-In Her Own Words: I found this author extremely informative and very sympathetic to Diana, Princess of Wales. I feel that Andrew Morton has done a brilliant job with the re-release of this book. The content was most shocking and very sad. But it seems to be true if you look at her life over the years.I have grown very much interested witht he monarchy, unfortunatly because of her death. This book also illustrates the life of Royalty, in lay terms. I found this to be helpful in understanding this way of life.I hope he continues to inform the public on the future of the Monarchy and any new developments in these peoples lives. Brilliant work!"
"Negative","CASPER IS FRIENDLY, NOT THIS MOVIE: Other Than Despite, The Very Good Special Effects and Christina Ricci's Performance, this low-brow, unentertainment smash of hot dogs, is so dull, and boring, you can't even think what happens next, Bull Pullman, Cathy Moriarty, Eric Idle utterly wasted in this film, and the plot is uninteresting, borrowing from Ghost. Miserable."
"Negative","Do not start on this series, it is a waste of time: Game of Throne starts out strong with interesting characters, however the author failed to develop those characters in his books.If you are interested in reading dull history of an artificial world, than this book if for you. There is no story here, hisstory leads no where. If you have the patient to suffer through the five books series, I guarantee that you will be disappointed.There are much better way to use your time, like watching grass grow."
"Negative","Unconformity and nuisance: I am extremely annoying and nuisance with the I articulate that they sent me. This cellular telephone is used and this damaged one. I need a prompt answer for solutions this problem and all the inconveniences that have caused me.Thank you!"
"Negative","don't waste your money: We got this for our 6 year old son for Christmas, and what a disappointment. We followed the advice of a previous reviewer and got Hotweels cars specifically marked for the race tracks (think they're called Race Stars?). Anyway, it still didn't work. I think we got one car to go around the track twice, and after that . . . nothing. And we were careful to follow the instructions. We are planning to return the toy, and hopefully find something that will work. But that doesn't make up for a disappointed kid on Christmas morning."
"Negative","Hard Work to Enjoy this Book: If you enjoy babbling streams of semi-consciousness from the point of view of a despicably self-involved main character, you'll love slogging through this dense mass of text that begs for a real story."
"Negative","This CD has hippie written all over it.: The music from Smash Mouth's latest album lacks everything Fush Yu Mang was. I loved their earlier album and this one is just sorry. They took out the variety and originality of music from the earlier album and replaced it with a bunch of hippie loving music. And what was Road Man trying to prove. Oh and Diggin' Your Scene made me want to hurl."
"Positive","Gotta Love Kristin Hannah: This is the third Kristin Hannah book that I have read and again she didn't disappoint! She has a knack for developing great characters and stories with just enough drama to keep you reading. This is a story about a women who is going through major life changes after her daughter leaves for college. Her life is turned upside down and she has to figure out how to put her life back togeher and who will be there when she does. I don't like giving away too much about books in the review so that is all I will say. We read this for our book club and were amazed by the great discussion we had after. We didn't know if we would have a lot to discuss until we started reading the group discussion questions and the end of the book, we ended up talking for hours!"
"Positive","WONDERFULL!: What a surprise for me! I'm old Supertramp and, of course, Roger Hodgson fan. I listen thousand times most beautiful Supertramp albums: ""Crisis? What Crisis?"", ""Breakfast In America"", ""Famous Last Words"" and Roger Hodgson's ""In The Eye Of The Storm"". But... OPEN THE DOOR IS THE ONE OF THE BEST PROGRESSIVE ROCK ALBUMS I'VE EVER HEARD. The music sounds like classical Supertramp songs, lyrics - is better than music! Simply buy this album, if you are real Supertramp fan!"
"Negative","Easily cut, poor design.: Worked well for a month, then one day wouldn't open. It was putting in the correct combination (my daughter's birthday!), but no luck. I tried numbers all around that combo, nothing. Other people tried to no avail. I was stranded with a toddler, at noon, on a hot, humid day miles from home and had to wait for a friend to come with bolt cutters. He freed the bike in less than a minute, which makes me realize how flimsy this thing really is. I think the dial that is used to set the combination must have been inadvertantly turned while in my bag, causing the lock to jam. I will not trust combination locks any longer."
"Negative","Unbleieveably amateurish!!: I was one of those who could not wait for the next Grisham novel. For whatever reason I had not kept up with his latest couple or so. This one, was obviously written for one reason, and one reason only, to catitalize on his name. It is without question one of the worst books I have read. The plot(?) is telegraphed within the first couple of chapters. There are virtually no suprises in the whole book, except for the fact that there are no suprises. Character developement is shallow, superficial and meaningless. Rotten Read! I will have to pause before reading ""The Testament"" which I have available."
"Positive","Great selection: Fire and Ice is very nicely executed by Sarah Chang, and it's great to hear some of the unusual pieces (Sarasate) alongside better known pieces like Meditation, etc. Overall more fire than ice, I think - and a second copy will provide a gift for a fussy lady who loves violin!"
"Negative","Horrible Cd: I give this Cd 1 star because you can't give it anything less. The songs are horrible, Enrique Iglesias does not know how to sing and he thinks he it the greatest thing on this universe. It seems like if he is crying, has a stomach ache, and pushing(like if he is going to deliver a baby or something) while he is singing. A waste of money and time."
"Positive","Love this lens: I absolutely love this lens. For $90 you can't go wrong and the pictures are just what I wanted. Nice and clear with the required depth of field and nice blurring in the background."
"Negative","big disappointment: This book belongs on the ""out of print"" list. A promising title, but lousy content. Instead of providing useful materials on developing telephony applications in Visual Basic, the authors, in essence, used this book as promotional material for their own Visual Voice software component which works with Visual Basic 1.0, long outdated considering VB 6.0 is about to be replaced with VB.Net . The rest of the book is an overview of Visual Basic, telephony terminology, and even talks of Windows 3.1. This book is overdue for the recycling bins."
"Negative","Low brow comedy that will be forgotten in a few days: I was looking forward to seeing this one because it had the dude from the Office in it that has his moments. However, it sucked and it sucked badly. It felt incomplete, contrived and hollow. No great lines, no clever plot, no moments of comedy where you feel like you want to see it again because the first time through it was pure torture. What do you expect from a movie with unfunny men on film? Buy this movie if you're stupid or for your kids if they're stupid. You'll laugh your asses off, but at what I will never know. Dim bulbs seem to love this one..."
"Negative","Great camera if you can afford one a year: I got this sd400 to replace my s400 which after a year started giving me a memory card error message. I now find out that was a design flaw. Anyway, i spent hundreds of dollars on this one, and now, just over a year after I got it, it won't hold a battery charge. I loved both cameras while they worked, but I can't afford a $400 camera plus the related accessories every year or so. I've written to Canon tech support. Unless they are willing to repair or replace this one free of charge, I'm moving on to another brand camera!"
"Positive","Amazing!: All of the Harry Potter books are fantastic! I thought that they might be a little young for me, but they have a quality which attracts all ages of readers. I recommend this book and the other two also to every reader out there who enjoys any type of fantasy."
"Negative","...: If theres one thing I can give this otherwise untalented band, its that they're sounding more like P.O.D everyday. I think thats where most ""Christian Metal"" (which is a paradox) end up at.As for this band, just read my UnderOath review. The only good metal is metal that isnt about God."
"Positive","Good reading: I picked up ""Mists of Avalon"" after seeing ads for the TNT movie. I was intrigued by the idea of a retelling of the King Arthur saga from the female perspective. As a child I was fascinated with King Arthur story, but always wished there was more about the women.This book was so much more than I expected. I learned a lot about pagan and Druid religions and a lot about what the ""new"" religion of Christianity meant for these people.Morgaine (Morgan Le Fay) has always been portrayed as evil, but as the main character of this book, she was very sympathetic.The only complaint that I have of this book is the length. I am normally not intimidated by long books, but this one could have used some editing.I highly recommend it nonetheless."
"Negative","Works TOO good! Battery destruction and other fun!: I received the 2 port USB car charger a week ago and have just gotten a chance to try it out. At first everything seemed to working well with it. It charged my Fiance's Samsung Moment extremely fast... almost...too fast. It went from 28% to 100% in about 4 minutes! I was amazed! Then I thought about the damage that can cause and quickly unplugged the phone from the charger. I was unfortunately too late. Her battery is now ruined and I need to buy a new one. This charger achieved the incredible charge rate by over-volting. This is extremely dangerous for delicate electronics such as cell phones, gps, tablets, ya know, things this charger is apparently designed for. Sadly her phone no longer holds a charge and you can watch the battery gauge drop 10% a second as soon as its unplugged from a good charger. Next time I will buy a quality name brand charger for something expensive such as cell phones. Lesson learned."
"Positive","Better than the ""Big Names"": It is amazing what celebrity can accomplish. Attanasio has to be one of the greatest sci-fi writers around but who do we hear about - Azimov (very formulaic and mechanical), Clarke (who has published some of the best/worst potboilers around) or any of the other ""Founding Fathers"" of science fiction.How else can one praise this magnificent work of art - the characters (including the brain) are all interesting, the story is one we've heard before but is handled so well that it seems refreshingly new, the plot is especially well designed but even better is the execution. Dialogue was perfect and the writing was just this side of poetic.The long chase scene and the switches in scenery seemed to fit in effortlessly in the plot. Great book."
"Negative","disgusting: The point of this movie is the opposite of what it purports to be. `Bang Bang You're Dead' was clearly designed to pollute innocent minds. It pretends to have a morally uplifting message. But nothing could be further from the truth. In case you are nave about what is going on in the world; there is a network of criminals who control the media. This network of criminals is focused on corrupting the minds of innocent children. They are trying to create chaos in the world. This movie, among other things, is telling children that one possible reaction to being bullied at school is to kill people. These criminal filmmakers get away with this type of message by pretending to say, ""Killing people is a bad idea."" In reality, the point of the film is to put the idea into the minds of children that killing people is an option.Putting this type of imagery into the mind of a child is criminal behavior. ""Teachers"" who are having their students watch this film should be arrested for child abuse. Word"
"Positive","Someone doesn't know his Bible: I must respectfully take issue with those reviewers who feel this novel errs in its biblical foundations. As a tenured divinity college professor, I can attest that the biblical references cited are simpatico with Judeo-Christian scripture. Further, I find nothing here to offend even orthodox Jewry. Bear in mind, the book is not religious in genre, it's a secular, mainstream novel, and an exceptionally well written and thoughtful book that too many people are getting overly upset about. THE LAST DAY is a wonderfully engaging and challenging suspense thriller. Why not simply let people read it and enjoy it? I'm including it in my curriculum."
"Positive","Label Lover: How did I live without this thing for so long? I've gone label-crazy. Next, I'm labeling all my shoe boxes. It takes a few minutes to figure it out, but then voila! Labels for anything and everything. Easy to use, small, medium and large font sizes, choice of fonts--lots of fun. Label on!"
"Negative","A dated, trite & slightly amusing outline of consumer spending habits by class, c.1983: The bulk of this book is dedicated to consumer spending habits and while much has changed over the last 25 years (original copyright of 1983), there is a considerable amount that has stayed the same. There are some nuggets, but they are few and far between.It is a light and fluffy distraction easily dispensed with in an afternoon. Those with a serious sociological interest would be far more satisfied with the work of Mills.Just be sure to get it from the library, your bookshelves would not be complimented by it's presence."
"Positive","Simply works for Dell Dimension 8400: I Upgraded my old Dell Dimension 8400 Desktop from its original 1GB RAM (2 Sticks of 512mb) to 4 GB Ram (4 Sticks of 1GB). Although this is not the same brand that came in the Dell Dimension, the PNY Branded RAM works just fine. I am able to run windows 7 and various memory consuming applications such as Autocad fairly well on the old desktop.There not very much to say about RAM, because it is what it is; either it works or it doesn't.If you are purchasing for a Dell Dimension 8400 I can confirm it does work well.As always I try to write helpful insightful reviews for every purchase i make here on amazon.comGood luck!"
"Positive","Great for light duty sweeping: I purchased this sweeper because I was recovering from back surgery and would be spending a lot of time at home. I needed something very light weight to keep my small, carpeted apartment fairly clean. I was pleasantly surprised by this sweeper's ability to pick up my and my cat's hair, and both of us have long hair, as well as the falling leaves from my hanging ferns. It even picked up spilled coffee grounds from my linoleum kitchen floor! The only problem that I have encountered is that it REALLY picks up electrical cords! Of course, I wouldn't recommend doing a shag rug with this sweeper, but it's great on low-pile carpeting and bare floors."
"Negative","Not terrible but definitely not great.: Infected Mushroom has been around for a while, which is why I am so surprised that their music has yet to mature. Anyone who is familiar with the goa/psytrance scene must be aware that there are far far better producers than IM at this time. They may have been one of the pioneers of the genre, but they have since been eclipsed by better talent. If you don't believe me, feel free to email me and I will gladly send you (via mail or AOL IM link-up)one of my personal dj mixes which contain only non-commercial and underground producers (Son Kite, Noma, Timetech, Reefer Decree, etc.). I love the music and try to turn on as many people as possible. Email is djarchetype21@hotmail.com"
"Positive","greatest tracks of all time: daft punk has really scored a 10 out of 10 on this cd. it goes from hi enegry that makes you want to party all night(Aerodynamic)(One More Time) to chill out and spend time with someone you care about(Something about Us). this is one cd that will certainly be around for years to come and also be forever part of the greatesthits of all time. Normally echno cds have one hit but this cd has all hits."
"Positive","It Just Works :): This is the first Bluetooth headset I've owned. It was simple to set up and is simple to use. A genuine featherweight, the headset is very comfortable to wear... even for hours.Leaving my cell phone [a Motorola Razr] lying on the island in the kitchen, I've roamed up to 20-25 feet away, wandering anywhere in our house or backyard without losing the connection.At my end the reception is clear and static free. Those I phone say they cannot tell that I am using a wireless headset to talk to them -- no echo, excessive ambient noise, or other distortions.Recommended without reservation!"
"Positive","Great Product!: This truly gives such a wonderful finish. I have many make up brushes to apply foundation with and even with much blending, leaves my skin not as flawless as this beauty blender. I give it four stars because I do wash them after every use and the last time I was cleaning I lightly scratched it to get some extra foundation off and a piece of the actual beauty blender came off. Be extra gentle while cleaning. It is pricey, and it is a great make up tool, but I hope they hold up for a while for the price."
"Negative","A bit bitter: I didn't find much point to this book. I found the bickering, gossip and ill feelings out of place for a group that is supposed to be worshipping God and having goodwill toward others - especially their own fellow congregants."
"Negative","Good Product, But did not work for what I had intended: I bought this controller solely to play the PC version of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and it was incompatible, unfortunately. The controller is exactly like a regular xbox controller and no complaints on the construction."
"Negative","Way too sweet and reconstituted texture: I would give this really a 1.5 star, but I was generous. It is way too sweet. Others have said the same in their reviews, but I ignored them to my chagrin. It is very very thin and has a texture and appearance like it has been reconstituted and highly processed. Because it is so thin, there are never any big lumps of gristle, but sometimes you can tell the meat quality as a bit off in some pieces. The worst problem is the overly sweet flavor, the second problem is the texture and meat quality. This is not a very good jerky. Their Buffalo, while also too sweet, is much better as is their Turkey. They are much much less expensive than a really premium jerky like those from Mountain America, so it is a toss up. For the price, I may re-order the Turkey and perhaps Buffalo, but I will never order this Beef again."
"Negative","Not worth the time to read: Not nearly useful enough to justify the time spent reading it. It seems to be a series of short articles with recipes, household hints, etc."
"Positive","Fusilli Drawer Pulls ~ A+++++++: The Fusilli Drawer Pulls are great quality and a great value. I bought the Satin Nickel Pulls to go in my kitchen...they look great against the espresso finish of my cabinets. Would recommend!!!"
"Positive","Legacy: Native American Photogravures & Music: As a long time admirer of Edward Sheriff Curtis's photography, I was thrilled to find this DVD and now, to own it. The first time I watched I felt frustrated because I wanted to know when and where the photos were taken, but there was no information accompanying the images. The second time through I opted to watch with subtitles--all my questions were answered. I recommend this video to anyone who loves photography, as I do, and to those of us who appreciate and respect Native American culture. The sound track with music made by Native Americans enhances the experience. This DVD is a gem."
"Negative","This CD is not bad, but it still seems a little rusty.: Jennifer Daniels has joined the girl with a guitar club that has become a part of the pop rock music of today. She does have a powerful voice, but at times it tends to overpower the rest of the musical sound. The entire CD mix does not seem to have the feel of a professional finish. It sounds more like they ran out of time and money so they had to go with what they had already recorded. With a little more time to determine what direction she wants her music to go perhaps she will have a better sound. As of now I think there will be those who will enjoy her offbeat melodic sounds and there will be those who will feel that her lyrics and her sound are not their favorite. She is better in concert, so if you are disapointed with the CD sound I recommend seeing her live because then she gets a better mix for her sound."
"Negative","QUALITY BUT....: I have a previous version of this item and it works beautifully. This model, slightly upgraded, does not...I use it to close shave my head everyday and the blades just aren't close enough. On my previous model, I was able to unscrew the blades and align the cut as close as 0mm. This new model has an ""upgraded"" blade head that has the blades screwed together. In other words, they aren't adjustable.The product does display a quality fit and finish however. It just doesn't do (due to mechanical changes in manufacture) what I needed it to."
"Negative","Cut and Paste: Cut and paste Mr. Peikert's experience into this space. I went through an almost identical experience. The drive functioned for me for about 1 month; I burned maybe four DVDs with it. Same problem with being able to contact tech support. Jump through stupid hoops even though you know the hardware is faulty. Jeez...... my blood is starting to boil all over just thinking about dealing with these idiots. I unfortunately I have not gotten to the point of getting an RMA. I am still waiting for another tech support response. Last thing: don't even think about misplacing your driver software. Unlike every other manufacturer in the world, Sony does not make its device drivers readily available for download. If you misplace your drivers, you have to BUY another CD-rom and wait for it to come in the mail..... ridiculous. I should have known better after having problems with the last Sony piece of hardware I bought (a PDA) and getting the same run around then. Never again Sony... you STINK!"
"Positive","Great book for building long term wealth: This is a great book for someone who is looking for long term investing, the books helps you understand the drivers behind the real estate market and how to start and stay in the game."
"Positive","So Relaxing: This has been one of my favorite CD's for years, and I was sorry to lose my copy. The new recording is a little less subtle than the original, but it is still lovely."
"Negative","A bitter disappointment--: After loving The Fingerpost, I raced to get Pears' The Dream of Scipio, hopinghopinghoping to have a comparable experience. I tried hard; I tried it twice, a month or so apart. But I could not lose the sense of pushing a peanut around with my nose without ever being allowed to eat it. The characters are flat; we're never sure why we're being asked to pay attention to them; the writing lurches and stutters and embarrasses itself, as in ""It was a moment, he realized later, that summed up his whole existence in a tiny moment, like the world reflected in a tiny bead of water as it falls to earth"" (64). Whaaaa--? Is Mr. Pears' editor asleep at the wheel? I gave up."
"Positive","Good stuff, poor sound quality: I have been a Joan Baez fan since I was a child. Her early works are especially appealing because her young voice was so perfectly sweet, high and clear.HOWEVER, that said, this is not a great recording. The cuts are pretty much unedited. There is a lot of ambient noise, and maybe some people feel that adds a cool ambiance, but for me it is really distracting and annoying. A live performance doesn't have to sound bad. Also, there is no equalizing going on - sometimes the guitar playing just sounds like loud, hard, repetitive (and boring) strumming.Anyway, it brought back a lot of good memories and made me appreciate the advances in recording technology that have come along since the 60s."
"Positive","Pushing Tin was great!: If you are looking for a different movie, with no violence and some good humor, then rent Pushing Tin. Pushing Tin is about an air traffic control who is going through a mid life crisis. This movie is really neat and different. And it focuses on something other then violence."
"Positive","No more waking nightmares.: One of my favorite things to do is dream. One of my least favorite things is waking up. Especially violently and at the will of some evil, red eyed, demon alarm clock howling obscenities in strange digital tongues.Most of my relationships with such clocks come to a violent end before reaching even six months and there I am again, off with bloody knuckles to waste more money on another clock that will soon meet the same fate.Enough history, I was given a Zen clock by someone who is well familiar with the nature of my sunny morning routines and......AT LAST!It has not only survived for almost a year now without even causing me to raise an eyebrow but it provides a gentle and peaceful way to begin the day and I find the better I start my day the better it is all together."
"Negative","terrible: He is one of the worst musicians in the entire world.Segovia was right on when he supported parkening, wiliams and russell.but he lost his mind when he praised fisk.Absolutely no musician ship."
"Negative","PowerDirector 5: I have read several forums and reviews on Powerdirector 5. In short I have to agree with what has been said, Save your money. The program crashes all the time no matter what you are doing. The features are ok but not worth $80.00. The computer system I am using far exceeds what Cyberlink recommends to run this program. It took me four hours to make a five minute slide show due to the constant crashing. I am sorry I did not continue to look further at other programs. I'll shelf it and just put it with other junk I have bought over time.The disk will make an interseting glass coaster."
"Positive","Often Seen As Their Weakest Album: ""The Queen Is Dead"" is the Smiths album that receives the most praise, perhaps rightfully so, and ""Meat Is Murder"" is the album which tends to be seen as their weakest (when the NME writers recently compiled their list of the 100 Best Albums of All Time this was the only Smiths album that did not make the list). However, it is still an excellent achievement with only the final two songs letting it down somewhat as they go on far too long unnecessarily repeating themselves over and over. It is easily their rockiest album overall as ""The Headmaster Ritual,"" ""I Want The One I Can't Have,"" ""What She Said"" and others show, yet it also contains two of the most incredibly beautiful songs they ever did in ""Well I Wonder"" and ""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore"" (the latter being my all-time favorite Smiths song)."
"Negative","My cat is trained but not by this method: I was determined to get our new cat toilet trained and researched You Tube and Amazon for theories and information. I finally settled on this book because this author was supposed to be the original expert from the 90s. Well, in the 21 day program, we got half way through successfully, but then came the plastic wrap over the toilet and it was a disaster. I changed to ""The Toilet Trained Cat"" method which was to use an aluminum pan and it worked great. It actually took us 60 days to train the cat and we did have a few challenges, but it was worth it. My cat has been using the toilet for 2 months now with great success. My daughter and I laugh now when we walk by the litter isle at Target because we don't need to buy that overpriced smelly junk anymore. Don't give up. It will work!"
"Positive","Holidays!: One of our favorite family time Christmas movies! Family tradition watching this with the children. If the kids had their way they would watch everyday!"
"Negative","badly needs an update: Many of the open questions have since been answered or redefined with the MAP and Planck satellite missions. Unless you plan to supplement your reading of this book, look elsewhere first."
"Negative","$99 - is someone having a laugh?: Come on - I saw this after buying an almost identical Melissa & Doug wooden bead set at a well known store for $12.99. This sort of con shouldn't be on Amazon."
"Negative","Incredibly boring, but effective workout: If you can withstand the exceptionally boring presentation and unmotivating banter, then you will get a good workout. The setup is good, where you can choose whether you want to do upper body, lower body or your abs. But that's just the menu. Jackie is sarcastic and not amusing. Her motivation is limited to ""you can do anything for a minute"" and the guidance on perfect form is minimal in the workout portions. Even her trainers seem like they don't want to be there, so why would I want to do this workout ever again?I used this dvd a few times simply because it was a quick and effective workout, but the mind-numbing aspects have moved it to the bottom of my workout list."
"Positive","The ultimate book that covers every part of fasting & health: I have read every book I can find on fasting. This book is by far the best resource on fasting and proper eating than any other book I can find concerning this subject. This book has all their medical information backed up with references. I personally have followed their advice and have lost 26 pounds in 24 days and never felt better. Don't pass up this book unless you're not serious about fasting or losing weight."
"Negative","Only after you've read everything else: This is a hard core conservative's dream book of truth. Hard core liberals will read it to make them feel superior. Unfortunately it's just a bad book that seems to have been, literally, thrown together. Repitition and bad editing are evident throughout.The first 2 chapters about early calls and the probable effect on voting nationwide are pretty interesting. Not only is the case laid out pretty well but the topic has never been widely covered. No doubt because the people who caused the problem are the one's who would have to do the covering.After these chapters, it's pretty much the same formula over and over. Gore, and almost everybody who worked for his campaign, are vile swill. Bush, and the Bushies, are honest, fearless, etc. While undoubtedly true, it gets boring and really not worth reading."
"Positive","Best series I have ever read, sans doubt.: It was a very interesting book, with a full rich world. I have read all the books in the series numerous times and cannot decide which is my favourite. The book is set in a civilisation that compares with about 1000 AD. Except that women have important roles in society. I recommend the entire series to everyone."
"Positive","An Excellent Help in Understanding Isaiah: Dr. Smith is one of the finest Old Testament scholars in the United States and his expertise in Old Testament prophets shines through these two volumes. The great contribution he makes is in helping the student to understand not only the social context(s) of Isaiah but also how the prophet tried to communicate a message to his audience in such a way that it would transform them."
"Positive","Extremely valuable. Covers topics left out of recent texts.: This book is a classic work in the field of data analysis which is often cited in more recent texts. In the present world of Windows, SAS, SPSS, S-Plus, etc., the pioneering work of Daniel and Wood on computer applications to data analysis looks somewhat dated. However, it will repay careful study by anyone who wants to do thorough analysis of real world data, especially manufacturing process data, because it includes topics, such as nested data sets, which are common in industrial data, but regrettably cannot be analyzed by most standard linear regression techniques as presented in more recent texts. It is a very valuable adjunct to books like Draper and Smith."
"Negative","Boring until the last chapter.: Okay so I wasn't very pleased with this book and I'm so glad I bought it as a Goodwill and only paid fifty cents for it. The book was boring until the last chapter which is the one that gave it the second star. Without that chapter it would be a one star book.The book starts off with Mandie and Celia having to solve the mystery of why the bells at the church are ringing the wrong number of times. Most of the locals think it is a bad omen espically when the flu breaks out and a big snowstorm comes. When Mandie and Celia solve who is behind the ringing of the bells they have another mini-mystery to solve. At the end of the book it leaves it open for the next book in the Mandie series.The characters were all okay. The one I loved the most had to be Ben. In the book it is set way back and so the black people are still servants and men seem to be the main provider of the household.Penny Lane"
"Negative","Jolie Blon's Bounce Flat: This is the only book by James Lee Burke that I did not enjoy and I have read them all. He seems to have lost all of his ability to hold a story together. Boring too!"
"Positive","Good suction but heavy: I mainly use this to clean our dogs hair from furniture and sometimes on our bed sheets & stuff. It works very well with my puppy's short hair/fur. Only con is its heavy but otherwise I'm very happy about this vacuum."
"Positive","Awesome Razor Pocket Mod Scooter!: We ordered the Razor Pocket Mod Miniature for our 9 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves it!!! She wants to ride it every day, no matter how cold it is out! This is by far the best gift we have ever bought for her! She also loves the mint green color!"
"Negative","Another self-promotion for the gullible: Let's make this one brief. I bought this book along with a few others because I was following a heated discussion on a sword forum between Clements and another fencing writer. After going through Medival Swordsmanship page by page, I think this is the most self-serving book ever written. The author has little to no grasp at all of the medival sources and his history looks and reads like it was clipped from a supermarket encyclopedia. I won't comment on the endless silly rants on everything not in lockstep with the writer's views. The whole purpose of the book seems to be drumming up business for himself and squeezing profits out of gullible fencers for the publisher. Buy it only if you feel you must to complete your set of worthless overpriced paperback martial arts books. If you're looking for genuine history: Pass."
"Negative","Good for a child: I wanted a book that would give me an overview of US Presidents. This was less information than I had hoped for. I think this would be a good addition to a young persons reference books....maybe get them interested in history. It doesn't have much data."
"Negative","THE DREADED H03........has struck again!: Less than a year later....my LS-50 has succumbed to the H03 errorcode....Panasonic deserves a class action law suit! DO NOT BUYTHIS PLAYER..."
"Negative","Low Budget - not like the books: Hi,i was very disappointed by this DVD Series!If you read the books forget the movies.The battles are looking very unrealistic and there areonly around 100 soldiers.The bridge in this movie is a cheap wood bridge, also there is nosecond battle when the bridge after the bridge has beendestroyed.Even the capture of the eagle is a scene of 2 minutes."
"Positive","An interesting research in a free jazz field: I have known GR in different jazz groups, and even in earlier solo works. I espected to listen a ""classic"" cuban pianist as I knew him. This is a different work, where he explores, in a cuban mood, a more free field. Don't close your ears, but... be prepared. I'm still trying to understand where he wants to go."
"Positive","live over europe: I bought this DVD after seeing these guys in concert on TV.One of the best rock groups I've heard. These guys are better live than recorded you can't say that about to many bands but these guys can pull it off."
"Negative","These are heirlooms?: Knitting for Baby is perhaps a reasonable title, since no one over the age of two would have any use for any of the items shown. Heirloom Projects these are not. They are simple, ordinary, and uninteresting designs, many of them for nonwearable objects I would not waste my time knitting (balls, blocks, a washcloth, for example). Complete How-to-Knit Instructions to me implies instructions for knitting the designs in the book. But no; this book assumes that the reader has never knitted anything at all. More than half the book is wasted on novice-level instruction. Heirloom knitted by novice is an oxymoron if I have ever heard one. From the title, I expected interesting and complex designs worth spending a good deal of time knitting and worth preserving for generations to come. This book offers nothing of the sort. It's a huge disappointment."
"Positive","Must have for a Blu Ray collection: Lots of action, great acting, well written story line. I've never met anyone who doesn't enjoy the Bourne series."
"Negative","TINY: This item was so small, it wasn't worth buying for the price. My dog devoured it in no time. The picture is deceiving."
"Positive","Definitely worth a look...at Jeffrey Combs: Jeffrey Combs is underused here (like he is in seemingly every movie that he is in), but Director William Malone utilizes a great score to keeps things moving at a crisp pace, to hide the warts in the plot (like why anyone in their right mind would go downstairs). This is a vast improvement over the stinkeroo of an original. Not real scary, but if they had used more of Jeffrey Combs as the mad doctor, they really could have had something special.Bonus points for the DVD extras, which are excellent. Why would anyone use VHS at this day and age? Go DVD and see this movie in all of its glory."
"Positive","Highly recommended!: ""Building effective technical training: How to develop hard skills within organizations"" by Rothwell and Benkowski is intended for any worker who must apply devices (such as PC's, software) that ""govern them and their work"", engineers and workers who apply special knowledge in manufacturing settings, and MIS professionals who apply knowledge in high-tech companies. The organization of the book is logical walking the reader through the contents of this resource. Their ""Lessons Learned"" chapter (Part V) is particularly well done. The added bonus of a CD-ROM and Appendices (specifically IV) enhance an already highly useable text making it easier for those of us who straddle both the practitioner and academic worlds."
"Negative","Need an expert to adjust this one: I bought these orthodics thinking that they were the type you put in the oven to heat upp and then simply put in your shoe and step on to mold to your foot. I was wrong. You CANNOT put these in the oven - they have rubber backing that will burn. They recommend using a heat gun and a TRAINED specialist to help mold these to your feet.Stick with the other brands that require an oven - or get a real orthodic. Forget about this one. I cant see heating it up with a hot heat gun and thenmolding it by hand. They really must be kidding. Even with a glove, you cant do it yourself - exprt help will cost several times the cost of this product."
"Positive","fun but cheap: i hadn't planned on buy this but amazon had a deal if you got this with another toy. works great until it falls on the table or floor then the shape will deform and will no longer be balanced."
"Negative","Save Your Money to Buy Better Tongs!: I thought that ice tongs were way down on my spending priorities, so I would just get the least expensive ones. How bad can ice tongs be? I was wrong. These don't do the job - just do not work worth a darn!! I will be now buying the good ones."
"Negative","This game is horrible!: I have never played a worse console flight combat game in mylife and I own PS and N64. I am not a hard core flyer/gamer and amusually easily impressed. The graphics are no better than a mediocre PS game.END"
"Positive","Knowing seb's music: The first time i listen to Seb Fontaine was when i bought the prototype 2, by that time i was amazed by the global underground series but until that moment i didn't knew the real power and emotion that makes me feel prototype 2.A mix of a kind of tech-house, deep house and pure house in CD1 followed by energetic progressive house marks a way thay any dj had done before.Tracks like the one of Warriors of love, Chris Cargo, johan and the classic one of Cevin Fisher's ""Music save my life"" certify that he's leading the way."
"Positive","To Cute: This set looks so cute in our daughters room. We are happy with the style and quality. Sheets did not shrink after washing."
"Positive","microfiber bikini panties: These are great so far but I have yet to try them on after washing. The fabric is silky and a nice quality. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars would be that the seams are fairly thick making them a poor choice for wearing under certain types of pants, like a knit, where panty lines might be a problem. Under jeans they are perfect. I will probably order several more pairs for the high quality and fantastic price."
"Negative","Owners manual in large print.: The book is two books in one: a rehash of the owners manual, but with some errors (like referring the reader to the non-existant metering mode button); and a tutorial on basic photography.If you already know what depth-of-field is and how to compose a shot, and if you still have your owners manual from the D50, save your money and skip this book."
"Negative","Cheesy, useless DVD!: My husband and I just tried to watch this DVD. Luckily we only borrowed the DVD from the library. Save your money. This was easily the worst DVD I've seen on infant care to date. What's up with all the horrible acting and the useless tips and facts? We could barely get through the first 10 mins. This was in utter contrast to The Happiest Baby on the Block DVD that we just watched. That was an excellent DVD. If you want to spend money on a DVD re infant care, spend your money on the Happiest Baby on the Block DVD and don't waste time with this one."
"Positive","The last Hitchcock `s farewell!: Truffaut really looked outstanding with this somber psychological study of the human soul, its affections and reminiscences around the intend of reviving a past passionate love affair, when the casualty face them again. She is his neighbor but he is happily married, though she really does not care about it, because she is living her actual passion as if the time would have suspended. In this state of things this fact is not any obstacle to her.A true gem of the French Cinema that has proved countless opportunities how handle with this issue. Depardieu and Ardant are both perfect: the final scene is simply unforgettable.A true icon picture."
"Positive","I ought to slug those R movie loving critics! ""They don't know entertainment"" as Krusty would say: I do love ""Charlie Brown's Christmas"", a joy for the entire family, young and old. A Christmas play is being directed by Charlie Brown, and everyone is complaining. Charlie is sad because he doesn't know the true spirit of Christmas, and his friend tells him the spirit of Christmas. The play was never finished though.I like this toon because ""Charlie Brown's Christmas"" had the guts to tell about Gabriel telling the shepherds about the Good news that Baby Jesus was born in the manger. I would recommend this to all!"
"Positive","This DVD is BANANAS!: I completely disagree to the previous review. This is by far the best of the HipHopHoneys DVD series! Everything about this one is top-notch. The girls, the music, the guest stars: Redman, Lil' Jon, 50 Cent. The production value is very high, with amazing editing keeping this more like a party/DVD mixtape.You DO get to see tons of girls, tons of parties, all cut together in a megamix. There's a flock of sexy Honeys of many different flavors. Canaila is a fine-ass honey with a crazy body. I looked at Gia La Shay's site for years, she's like the Black Angelina Jolie. This is the first time I've ever seen her on DVD. Some fly ass white and Asian girls too.The Redman parts are fast paced and entertaining. The girls are everywhere and banging. You get to see a lot of the real clubs in Las Vegas too....I will rock this DVD in the ride and at the crib, it's perfect eye candy for a party or just chillin'."
"Negative","Not good...save you money.: This thing is just not good.First, the touch-free part only works if a) the bin is pretty much completely empty and b) the batteries are pretty much brand new. Another words...it rarely ever works.Second, the smell!!!!! Everytime you open it up to throw away a diaper you will be hit with this horrendous smell...and before you think ""well, you need to change it more""...her is our routine. We empty it every 3-4 days. We DO NOT throw poopy diapers in it, we take those out to the garbage in the garage. We change the little filter every month like we are supposed to. We use deoderant garbage bags and spray it down with lysol everytime we change it.So...it's not us. It's the diaper pail. Save you money...this is a piece of very smelly junk.Get a diaper dekor...or better yet, just throw your diapers away in your regular garbage. It's cheaper and your LO will enjoy the ""field trip"""
"Negative","sound block review: First of all, the product does not include the battery and it is hard to put the battery in. After all the effort, it refuses to give even the slightest hint of a sound. Not sure if it is a design flaw or we just happened to have a bad product."
"Positive","Good Read!: I enjoyed this book. My only warning is that one must read it in context of when it was written. In other words, there's no new ground-breaking information in the book, but it was probably all near-new stuff (at least to the West) when it was written."
"Negative","Fell apart 1st time I wore it: Cute hat, but totally useless. First time I wore it the velcro strap came apart. Nice for breast cancer awareness it you are going to use it to simply decorate your room, but as a hat... no."
"Negative","The same techniques over and over and over: The book shows you a couple of techniques. But the same techniques are applied over and over on the different scripts. Not all the techniques work. The INSERT or UPDATE SQL statements would not work if there are too many single and double quotes. For example, try using INSERT or UPDATE with text data like - Mr. O'Brien's girlfriend said, ""Hi, it's me!"". The quotes and single quotes would really mess up any SQL statement. Also, you have to change the connect string to use Microsoft Access, a fact not mentioned in my copy of the book / CD."
"Negative","I hate them now!!!! I wish I could of put 0 stars!!!!: Okay, this toy is SUCH a waste of money!!!!!!!!!! all they are, are plastic and a little metal ball!!!! I collected over 65 mighty beanz, but now I never play with them!!!! And I figured out that I wasted 65$ on those stupid little plastic things, and some of them look terrible!!! like there are some with blood, and some are warewolves,witches,ghosts, and terrible stuff like that!!!!!!!!! SO DON'T BUY THESE THEY ARE A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!! AND SOME ARE BAD!!!!!!!!!!! ( but I do have to say that the caterpillar,horse,butterfly,dolphin,seal, polar bear, and the husky are all really cute. AND I AM GOING TO SELL ALL OF THEM ON AMAZON!!!! SO GET READY, AND I AM GOING TO SELL ALL OF MY RARE ONE'S TOO!!!AWFUL TOY!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE!!!"
"Negative","Nice bag but no room: I purchased an InFocus IN26. Nice bag to store and protect the projector, but has no extra room for cables. I returned and purchased another bag. Amazon was excellent in handling this return."
"Negative","tremendously boring: If you want to hear the same 5-6 notes over and over again for an hour, then buy this CD. After about 10 minutes of listening,and hearing the same few notes, I wanted to throw this disc out of the car!! This CD is irritating at best."
"Negative","Agreed- Do Not Buy This Phone!: Last night after almost 1 year of frustration I took out a big hammer and set about to destroy this phone. It fails just often enough to drive me crazy!! I have missed important calls, been unable to make a call at important times, and spent an incredible amount of time fussing with it to get it working. In case you're stuck with one of these, I found that ""rebooting"" it by unplugging the base helps..."
"Positive","no pain to watch this one: The footage wasn't great but the performence was entertaining, it's better than the DVD from the cynic paradise ltd edition and as close as I will probably get to seeing PAIN live being an Aussie, so for that 5 stars.the 7 music videos that are on the DVD are great as well, the interview was boring, the interviewer really had no enthusiasm and just seemed to read out questions from a list, the Bio and Disco.... well I don't see the point."
"Positive","Waterpik Flosser: The Waterpik Uitra Water Flosser got four stars from me because I like it. The Waterpic has plenty of force. I runthe pic a few numbers short of max. I like the way the pic and tubing fold back into a neat assembly. I've only hadthe pic for a short time so I can't comment on it's longevity. I would recommend this item to a friend."
"Negative","bought the wrong movie.: i think i bought the wrong movie,and couldn't return it because didn,t watch it till return policy was over.did not even finished watching it.i wish you guys can replace it with something better."
"Positive","Dragon ball season 5: Its funny and thrilling in all the dragonballsDragon Ball: Season TwoDragon Ball: Season ThreeDragon Ball: Season OneDragon Ball: Season Four"
"Negative","Not Solid Brass: This product is brass-plated aluminum, not solid brass as the product title indicates. Other than that, it is fine. The product title should be changed."
"Negative","Why even bother get this game when you've got SvR 2006?: Before you get this game. You should know that SvR 2006 is much of better chances for your funtime & giving you oppurtunity for title bouts, good creation characters, & better seasons as well you like it like I do! You will not find good sh*t in this game, trust me. You'll only find this game as an insult to game history of the month! You can't give this game a chance at all even if you're die hardcore fan, this is not for you. Get SvR 2006, it has some particular stuff that you've been wantin to have for years!"
"Positive","great book: This is an excellent book. You really learn alot from going through the exercises and I wish there was more on techniques of matering/mixing/effects processing (I know this is alot) to further develop my skills using Waves plugs.This product was an excellent, excellent idea. I have been frustrated as an amateur recording engineer/producer knowing that I had all of this power in my hands and not really know exactly how to use it other than by trial and error. This product was a godsend. It did a great job at explaining why things were set the way the were. It opened my eyes to a whole new philisophical approach to my recording and mixing. Now I just need to learn how to play guitar better. None of this info helped that."
"Negative","Rent this for a laugh: The notions are juvenile and obviously aims at appeasing teenage girls only, while there is nothing to help boost their intellectual calibre. Of course, it is good for a laugh because the actors are so serious in it!"
"Positive","Deliciously funky: This album is slightly derranged, but in a warm friendly kind of way. Its hallmarks are funky tomtom beats and bizarre lyrics, but beyond that it defies description.The album title is wonderfully ironic - neither the newFADS, nor this recording, can possibly be pigeonholed!Its one of those CDs i keep returning too - a kind of old worn jumper for the aural receptors.Enjoy!"
"Negative","Works fine....while it works: After 18 months, the spring mechanism is broken and the thing is useless. Expensive, nice looking product that doesn't last long."
"Negative","Thought I was going deaf...: Couldn't hear a dern thing with the volume on the highest level. Bought a different phone, I'm not going deaf."
"Positive","Loved: I loved the book and I love all the books by Emily Griffin. If you have liked one of hers you will enjoy this one."
"Negative","Keep HipHop Pure definitely!: Limp Bizkit is okay on rapping but I know that DJ Primo laced the wax perfectly for the track N 2gether now which is definitely the best sounding track on the whole album. I would recommend just getting this track only and rest of it is mediocre because I don't think that the metal element ought to belong in the rap game, ya'll know. Keep hiphop pure!"
"Negative","Disappointing: Here's a great concept: a space ship is found under water that crashed here about 300 years ago. More to the great concept: the space ship is one of ours from our future. It came from our future and crashed back to earth in their and our past. Or you could say 300 years ago a space ship crashed on earth, and was discovered now. Think of the possible outcomes, we learn about our future and whatever possible disasters that will happen, alien encounters, how advanced we become, whatever. What we get is a boring Sphere. It has an effect on everyone making them paronoid and hallucinating, who cares. The sphere contains a child like entity. It becomes a horror movie. A great cast wasted. I was very disappointed."
"Positive","Undoubtedly the best romantic book in the world !!: During this year, I worked for a theater company that played Los Miserables in Spanish (I am Argentinian), and since then, I fell in love with the story. Our play respected the original story by Victor Hugo, so there were no omissions and no inventions. Although I work as the person who handles and controls all the music and mics (it was a musical), I bought the book, I read it and I loved it. It is the best French romantic book in literature's history."
"Positive","A moving work of understated elegance: ""Streams"" is a CD that is so beautifully understated that it draws you into its beauty in such a way that you experience it rather than just listen to it. This first ten songs on this generous work (it is well over fifty minutes long) are by various contemporary Christian artists, with some guests. Michelle Tume's ""Hold On,"" Chris Rodriguez's ""Sanctuary,"" Sixpence's ""Breathe,"" and Delirious? with Amy Grant's ""Find Me In The River"" are among the best vocal offerings -- but every vocal by all the artists is a work of musical tapestry that lends itself to repeated listenings. The orchestral suite is very good, but seems somewhat tacked on as filler. Still, this is one fine CD!"
"Negative","A Testament to the Accuracy of Amazon User Reviews: Before I struggled through Neanderthal, I surfed to Amazon.com to get a feel for how the book was being received by ""the public"". To my surprise, most reviews were generally negative, but I thought, ""well, maybe I'LL like it"". I mean, how can a novel about the discovery of a group of Neanderthals living in today's world not be cool?Well, I was wrong. Dreadfully wrong. Neanderthal is an awful book. Like past reviewers wrote, it was difficult to finish. Like past reviewers wrote, it was pretty hard to believe. And like past reviewers that knew Jurassic Park wrote, it's no Jurassic Park. I really should have listened.So, if you are thinking about reading Neanderthal, take it from me and my fellow reviewers, read something else - learn from our pain. Go get From Lucy to Language and have fun imagining your own neanderthal story - the odds are it will be a lot better than this one."
"Negative","NO LEFTY SETTING!: In shooter games like this I like to use the left stick to aim and the right stick to walk. This game has no such setting making it unplayable for a lefty like myself! BOO!"
"Negative","Useless ...: If you have ANY experience in strength training; this book is a complete waste of time and money."
"Positive","I never ordered this but get to review it anyway!: Gotta love the internet, I never purchased this item but love to review things. How is that any different than professional sports I will never know. Semper fi, never been in the military either......"
"Negative","Avoid being a complete idiot: This is the first _Idiot's Guide_ I've ever bought, and if others are like this one it will be my last.It's hard to figure out what exactly this book was designed to do. It gives almost no helpful information in the actual preparation of a network, but instead focuses (inasmuch as it ever does come to a point) on the nature of networks. Maybe this is good stuff for those facing a written exam in a theoretical course in college, but for those of us in the real world, there's simply not much here. Don't expect that this book will actually help you set up a network.Apparently this a ""Complete Idiot's Guide"" not because it explains how to set up a network in simple terms, but because you feel like a complete idiot after buying it."
"Positive","Don't HESITATE!!!: I'm listening to this CD as I write. This is an exceptional reading of the Grieg by Tomsic, and the recording quality is superb. No matter who you have for the Grieg, get this. You'll thank me. While you're at it, try her Beethoven first on Pilz, her 'A Liszt Recital' on IPO, her 'Chopin: 4 Impromptus, 4 Nocturnes, Fantasie,' her 'Famous Piano Sonatas' (Beethoven) on Pilz, her 'Bach Italian Concerto on Madacy, and her Chopin 'The Fourteen Waltzes' on Point Classics.All exhibit world class technique, with passion when called for and restraint when not. Sound quality on all is excellent."
"Negative","noisy and important: a noisy little thing, you need one for every lens. cause its a help of a job to remove it from a lens to another."
"Negative","Not For Sensitive Skin: I have sensitive skin, but the Philosophy counter people tried selling this product to me for YEARS despite my protests. Finally, I bought it as part of a kit. Every time I use it I break out within 48 hours after! I get REAL microdermabrasions and it's a TOTALLY different experience (in the GOOD way!)"
"Negative","This Is Not Salsa: I have no idea what Cal Pozo is trying to teach, but it's not Cuban salsa. I live in Miami, and I've taken salsa lessons from two instructors, and the dance Cal Pozo does has absolutely nothing in common with the dance I've been taught. For example, the basic step in Cuban salsa is from side to side; you pick up your left foot, step to the left, bring your right foot to the left, put it down briefly beside the left foot, and then you step to the right with your right foot and bring your left foot over to the right. Cal Pozo does some bizarre thing that takes four steps to each side.Pozo teaches none of the ""turns"" that make up real salsa. If you do the real thing, you learn turns called ""Exhibela,"" ""Dile que no,"" ""Sombrero,"" and so on. Pozo doesn't do ANY of these. If you study his tape and then go to a salsa club, you'll look like [funny]."
"Negative","Good Gone Bad: I used to use Select Phone for years to prepare mailing lists. Now, every time I purchase the ""upgrade"" it gets worse. The product was once user friendly and was great for producing mailing lists. Now it's riddled with pop-up ads and is cumbersome to use. The software was supposed to allow me save 2000 profiles but it only was enabled to do 500. After calling tech support I still couldn't get the profiles. Most firewalls prevent you from getting additional profiles. Needless to say it was a huge waste of time ordering this software. I am returning it. By the way, if you register the software and then cancel they will hound you for months to re-order. I asked them on multiple occasions to stop calling me."
"Positive","The New Work of Dogs: Easy reading....A collection of true stories of people and how they are emotionally connected with their dogs - not always to the dogs advantage. Anyway.....recommend it! But be sure to read it all the way to the end - where he offers some thought provoking insights."
"Negative","Not for me: You know a band has become way too popular for it's own good when a plethora of fans will hail b-sides and leftovers not good enough for original albums a masterpiece. I wish I could say that there are good things on here, but there isn't really anything to pick from this carcass. Die-hard fans should buy it for obvious reasons. If there is some poor idiot out there reading about Led Zeppelin and doesn't really know who they are, go and get your hands on album number 2, and forget about this until you are a die-hard fan after you hear their first six albums."
"Negative","Worst Vacuum I've ever owned: I have followed all instructions, I have cleaned the filters regularly and this piece of doggy doo won't pick up the smallest of mess on the floor. I realize I only paid $50.00 for this piece of junk, but you would think that companies would take some pride in the quality of the products they put their name on. I guess if you don't have the budget to spend $500 on a vacuum then you are just out of luck."
"Positive","Abrupt End: I've enjoyed other books by McCullough but was disappointed in this one. Just after describing TR's engagement announcement, McCullough abruptly ended the book. A brief ""Afterword"" describes what happened to the main characters.However my curiosity about TR's presidency, his second marriage, his daughter Alice's lilfe and so on remains unsatisfied.I got the feeling McC wasn't overly fond of TR and perhaps that's why he abandoned the project of writing his bio."
"Negative","Not Funny: Alan Alda is a funny man. But his book is not. He jumps from here to there leaving one to wonder where he is going with his story. Our book club was anxious to read something different but it was unanimous - thumbs down."
"Negative","Nice edition of an okay film: Not having seen this film in 30 years or so I didn't remember much. I bought the DarSky version expecting the film to be your typical rendition of an older, low budget B & W film with a bad print and generally not very good looking. I recently got a 42"" Sonis Bravia LCD TV and have been watching some of my films on them. From Superman (78), The Birds, The Poseidon Adventur, Koyaanisqatsi and some others they all tended to not look as good as I expected. Surprisingly The Flesh Eaters was one of the best looking of them when blown up to fill the whole screen. The photography, for the most part was crsip and clean without much graininess.As far as the story goes it was enjoyable with some pretty decent acting, even with some of the not so great dialogue. A couple funny lines and some corny characterizations add some amusement. The effects, alas, were disappointing if not slightly ambitious for this kind of film."
"Negative","Logitech Trackman Wheel Mouse: This mouse just didn't work for me, and I had to send it back. It feels comfortable, but when you move the wheel instead of the mouse to move the cursor, you can only move it so far, and then you have to lift your thumb and put it back at the starting point to move it some more. In other words, the movement can't be a sweep from one place to another."
"Negative","Return ASAP: Sit 'n spin is too small for my son of 26 months. The sound quality is awful and I decided to not even test the durability...... it will be returned tonight."
"Positive","Converted me to This Genre: This was never my genre, I've tried other authors, but haven't made it through any. However after blasting through this book, I'm looking forward to the next in the series, and then the next.Try it you'll like it!"
"Negative","Disappointing: The book is an honest, yet slow account of travel into PNG's interior. The climactic episode allows for some excitement, but the author's confusing sense of guilt is ridiculous and tiring."
"Positive","Stunned at how good the sound on this SACD: I have many SACDs and DVD Audio discs but none hit me as hard as this one did. I was floored at the sound quality and the perfection of the mixing job for a 5.1 system. I never appreciated this album fully until now. Please get full range speakers for all 5 speakers to truly benefit from these SACD's."
"Negative","Defected Book!: 1 star because the book was deffected!This book arrived on time and was in excellent condition. Upon reading the book to my daughter I noticed the pages were out of order. Please contact me so that I may persue getting another copy."
"Positive","Very musical and adventurist: These videos are great,I first recieved them when I was 3,now I'm older.There are 2 other children that I have past it down to.They both love it,and so does everyone else I know.These videos are great because it keeps the kids bizzy and it teaches them song that even I didn't know.To all those people that are thinking of buying the videos ""Buy Them"" there great."
"Positive","history of pharaohs: This is an excellent introduction to the succession of the pharaohs. It shows each ruler as he or she succeeded the others and what overall contribution of each to the benefit of the kingdom of Egypt. A good history lesson."
"Negative","It made no sense...: ...I watched it at school, and everyone in my class was either sleeping or scratching their heads in confusion. I just don't understand why Spielberg made this movie...along the way, people started talking in random languages (pardon me for being vague, I don't remember WHICH languages) and, well...it was just weird. Why did they? I have no idea. The ending just baffled me...*spoiler* why did he walk onto the spaceship? HUH? Maybe I was just having a bad day, but it really made no sense to me. I was alternating between bored and frustrated at not understanding the 'plotline'.Quite a poor effort, conclusively...this movie was weak."
"Negative","Hard to cut: Unless one owns an entire garage of wood cutting tools, it is near impossible to cut to size. Waste of my money..."
"Negative","Bulova 96E02: I don't even know if these watches are real. I ordered two of them and they both had scratches all over the bands as if they were rubbed against a brillo pad. I went to the Bulova website and the watch model number didn't even pop-up on their site! Also, kinda on the lite side for me. Can someone tell me if these are real or knock offs. Returning both of them!"
"Negative","No Tom Wolfe: Interesting but the comparisons are too facile. Wolfe always had a point. In buying this book, I got carried away with all the hype. How can almost 700 pages be such worthless drivel. The only reason why I'm even giving it the two stars is because I'm in the diplomatic corps and the pop culture references are rather smart. Wait for the paperback, but for a better read, try Hometown or The Girls Guide to Fishing. Shorter and full of plot."
"Negative","Pilot touch screen stylus: I bought this for my iPad (touch screen, right?!?), neither my iPad, iPhone, nor iTouch recognizes this stylus. This product CANNOT be used with any of these products. Very misleading."
"Positive","Fran Better's Fly Fishing, Fly Tying and Pattern Guide: This book was written by Fran Betters, one of flyfishing's best teachers...rest his soul. I ordered this book as used because it is out of print, and it was in excellent condition. I have already marked some of my favorite parts. Thanks for helping me add it to my library of flyfishing intel."
"Positive","A third movie!!!: I don't own this yet but I will be ordering it soon. One thing I can tell you about it is though that one of these so called OAV episodes is acually a movie. Yes one of these is acually the third movie, it's that the style of it was so simular to an OAV that it is confused with the OAVs alot. You will enjoy this product though because all of Ranma 1/2 is good."
"Negative","Started strong but fell apart at the end: I read the first chapter of this book and I thought, ""Wow! This is really going to be a great book"". I was wrong. The first chapter of the book was exciting, well described and emotional. However, the rest of the book was a steady decline from there.In the middle of the book there is an encounter with a dragon. However, it's glossed over and much of the detail is left out. A lot of detail is given in sailing from this island to that island. Personally, I would like to gloss over all the sailing and spend more time on the conflict with the dragon and the final conflict at the end."
"Positive","Brilliant album: Amazingly melodious songs....Cantrell has carried on the AIC tradition and full marks to him for coming out with flying colors....the first 5 songs rock like nobody's business and the rest are worth listening too....good work old man and I hope we'll see another one from u in the not so distant future"
"Positive","It was cool, witty, and, well, funny!: William Powell does a brillaint job in this movie. He minipulates the standard of life in the 1880's. If you're ever to an old theater in England, I suggest you try it. (Oh, gad!!!)"
"Positive","Fun: This is a great learning game. And a great gift idea. Colors, counting, taking turns. Just a great first game for little ones. Instead of a suction cup they need to have a magnet. The fish are easy bent...but overall this is lots of FUN!!!"
"Positive","FANTASTIC GOURD ART BOOK: WONDERFULLY INSPIRING BOOK - I just LOVED it - have studied all the examples and will use them to try my own carvings and paintings on Aussie gourds.THANKS for writing the book.Melody Haskins (Downunder, in Australia)"
"Negative","Outdated information don't buy: The information in this book is outdated even when it was published. I learned more in 2 lectures on patent law while in university. Its has been made obsolete by more recent revisions by the USPTO."
"Positive","Love it: I did a very thorough search of crib mobiles and their capabilities before I bought this one. I am very pleased with the results of this one. The mobile itself has 3 volume settings options (no sound, quiet, or louder), several music options in addition to a ""rainforest"" sound of birds chirping, owls hooting, and crickets making noise (my favorite setting, as it seems to sooth my 3 month old to sleep quickly), an option to have the night light on or off, and various combination options (i.e., light or no light with sound or no sound). The rainforest characters are very colorful and, in addition to the leaves going up and down, the orbital movements of the characters makes my daughter very fascinated. This mobile really started getting the quiet, peaceful attention of my daughter when she was 8 weeks old. Now at 13 weeks old, the mobile still gets used daily as she transitions off to sleep."
"Negative","Very slow in responding to order: I ordered 2 of these pads seven days ago and just today my credit card was charged and the item shipped (hopefully). I don't know what this company's problem is, but the commumication is totally unacceptable. I am writing this review of the company that is selling this on Amazon. Have not seen the pads yet, so don't know about them. Anyway, if you don't mind this lag between ordering and them getting around to your order, go for it. Personally, there is too much competitiion nowadays for companies to hav this kind of attitude towards paying customers. I expected better from Amazon, too."
"Positive","Welcome to the World....: This is a really neat rpg video game. The Storyline is a very simple one. When a 14-year old boy named Kite joins his friend on an online video game called ""The World"". His friend is brutually attack and ends up in a coma. The only clue that Kite has the attack is somehow connected to ""The World"". Now, Kite must search out for other players, who like him want solve the mystery of the world. Before, more players end up in comas too. But, how far is Kite willing to go, to solve the mystery of ""The World""."
"Negative","Not a good Canada travel guide/book: We tried to use this book when travelling to eastern provinces of Canada (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec, PEI) But the book was so dry and shallow that I could not continued. We used guides and tourism information offices and did an improvized trip. I have read a lot better travel ""diary"" books."
"Positive","A must-have for every woman: Stylish, classic, elegant - a must-have for every woman. And also very helpful, guides you through the shopping maze urging not to indulge into seasonal ""one-night"" stands with trendy pieces but stick to more refined basics, true diamonds of the fashion.And some of here sentences, for example, ""A real woman never wears black dress in the morning"", are simply iconic."
"Negative","Ify: It's looks cheap, for 5 bucks (add around 5 for shipping). I've seen a Transformers Movie Keychain of Bumblebee, which looks great, and for 4 bucks, at Toys'R'Us. This is the first product I bought from Amazon's 3rd Party Store that I was not really that satisfied.Kids will surely like this, so I gave it one more star."
"Positive","Nice: Makes installation easier. Its just a pain when u dont need all those wires! I'd be happiest if they had a D-I-Y wire harness, Metra sends the wires & connectors & i install the wires i need into the harness! Pay me Metra, its my idea, & now its published! Works great anyway, other than all the different wire colors from the different companies. excellent that the wires were labelled!"
"Negative","Unfortunate: After waiting for over a year for a new Crusie, Bet Me was a big disappointment. The gimmicky plot was bad enough (A grown man still betting on whether or not he'll score with a woman? Give me a break!), let alone the cloying cutesyness of the unending props, but what really killed it for me was that I simply didn't like these people. With two minor exceptions, they were whiney, immature, bitchy, bitter, and boring. The minor exceptions themselves were drearily smug. Not even Crusie's trademark style can save this one. Too bad."
"Negative","Can't handle a real lens: I used my Opteka monopod 2 times before it broke. I was using a heavy lens only shifting the weight slightly from side to side and the screw from the mount snapped off. I had it longer than the 30 day return period so now I have to buy a new one. I think I'll put out the extra cash for a decent one. I guess I have a hiking stick now. To bad the highest point within 200 miles is only 44 feet above sea level."
"Positive","Alarm works when power is out!: A lot of the battery backup alarm clocks only provide for backup of the settings. If the power is out when the alarm is suppose to go off, you're out of luck. This one is different. It has a backup ""mini-buzzer"" alarm that will go off at the set alarm time even if you have the alarm set to radio. I'm in a situation where I cannot afford to wake up late. It's comforting knowing I don't have to worry about the power being out and the alarm not sounding."
"Negative","Not too sure sure...: I took these for two weeks along with seriously increasing the humidity in my home and water I was drinking. I thought they were working great. But three days ago I simply quit taking the 4 a day I had been taking just to see... And to give myself a break from the diarrhea they cause. I don't even know why THAT ingredient is in there. Not mush use. Anyway I have seen NO CHANGE. In the three days that I have stopped I still did all the water and humidity. So they might help if you don't want to do all that but didn't do me a whole lot if good I'm sorry to say."
"Positive","Great Product!: I have been taking these for about three weeks and feel better than ever! I am over 40 and regularly mountain bike for exercise. I do not have anymore aches or pains that would normally come with this type of activity. I highly recommend this for all.Thanks!"
"Positive","Lots of fun!: My 7 yr old daughter received this doll for Christmas last weekend. She absolutely loves it. The doll talks and asks for things - like her blanket or teddy bear - but she is not annoying or loud. She has an on/off switch my daughter uses when she won't be playing with her for a while. My mother and I even found ourselves playing with her at one point. I would definately recommend this to any little girl who loves baby dolls."
"Negative","STUPID!: I have the whole series on video and I must say this is my least favorite Puppet Master movie.This is not worth seeing.If you loved Puppet Master 4 then you should check this out otherwise stay away from this movie.This movie is the same as Puppet Master 4.Toulon's Puppets battle the killer Totems."
"Negative","Efashions Solutions: This dress is cheap and gaudy looking....nothing like it looks in the photo online. Also the expedited shipping is a rip off...they charged $18.00 for what was Priority Mail...I sent it back the same way and the cost was only $6.20."
"Negative","had it with quirky: Take a stack of 3 by 5 notecards and jot down the following plot themes: quirky minor characters, dying football hero, middleaged friendless visiting nurse, beautiful highschool cheerleader alone and getting old and cool dog. Shuffle the deck and put them in a book. If the setting was Baltimore, you wouldn't know if it was an Anne Tyler book. I just can't take anymore quirky characters. The dying of cancer theme was okay, the romance, doomed as it was, was okay, and the dog worked. But all those insightful though odd patients of hers, helppppp....Ms. Berg is best when describing the simple life of a woman. This time, she gives us an unlikeable heroine who is somehow beloved by all her patients, who attracts the dying love of a former high school stud and who beats out the homecoming queen in a quest for his affections. The one good part is the final resolution when Myra finds out she's worth loving. But oh dear, it takes so long to get there."
"Positive","TO GOOD TO BE TRUE: THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO WRITE TO THE WORLD , I HOPE I CAN HELP YOU SOME DAY YOU ARE GREAT"
"Negative","Expensive to Maintain: I purchased this humidifier one year ago for $40 at Target, and I have spent almost $100 in replacement filters. You have to replace the filter at least once a month, and they aren't cheap. I could have just bought a machine without a filter, and probably spent the same amount of money as I have in replacement filters!I will give this machine credit, though; it is quiet and we use it at least 12-15 hours per day while my daughter sleeps. It doesn't need to be refilled as often as most, and it's compact so it fits nicely in small places."
"Negative","No need to pray: If sleep is your aim, this book will do the trick. I usually love Deaver's work and was pleased to find an older title I hadn't read. Good thing I only paid half price at a used book store. I still feel like I spent too much though, since this was one of the dullest and most tedious novels I've ever read. All of the characters are unappealing and the tension is non existent. I hate it when publishers try to make bigger profits by re-releasing early (and often inferior) works by popular authors. Save your money for Deaver's next book."
"Positive","Very Rad!: I am a guy who does not get excited about clothes or fashion accessories, but these sunglasses are the bomb! They are very comfortible and keeps out the Palm Springs sun. The best part of the glasses, chicks dig them! I got tons of compliments from girls since I got them. Yesterday, I wore them while playing tennis. The glasses filtered out the sun and glare making a lot easier to see the ball. The sunglasses are light, comfortable, and stayed firmly in place while running, bending over while playing tennis. I absolutely love these sunglasses."
"Positive","This book puts life into perspective!: I have never read any of Lamb's work, before this book, and let me sum it up quickly by just saying he hit my heart. Bravo!"
"Positive","Better way to get points: When I run out of points, I prefer to come on to Amazon and buy them either in 1600 or 4000 bunches. I prefer this over giving my credit card info to Microsoft. The only downside to the product is it comes in a blister pack that is a pain to even get the card out. Once you are through that painful process, it is fairly easy to get these points associated with your account."
"Positive","Converted Skeptic: The last U2 album (CD, whatever) I bought was `The Joshua Tree."" Soon after, I was so tired of the hype, I had written the band off. Many of `my' bands from the `80's evolved into soft rock sloths (REM, Sting.) Then U2 pulls it off with `Beautiful Day.' I hated to admit it but I really liked the song, so much so I bought ""All That You Can't Leave Behind."" Trust me children of the `80's, it's great. These guys are the real deal."
"Negative","Nothing happens in this book: Let me state out right that I have read the whole njo and absolutely loved it. I loved the direction, the darkness, the philosophy, everything. This book, and the horror that is star by star, almost made me give up on the series.This book centers around Jaina and throws some Tenel Ka in there too. I'm going to agree with another review I read and say that this book was so estrogen pumped it was ridiculous. It was like reading an Anne Rice novel. Not that I have anything against a woman writing a star wars novel, I love Kathy Tyers work, but it seems way to in your face about the womanhood going on in here and not enough of anything else at all.Literally nothing of interest happens in this book. Jaina turns to the darkside and, surprise, comes back to the light. There, I just saved you 200 pages of boredom and dialogue. There are no battles, nothing. Just boredom.All in all, I say read the summary on wikipedia and pass this one up."
"Negative","Very Negative book: My 3 1/2 year old daughter had to have eye surgery and I was looking for a book to read so she would feel comfortable with the whole process. I thought this would be a good one, but was I wrong! Not only does it put a very negative spin on the whole thing, but it also has the potential to put a lot of ideas into kid's heads. I ended up writing my own book."
"Negative","NO VIEWFINDER: I purchased the camera ..but i ended up returning the camera...I had no idea it had no view finder....I thought all camera""s had a view finder... I will look at the item description closer from now on...because i ordered it, I have to pay return postage..."
"Negative","AutoMeter - FAIL!!!: If I could leave zero stars I would. Ordered this clock. First one came and the knob was broken off the stem. Returned it to Amazon - perfect performance by them. They replaced it with a new one the next day. Second one came, I hooked it up and it was working fine. Then I put in the illumination light and it caused the second hand to stop/jam against the clock stem where you set the thing. Remove the light - it works. Put the light in - it jams. Amazon had been so good about the first one that I sent an e-mail to AutoMeter to see if they had a fix. Yeah they had a fix alright: Fill out a form, pay $10 and shipping. Then they would fix it. Tried to explain that this was their issue and not mine, it was a new clock and the response was fill out the form, pay $10 and ship it. So thank God Amazon has a great return policy so they can give this junk back to AutoMeter. I am going to find a different clock from a different company."
"Negative","lousy knock-off!!!!: I have had this product for about a year now and i only used it for 2 or 3 times. I noticed that the top will not fit the pot! The handle on the side of the pot is loose and the pot appears to be a knock-off!! I am sick and tired of being ripped off by these people!!"
"Positive","Very workable: Received my Aeron Desk Chair, couldn't wait to open and get it put together ~ which was a breeze. A couple of screws to attach the back and it was up and running. The ability to raise and lower the chair so easily is a big plus, as I change positions often when working. Comfort is excellent, ergonomics are great. Smooth rolling. Wish I had had it years ago in my away from home office when I was working full time. And the price was what I was willing to pay. Didn't realize it would be such a great chair at such a great price."
"Negative","Two stars only because of the pictures...: So you think you're a knock-knock joke fan?Well, then I strongly suggest that you don't buy this book because it will ruin your taste for jokes the very minute you open it.I've got nothing bad to say about the pictures, which in fact are quite good.However, the jokes themselves are all ones I've heard before, and most of them are so stupid that there's absolutely nothing funny about them. It's also not nice that the author copies someone else's jokes and puts them in a book titled as her own.Take some good advice, and don't waste your money on this book unless you've got nothing better to do with it. If you're really desperate for knock knock jokes, your money would be better spent on books by David Lewman, Joanna Cole, or Tad Hills."
"Positive","Interesting, well researched, and well written: A fantstic read for everyone- patients and doctors alike!"
"Positive","LOVE IT!!!: This is a GREAT BAG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Perfect for my Canon T3i with the kit lens. I would recommend this bag to all!"
"Negative","A Slow Burn: I agree with Stephanie Lewis: this is an awful book. I like convoluted plots but this was totally lacking in credibility, and in parts was just plain unpleasant. I just skipped through most of the second half, which seemed to be getting weirder and weirder."
"Positive","Astounding: I can hardly find words for this release- I went to the Mp3.com and Turan Music sites to find more information on Voiceless- So far, this is the third release from James Hopkins- Central Musician/programmer/etc of the constantly revolving group- For the last 2 years- Voiceless has been him but in the past it's included Anji Bee (now with love spirals), Kevin Corren & Robert Hazelton (ex-abney park/servitude). Anyways- this cd is simply astounding- The quality is stellar, while keeping the listener captivated.so far- they have gotten 21,000 downloads on mp3.com and are climbing!!"
"Positive","A life changing book: I put off reading this book for years, but finally bought it and read it. I am SO glad I did. It was amazing. It was very easy to read and well written. It did not scare me like I had wondered before I read it. It was a life changing book for me and I have refered to it often. Nothing I have ever read before has stirred me up to reach souls for Jesus like this book did. I found it biblically sound and matching others who have experienced the reality of hell. It gives a strong visual comparison of God's amazing love and grace to us who believe and receive Jesus as our Lord and Savior and those who choose to turn their back on God. The book gave God glory which is SO important. Everyone will benefit from reading this eye opening book."
"Negative","Very disappointing quality: We have owned this machine for less than two years. It simply quit working one morning. The switch is flimsy, but I don't believe the switch malfunctioned. I believe heating element stopped working."
"Negative","Flimsy if used indoors!: We purchased two of these plastic pens..and it was a big mistake! We tried to set them up in the 4 x 6 rectangle dimension and the door sags forward terribly. It is not sturdy for inside use unless maybe if it is in the octagon shape, then perhaps a little more sturdy..but still not worth the money spent. I would send these back to Amazon, if I hadn't opened them. Quality is much poorer than I expected it to be. I wish I had never ordered them...in my opinion they are a huge waste of money."
"Negative","Long on Theory, Short on How-To: This book appears to have been written by academics. It contains a great planning strategies but very little in the way of practical information about how to actually design multimedia instructional materials. The accompanying CD is weak, mostly text and a bunch of supplemental forms and planing document templates. It isn't worth the money if your looking for a ""nuts and bolts"" guide to design."
"Negative","Magnetic Closure Issue?: I like this case, it's really nice and sleek. The only issue I have, well outside of the fact that the strap is difficult to push through the small opening, the magnetic closure seems to be missing, the closure looks like a screw and there's a magnet inside of the case. But I've only had it for a few hours and it looks like the magnetic base is creating a hole in the fabric of the case because of the screw which binds it.Is anyone else having this problem, or is this just a defective case?"
"Positive","Good for new readers: I have played Battletech games before but I have never read a single book this was my first. It did start slow, however that was necessary to set up the story. I enjoyed this book just like all of his others. If you like Talion: Revenant you will like this."
"Negative","A hodge-podge of chapters written mostly by accountan ts.: About half the chapters are written by various accountants employed by Price Waterhouse. Only 2 out of about 20 chapter authors are recognizable names in the field."
"Negative","A very LONG reminiscence detracts from this book: I love cozies and am very fond of the Miss Julia series. I had to lower my rating of this book because there is a 98 page reminiscence in the middle of it that provides nothing new to the loyal reader of this series. That's about 1/3 of the book. Very disappointing."
"Negative","Doen't connect with iPhone using most shell cases: I was very disappointed that the head/tip of this cable is too wide to fit through the opening of most shells - while it looks similar in size to a standard OEM/Apple tip, it's not an is about one-quarter of an inch wider and thus doesn't connect to the charge port on the bottom of an iPhone 4. Very poor design on Belkin's part."
"Positive","excelent services and procduct: excelent services and procduct 100% satisfythe midland it's a excelent equipment, I do not have complaints, I have not even proven it in big distances, until now I have proven it in distances of 500 meters (4 or 5 bolcks)and has worked perfect."
"Positive","a deep, mesmerizing account on the human condition: TOOL, known for their beautiful but angst ridden first three albums, Opiate, Undertow, and Aenima, returns to strataspheric form with Lateralus, a spiritual and artistic journey into the human condition. Like Nine Inch Nails' masterpiece, the Fragile, Lateralus took a long time to record. The music is far more intense than their previous works. this album takes a more psyhological turn, making it more deep in its meaning, basically, the meaning of being human.I really cannot think of another band that that has as much of a deep meaning in their lyrics as TOOL.For most music fans this would be an acquired taste. for those who fully apreciate art like myself, this album is for you."
"Positive","YES!: This book is absolutely INCREDIBLE! IT's excellent!!! Worth a million bucks! My copy has been loved to death. I got it at the same time as Little Women...five years ago...and I thought Little Women was awful because I read this book first and it was SO good. It's sort of like Little Women or an Austen book minus the romance. It's very, very, good and I recommend it highly!"
"Negative","Album of covers: This is not a *new* Vangelis album. It is old Vangelis tracks, produced and recorded by ""A Close Call"""
"Positive","a great military tale: I have to admit my fondness for all military tales -- I loved Dress Gray, and almost every book I've ever read about military discipline. This one though is one of my all time favorites in that genre. It's brutal at times, but a major page turner. Great plane or beach reading -- just make sure no one interrupts you until you're done. As an aside, because of the vivid pacing and compelling plot, this is a great book to give to kids (especially boys) who are reluctant readers. All students I've recommended this book to have loved it."
"Positive","The Court of Two Sisters Cookbook: The history was very inviting to read. I plan to revisit this section before another visit to New Orleans. The number of recipes was disappointing but did have several of the restaurants staples in it."
"Positive","Great for over door stoage.: Great fit for over door, would like to have same stong hanger but longer to hold more cloths. The older ones are longer and hold more clothes but made from thinner materal, this one is thick, strong and good and heavey."
"Positive","Not quite as I remembered it: This is a board book in a much smaller format than when it was originally published, and I think some of the illustrations have been changed, e.g., I remember ""apple"" for A and this has ""aardvark."" However the illustrations are fine painterly pictures. Good to use with younger children, as there is only one illustration per letter instead of a lot of smaller ones."
"Positive","This is a marvelous book about an extraordinary woman: At last, a real woman emerges who is Eleanor Roosevelt. She's been so idolized or hated for so long that it's refreshing to have a real human being written about with real understanding and compassion. Not only does the real Mrs. Roosevelt emerge from the past, but so does the real story of what the depression years were like. Not just selling apples on the street and soup lines, but a dynamic, serious time when we as a nation nearly lost our way. A must read."
"Positive","Facinating, I did not know it was possible: This book is unbelievable, to think that one man could stand that much time alone in that environment. I personally recommend this book to anyone who likes tales of adventure."
"Positive","very punkish!: This sound track is awesome!! I liked the movie a whole lot and it had a lot of punk music in it, so I bought the sound track. It really rocks. The only reason I didnt' rank 5 stars is because one song is not on there from the movie (where Angus dances with that chick at the end). But otherwise it's got a great variety of some good bands like Green Day and the Riverdales. J.A.R. is really a good song and if you like green day a lot, i'd recommend this cd for you."
"Positive","Good starter kettlebell video, with room to improve: This video is a solid workout and a good introduction to kettlebell form for a newby at home for the first 10 minutes. The only thing that would be great is if the 6 sets had markers you could jump to. Even if it was just a list of those times in a discription of the tape - it would help a lot when you're just starting out, and you want to split up the routine over two days."
"Positive","Dalmation Webkinz Dog Virtual Plush Pet: My grandaughter loves this pup. I like the Webkins because it encourages nurturing and the ability to follow up on a commitment.The gift arrived on time in good condition."
"Positive","It rocked because it had Adam Sandler: Billy Madison is the funniest movie in the world and I own a copy and I always give it to my relitives for Christmas gifts and I have an autographed copy of it which I sleep with so I don't lose it or have bad dreams. All in all it kicked."
"Negative","Kevin is a conman: Simple research will make it clear to the inquisitive that this man is simply a conartist. Kevin takes advantage of rational people's distrust of the FDA and pharmaceutical companies in order to make a profit by selling lies. People will defend him because they feel if they admit that he is a liar then they will be turning their back on holistic medicine altogether. This is a shame because they do more disservice than good to the field they are trying to defend.If you really do have faith in Kevin's claims, you still don't need this book. Just cure your cancer with his Coral Calcium. Or your debilitating back pain, pain from arthritis, sciatica, and migraines with his Biotape. At least those worthless products don't refer you to his website."
"Positive","Amazing - not to be missed: It's great to hear Curtis' song, voice and guitar without the strings that clutter his studio work. Excellent disc."
"Positive","Great toy: We purchased this kitchen set for my daughter's second birthday. Six weeks later, it's the only toy from her birthday that she still plays with every day. The one criticism I have is that the sounds are a bit loud (as are many kid's toys - why??). It was fairly easy to put together and so far seems to be very durable."
"Positive","Ponyboy Express: Well the reason i am typing this review is because we read this book in school and i tell you this the best book i have read. Ponyboy is my favorite character because in the book he always told it like it is. The Outsiders realy is a unique book because it shows people how it was back when people got jumped in the streets. I am going into college now and it is a good book to bring with me to read if i get bored. I thank my teacher for assinging the book to the class."
"Positive","Very good book: If anyone has trouble drawing hands, I definitely would suggest this book. My older sister, (a very good artist, by the way) purchased it at amazon.com used. While she thinks a very few of the hand's positions look unnatural, she is impressed with the book.I've had trouble with hands, so I'm eager to dive into this book. Her other books have always helped me. By the way, on reason some people have trouble with Lee Hammond's techniques are simply because they don't buy the supplies she lists! These supplies are very important towards improving your work. The money will be worth it. In fact, I would suggest ALL of Lee Hammond's books. I've seen most of them. If you interested in drawing people, I would suggest How to Draw Life-like Portraits from Photographs the most of all her people books. It covers more than her other book, has everything. The results are amazing. And the techniques you learn here will help you in all future drawing!!!"
"Negative","Missing bolts - WorldTour M.I.A.: I did not receive any bolts with this stand, which came in a bundle with a Casio keyboard. WorldTour has absolutely NO contact information on their web site. In order to get the screws, I will have to haul the whole thing it to the post office to ship it back for a return. SO not worth the hassle. WorldTour, get some contact information out there for your customers."
"Positive","A great DVD, great sound.: This DVD is well worth the money. I've seen them live and actually walked out because the performance was very dismal and the sound was terrrible. Florida 1985, what was I expecting?This DVD has great sound and shows the band as best as can be expected. The layering of images does get annoying but does stays true to the their psychadelic style. They really manged to get a great recording from a live performance. As for the Tom Petty comment, you really should get your hearing checked, LOL."
"Negative","Creepy: I'll just include a direct quote from this book, and let you draw your own conclusions about whether or not you want to read the rest of it:""Marriage was sealed by the breaking of the hymen. The bloody sheet was proof positive that they had consummated the marriage and that the bond was predicated upon the blood itself. What a bond!....The young girl shed her blood on the wedding night. The young man shed his blood in circumcision. He gave his blood to the Lord. His wife gave her blood to him, and both of them were covered."""
"Positive","Nice scent!: I love huggies wipes, they don't fall apart like pampers wipes. They're thick and strong. The scent of these was something I thought I wouldn't like, but it's really very light and pleasant! My baby is 9 weeks old, and they don't bother his skin at all, either, so they're gentle. Can't beat the price, and I like not having to buy so many tubs to throw away, too."
"Negative","An interesting but too long written novel: I read the book in my English lesson at school but it took a long time for me to finish the novel. In my opinion the first 100 pages of the beach were interesting and easy to read. But after this part it becomes boring. The describtion of the several problems in the community are written to long but the different characters trades are described too superficial so it was very hard for me to understand the relations between the Beachers."
"Negative","Misses the Poiunt: BB misses the point. It gives us nearly three hours of mainly clichéd encounters, told minute-by-minute with deadly slowness. The central premise is mostly in the background.Only in the last ten minutes do we see an attempt to show the sense of loss in the decline of the character. But this was so much better done in ""Charley.""What a bore."
"Negative","Not all it seems to be: First this program will NOT recognize the CF cards out of my Nikon D3 camera. Second this program will ONLY recover jpeg & tiff files. It claims to be able to recover raw files from all major camera makers like Nikon & Canon. NOT true, have even uploaded the upgrade and still will NOT help with any file recovery from my D3. I should return it, but think it is too late. So don't buy this if you shoot in raw and hope to recover files."
"Positive","did the job: needed this splitter because i have too many audio devices in the TV cabinet. I would recommend this product to my family and friends."
"Positive","Good bed for the money: Assembly was pretty easy. The bed (especially the headboard) looks nice and is of a pretty good quality. Have slept on it now for a few weeks and it is sturdy. Only complaint is that the bed is slightly wider than my mattress (which is a queen size Bergad memory foam mattress...no box springs). As a result, you can see an inch or so of the unpainted bed slats. But maybe my mattress is a bit non-standard, I really don't know. No big deal, the bed sheets cover it up. Anyhow, I like the bed overall."
"Positive","marvel nemisis: Its a pretty fun game, the graphics are good, the characters are simple, and the fighting arena is almost all destructible; in multiplayer mode. The only flaws are the fact that in single player mode the levels are really easy to beat, and that the characters have almost all the same moves, so there's no surprises. But overall it's a pretty fun game."
"Positive","Awesome videos: These videos are wonderful. I had seen them on PBS, but enjoyed them so much that I ordered them for Christmas presents and one for myself to have in our collection. It is truly amazing what one man could do all by himself in the wilderness."
"Positive","An eye-opener: It often occurs that the movie version of a classic novel differs greatly from the book, but in this case the difference was astounding. The original B&W movie bears almost no resemblance at all to the book. The ""monster"" is actually benevolent and good-natured, and becomes violent only after being mistreated. The novel focuses much more on Dr. Frankenstein's personal struggles with his own actions. Worth reading just to set the record straight. (I read the Kindle German translation.)"
"Positive","Voices in Harmony Book Review: This book was not what expected, however one of the things that impressed me and that I really like about the book is the history it provides of plural marriage - it's roots, the reasons the church denounced it, and more."
"Positive","I love Johanna Lindsey's books!: I can never stop reading a Johanna Lindsey book! I'm eagerly awaiting the next one!!!"
"Positive","Inner Peace: Reading this book helped me to get through a dark time in myself, as well as, learn more about myself, my reason for where I am at and why I am where I am at."
"Negative","Thought I was tripping!: My daughter tried this stuff first and hated it. It made her feel sick but also disoriented. She was trying to read a magazine but couldn't understand a word of it. She gave them to me and I took one before heading off to a meeting. I was asked to take the minutes but really struggled to concentrate to do so. I suddenly felt so jittery and dizzy. I couldn't focus on any object or understand what was being said. I was afraid I would have a heart attack or something. I had a very disoriented and disconnected feeling. Thank God I wasn't driving! This is definately not a good product for many people."
"Negative","Almost killed by dog: The makers of this toy want you to believe it is made for big dogs and rough play. There are a few reviews that seem to back up this contention, so I ordered it for my 70 pound shepard mix. It arrived on a Wednesday afternoon. Thursday morning he was playing with the toy before I left for work when a piece came off and choked him. Thank goodness I am trained to deal with emergencies and was able to clear his obstructed airway. No dog toy should fall apart and become a choking hazard after less than 18 hours of ownership and less than two hours of playtime.If you have a dog stronger than a teacup poodle, I strongly suggest buying a higher quality toy. The cheap price tag is not worth the life of your pet."
"Negative","i simply did not receive it: Why you did not sent me the itens of this order. And why i was not refunded?"
"Positive","Very pretty: I bought theese shoes for a wedding i will be in. They are so nice, and comfy to.the were suprising wide to. I was very pleased because i have wide feet."
"Positive","Works great...: It took a little fine tuning, I guess to accommodate the age of my devices.This one is on my entertainment electronics. I'll be getting another one for my computer.I had originally planned to use a Kill-A-Watt, but just went straight to the smart strip."
"Positive","Rob Marley's Review: This was a great movie about the struggle of a young man from the mainland United States who experiences the harsh realities of the Hawaiian islands and its' culture. The director of this movie used graphic representations of the ""local"" native hawaiian's views on foreigners to depict a society based on drugs, violence, and crime. This however, is not the total truth. Being from the islands, I was able to see the contrasts between what is and is not factual. However, being foreign to the Hawaiian islands might lead one who views this movie to stay away from this paradise. All in all, this is one of those must see movies for anyone who enjoys watching raw, on the edge action about an incredible society in the middle of pacific ocean."
"Negative","Such a waste of time!: This book is the biggest waste of paper. The main character is a self-centered witch (with a B) She poisons animals and people, makes mean comments to her friends and family and doesn't care about anyone. Luckily I didn't waste too much time on this book.This book is nothing like Bridget Jones's Diary. Bridget Jones had a soul and was a likeable person. After the first page, you hate Katya!"
"Positive","sock aid: What a boon to all who have had hip surgery or have trouble bending to get socks on. Mine stays in a handy basket beside my bed."
"Positive","A Great Follow - Up: Sondre Lerche's latest album is definately a great follow up to Faces Down- his debut release. Two Way Monologue has a soft melodic pop sound. Lerche's music is reminescent of the true pop sound of the 60's that isn't heard all that often today. A variety of people will appreciate his music. Check out ""faces down"" and his EP ""don't be shallow."" Lerche is fabulous live as well, i was lucky enough to catch him at the Fine Line in minneapolis."
"Positive","Excellent for Beginners: Having wasted much time looking through a number of other books supposedly covering the same subject, this book is a welcome relief.This book covers in adequate detail the essentials and the basic principles of design, including emphasis, contrast, balance, alignment, repetition, flow, the use of images, color, typography, etc. It gives enough explanation with examples for one to get a good grounding on the subject, without getting too technical, keeping the book highly readable. A part of the book also focuses on specific design situations, including logos, flyers, newsletters, resumes, etc.Perfect for anyone with no formal training in design, but would like to improve his/her understanding of design."
"Positive","Great sequel!: Great movie--good story line. While you don't see as much of Tommy Lee Jones as you did in the first movie, Will Smith does a bang up job and his partner is unexpectedly good as well. We'll watch this one over and over."
"Positive","Only one flaw.: You already know that this charger is good, there's only one flaw:When a completely DEAD battery is put in to charge, the voltage will be so low that the charger will not even see it at all and will not begin to charge it. You then might think that the cell is bad and pitch it when in fact it will be perfectly fine. To solve this problem, put a GOOD battery in next to the dead one and short across the two (+) terminals from the good one to the dead one. This will remind the charger that there's a battery there and it will charge as normal. Being able to tell a dead, unrecognized cell to charge manually via the keypad would be helpful.There are some people with very early units out there talking about overheating. Mine is the v35 firmware, and I've had no problems with overheating. I think they got it right this time."
"Positive","Harry Potter: I have resently finished reading all four Potter books. All lived up to high expectations. They all have action, adventure and best of all a gripping storyline. Each book is able to hook the reader for hours with their exciting and twisting story. I have also read the books which were brought out to raise money for Comic Relief which also had the some enthusiastic and gripping reading qualities as the main books. I hope to enjoy the movie and many more Potter books to come. I recommend everyone to read at least one Harry Potter book whatever their age, but then once you've read one you'll what to read them all."
"Positive","Humor and practical health-maintaining habits blend in a guide: If you hate public restrooms, touching elevator buttons or doorknobs, and go through Purell like a house afire, then GERM FREAK'S GUIDE TO OUTWITTING COLDS AND FLU: GUERILLA TACTICS TO KEEP YOURSELF HEALTHY AT HOME, AT WORK AND IN THE WORLD defines you. Humor and practical health-maintaining habits blend in a guide which identifies just where the germs hang out, how they're passed, and how to avoid them.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
"Positive","Still waiting for the new world, but Ginger exists: The book is boring, and won't be stolen by your wife or children.I would suggest to buy it anyway, if you have a minimum interest of what is a dream made true by a business plan.The world, in my opinion, is still too small to Dean Kamen and his great ideas, but I am from Italy and can see happening something similar to Leonardo da Vinci ..."
"Negative","Piece of junk: Shotty constuction. You get what you pay for. The glass is to small for the ring, and you can actually see the edge of the glass at times. The retainer ring isn't sized right either, it screws in cocked instead of flush. Opticaly it works fine and I will use it till I can get a good multi-coated Hoya or B+W"
"Positive","excellent product: you is excellent product, cooled 10 hours and keeps heat for 4 hours .. The product arrived well packed and perfect to sell"
"Negative","Too condensed: This book is simply too condensed for a novice to negotiation to get anything useful out from it.P."
"Positive","dirty harry collection: A great collection of Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry. If you or the person you are purchasing this for is a fan of Clint Eastwood, then this is the collection for you. My husband was so happy to receive it, we watched the first 3 movies 3 days in a row, unusual for him since he doesn't watch TV much."
"Positive","Dark and disturbing: Intense, riveting look at the heroin business, as cops Patric and Jason-Leigh get sucked into their under cover roles. Look fast for Greg Allman as a smack dealer. But be warned, this movie has got some real unhappy moments!!!"
"Positive","Exactly What I Ordered: I needed a small thermometer for my needs and I saw this one. It's perfect for what I needed. It mounts with the included screw from the rear hook. Both Celsius and Fahrenheit are printed on the product and looking at the thermometer I can tell the temperature as I walk by. Easy installation, simple and it works."
"Positive","Austere Ethereal Beauty: This album needs a few listens to allow its true beauty to unfold.If you are after the lush percussive sensory smorgasboard of Enigma , you will be disappointed.Put aside your preconceptions and open your mind to the pure spare instrumental arrangements accompanied beautifully by Helene Horlyks sublime ethereal vocals . Everything is pared back to a delightful minimalism that sometimes sounds so spacious that the songs seem otherworldly.Definitely a match to the other great works of Delerium, Enigma , Amethystium etc"
"Negative","Rotten Little Green Men: The summary of this book and all the reviews that i read made me think that i was in for a real treat. i was wrong, this book was an incredible dissappointment. i should have known from the over descriptive first sentence."
"Negative","Fan from the 60's: I love Diana Ross! However, Please do not waste your money on this!There is no production theme at all. I can fully appreciate if this album was recorded and never released. It should still be lost. I expected a ""Billie Holiday"" type album. Instead the tracts are uneven and non-satisfying. The worst is ""I loves ya Porgy."" I have never heard such a mess. I thought I would just program the CD player to skip this one , but the remaining tracks were not much better. Sadly, the best place for this CD is in the trash can. Lady Ross has hit rock bottom with this one. Stick to the Motown sound sweetie. You're no Ella, Lena, or Etta. Please go back to the standards I love!"
"Negative","Diluted Eau De Toilette: My wife has a nose for scents, and this Dune is not like the expensive variety which is offered by your sellers. Something just does not smell right."
"Positive","Love the Lodge product, but. problems ordering this continue: I have ordered this 10 inch skillet three times, and have been sent the wrong product each time after I returned the item received (I have received three 8 inch skillets). I have emailed Amazon twice about the mixup, and felt safe ordering it the last (third) time since months had passed. But no change had been made. Perhaps the item is listed under the wrong product number?I love the lodge skillets and plan to find a 10 inch skillet somewhere."
"Negative","1/4 Star is too much: I've owned Coleman gear for years. So it was very disappointing to receive this Coleman queen sized bed and find out that it would not hold air for even an hour.I did not wait to get to a camp site to find out if I had a problem so the air mattress was opened and inflated in my living room for a test run. When properly (not over) inflated, it lost air within an hour. I read the instructions that said it would stretch a little so air was added the second night. Again it leaked off within an hour. DO NOT buy this product. I'm sending mine back for a refund. I was told that K Mart had a good camping mattress - Northwest Territory. Bought it and it works great. Better valve and no air leaks! As always, make sure your tent floor is clean and free of things that could puncture the mattress. I've slept on the Northwest Territory mattress three nights. Sleeps great. No loss of air."
"Positive","An excellent read with a somewhat weak ending.: I was fully expecting to give this book a five star rating; it was one of the most enjoyable reads of all the Next Generation books I've yet read. Unfortunately, the ending was rather weak, and somewhat out of sync with the rest of the story; a story as lighthearted as this one shouldn't have had such a downer of an ending. But the ending wasn't terrible; it just didn't live up to the rest of the story, and cost it one star. It's still an excellent story, even with a less-than stellar ending.In general, this story was somewhat reminiscent in style of some of the best of the Original Series episodes, like ""Trouble With Tribbles"", ""A Piece Of The Action"", and ""Shore Leave"", in which a significant amount of humor is added to the mix, without sacrificing any of the action or drama of the storyline. The plot moves well, is not implausible, and the characterizations are handled with a deft touch. A very enjoyable book."
"Negative","Junk-: Purchased two of these for wife and myself. Mine for use with iPhone4 and wife's for iPad. Niether will stay extended, they snap back to stored position. Way too short unless you were to carry iPhone / iPad in your shirt pocket. LOL Impossible to use when they snap back to stowed position, they sound fine if you want to manually keep them extended and chance losing an eye on snap back."
"Positive","Tanita BF680W: The scale arrived quickly and in good condition. It was simple to program and very user friendly. I believe it to be very accurate after I tested it by riding my trainer for 45 min without drinking any water. The weight only is a great addition over the last one I had. I hope this one last as long."
"Positive","Good deal: PROS:-cheap-light-portable (just make sure there's enough space in your bag and not much stress or you'll damage it).-laptop runs about 95% cooler than on the flat table surface-extremely well designedCONS:-the foam material doesn't seem strong. Seems breakable with decent stress.-two back foams are beginning to depress ever so slightly after 1.5 weeks of use.The main reason to buy it is because it performs superbly.The main reason you might not want to buy it is that it isn't very durable. The foam will depress over time especially if you have a heavy gaming laptop and it might break if packed tightly with heavy materials.A $7 investment to increase the longevity of your hard drive and other critical laptop components is a no-brainer."
"Negative","this guy's the worst.........: Can anyone get this bozo to shut up? He's so goddamn annoying, and he seems to be getting worse with every new album.Stop supporting this moron, people and listen to some real music for a change."
"Negative","Sorely disappointed: This was on my wishlist for a sometime. I love salads, but hate trying in vain to dry washed lettuce with a mountain of paper towels. I finally had enough and after once again perusing the reviews, ordered what I was sure would be the answer to my wet lettuce woes. When it arrived, I immediately gave it a test drive. I was skeptical about the spinning action (as it didn't seem fast enough to be able to really spin dry), but I was still hopeful as I rinsed some lettuce, tossed it in, and plunged away. Some of the water spotted the sides of the bowl, but most of it remained on the leaves. I recalled some reviews advising throwing in a paper towel or two for drier lettuce, so I did. Still no cigar. The paper towls remained dry and the leaves wet.I simply don't understand how this product has garnered such positive reviews. After sufficiently frustrating me, this salad spinner went right back to amazon and I'm right back to drying lettuce by paper towel. Sorely, sorely disappointed."
"Negative","Irritating and pointless: After reading the first three pages of the introduction, I thought ""this must get better"". I skipped to chapter 1 and read two more pages of vague, disconnected repetition. So I turned to Amazon reviews to see if it was worth my while to persist. It isn't. On to the next book..."
"Positive","Great: Purchased the movie as gift. It was an exceptional hit with her and her friends who have watched countless times. Great service."
"Positive","Works as advertised: Had an old Dell laptop that needed WiFi connection, and this item was the answer. Installed easily and works well."
"Negative","Blah: Was boring and couldn't even keep trying to read it. Not my taste of reading at all. I wouldn't recommend it!"
"Negative","EQUIPMENT DOES NOT WORK: I AM UNABLE TO GET THE CAMERA TO TAKE ANY PICTURES OR TO EVEN POINT TO AN OBJECT TO TAKE A PICTURE. THIS WAS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR MY HUSBAND AND I FEEL IT WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. I ACTUALLY DON'T EVEN GIVE THIS PRODUCT A STAR"
"Positive","Works great: This heater not only looks nice, but it warms up the room on a cold day. (Keep in mind that I live in Florida and instead of putting on the heat to get the chill out of the room, this unit does the trick.) It runs very quietly and I feel very safe while it operates."
"Positive","Yay: Perfect service, however, the product doesn't work with Vista. I should have looked more closely."
"Positive","The Great Jim Garner and his TV Show of 1974: see Rockford review for movie collection..Great entertainment . Note loaded with cast members that were just getting started in their profession. See if you recognize them!"
"Positive","An epic moment in the history of an enslaved people: Just what sort of a man was Toussaint L'ouverture? Was he a violent revolutionary or a Saint? Perhaps the answer lies somewhere between the two. In any event, he was to be the man who would inspire the Haitian Revolution; the only successful revolt of slaves against their colonial rulers. The book masterfully chronicles the history of San Domingo from 1789, to the establishment of an independent Haiti in 1803. It reveals the intrigue practiced by the differing racial groups and the often unlikely alliances they formed in order to gain or maintain power. How France came to lose this jewel in her colonial empire is clearly explained - a defeat brought about not exclusively by force of arms. The book is a must for any reader who desires to know how a man with vision and courage can inspire an unquenchable thirst for liberty in those without hope."
"Positive","The most wonderful Story of Foxes: Hunter's Moon is the best piece of animal fiction i have ever read. People say it's the Watership Down for foxes, but i think it's even way better than Watership Down.Garry Kilworth has written this story in such a way that it really feels you become a fox when reading it. Also, he explains in detail the way foxes see the world, and how they came into existance.This story is very sad in certain places, but there are a lot of funny parts too, and it's always very exciting. Not only fox lovers, but anybody else won't regret reading this book."
"Negative","This book is NOT for kids: This book is written for grown-ups, not for kids. A relative read this book to my children because she found it so funny but my 6-year-old told me later that the book made her feel ""sad"" and that the ""mommy didn't like her kids."" The story is about the mom being annoyed by her kids who were trying to share their accomplishments her. Their efforts were ill-timed on her part and she shows no tolerance for such. In fact she seems to show contempt for their efforts to connect with her. There are much better ways to address a parent's need for time away from their children. From a child's perspective, this book is just not right. I would not recommend reading this book to kids."
"Positive","Worked perfectly as advertised.: Worked perfectly as advertised. Keystone connectors from a different vendor plugged into the inserts without any issues. With the 2 inserts mounted in a low voltage double gang ""old work"" box located in our bookshelves next to the fireplace, and using the Keystone connectors, I used 7 of 8 position for CATV into a Comcast cable/telephone modem and telephone out to the house telephone distribution panel, CATV in to a Comcast cable box, and 4-Cat 6 Gigabit Ethernet cables out from a 4 port Cisco WIFI/Gigabit router to another Cisco WIFI/Gigabit router (in bridge mode) and 3-Gigabit ports in other rooms. Best of all the installation is very clean and unobtrusive and matched our freshly painted bookshelves perfectly."
"Positive","Great product: Beautiful little piano and easy to put together.The stool was a little difficult to construct and required us to use a drill as the pre-drilled holes were not aligned. Tats the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars."
"Positive","Excellent new but traditional flamenco: El Torta has a wonderful rajo voice, and proves himself to be a master of many of the Jerez styles, especially the various Bulerias. Moraito provides first-rate accompaniment. One of the best recent flamenco albums."
"Negative","So boring, filled with pointless minutiae, far too broadly scoped: This book drags on forever, not telling you much you couldn't get by reading the newspaper with any kind of regularity. I was not impressed. I like non-fiction and books like this are right up my alley. But when I heard the title GHOST wars, I thought there would be something NEW or secretive or something... this is just basic information that most educated people already know."
"Positive","Great weight, but a little large: I got the black and orange version of this gun for playing Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2009 since playing with just the Wii remote was painful. I'm not an avid gamer, but I enjoy them. I'm also not a hunter. The Perfect Shot has a great weight to it and I found the action to be pretty good. Any delay could easily be attributed to my reaction time and unsteady hand. My only problem with this gun is that the grip is just a little too large for my hands. I'm a male that would wear a size large or extra large glove. This gun made playing the game enjoyable, despite the slight pain from the size of the grip."
"Positive","Enough: As a survivor of domestic violence, this movie is one of the best so far that portrays the life of the abused. It would be an excellent movie to use in domestic violence training. The part they left out is the emotional/mental abuse portion and the build up to how she left, but that is so hard to show in a movie and keep the audiences' attention. Jennifer Lopez did an outstanding job as did all of the other actors. I highly recommend this movie to assist in the education of all people on domestic violence. There are so many untruths out there concerning this topic, and most victims are afraid to speak out."
"Negative","Company would not accept ""return"" for correct size.: Before purchase I contacted company about correct size of ""cap"". Was told that ""they"" do not accept returns. I had to guess about correct size. Upon arrival cap was too small. Company would not accept return for size larger cap. Will not order from this company again!!"
"Positive","Awesome deal: This buy is great, especially for the price. I've had it for a 2 weeks and I know I will be buying another 60 pack sometime in the next 2 months. The only problem I had was the mailing took a while to get to me. I expected it to be here in 3-5 days, it took almost 2 weeks."
"Positive","The Years Best Film: In my humble oppinion this film is the best of the bunch this year. I also loved private ryan, but this is a more elequent, complex movie that is not for all tastes. In my oppinion, it is a work of genius. I was enthrawled with it all the way through. And like L.A. Confidential from last year, it is a shame that the thin red line didn't get the respect that it deserved. A terrific achievment!!!"
"Positive","Most Used Knife in My Kitchen: I currently have four Shun knives, all frequently used in my kitchen. This knife, however, is used multiple times each day. I find that the size and weight are perfect for almost everything. It makes slicing large onions, delicate herbs, and sticky cheeses a breeze. While I do go with smaller paring knives for a few tasks (peeling, garlic, and coring primarily), and my larger heavy duty chef's knife for larger tasks (gourds and squash, quickly getting through large bunches of greens, etc), I've found that this knife is really the right size for everything else. I have small hands, and find that the angled construction makes knife tasks a lot easier and more comfortable for me.I would recommend this knife for anyone thinking of venturing into Shun knives. You will be amazed with the smooth cutting ability, and the fact that this is such a versatile knife will allow you to justify the initial cost. Well worth it."
"Negative","1 star for the marketing...: i had thought the 2nd, bonus CD the raison d'etre of the re-release of L A Woman. (the disc is an offering wonderfully strange, eerily so.) until, that is, i discovered on the www news of some accompanying celebration to the enterprise. it would seem that there is/was a 41st anniversary 'party' complete w/ video filmed in venice, CA. excuse me, ""Venice""? what the video shows bears little to no resemblance to Jim Morrison's Venice. (i write as an erstwhile citizen of Venice pre-gentrification--albeit short-term and post Jim's residency.) to include Mr Morrison in this doors celebration then, i think that additional scenes would need to be added, perhaps super-8 slides of Venice in the days of the oil fields. Days, too, of the original Venice beats--the painters & poets.so, yes, although 5 stars for the music's re-release, 1 star for the package deal."
"Positive","Revisiting a Dance Hit from the 1990s: Campy dance act Army of Lovers won't ring any bells to mainstream listeners, but they did have an infectious club single in 1992 called ""Crucified."" Silly if not borderline blasphemous, ""Crucified"" is a definite guilty pleasure of a song that was well embraced by clubheads back in the day. Imagine Andrew Lloyd Weber set to a drum machine, and you may get the general idea. On this single, we get a variety of mixes; the best of these is the DNA remix, which gives the original version a welcome disco thrust. Add Army of Lovers to Technotronic, Robin S and Right Said Fred to the list of guilty pleasure dance acts of the 1990s."
"Positive","Exactly what I was looking for!: The enclosure was exactly what I was searching for. I needed a discrete place to place my garbage cans outside. It was a little shorter that I had imagined but perfect for the job."
"Positive","Octavian's review: Very interesting topic. They provided a very useful view specially for those who are interested in revealing the mind mechanisms and implementing them. It's a very good book for students and PhD-s also."
"Negative","What happened?: This was my go-to Oolong tea for years (thanks Subscribe and Save!). But something has happened in the past few batches. It's literally tasteless now - I've had white tea with more flavor. I just tried the Yamamotoyama brand (available from Amazon) and it's a much better alternative - smooth and toasty."
"Positive","For Those Who Appreciate Real Guitar Picking Talent: Great Collection! I listen to this over and over. It's relaxing, excellent sound quality. Interesting liner notes. Well Done!"
"Negative","Head Cruncher: I wish I could put into words the disdain I have for RAP. But I can't so all you get is the title. Music????? Don't make me laugh."
"Negative","Has George lost her touch?: I have been a fan of George for years, and was hugely disappointed when reading ""With no one as witness"". The whole serial killer thing (code name for Self, symbolism, thinking of Himself with capital letters, profiling etc) have been done god knows how many times before - and so much better! It was just plain embarrassing to read Georges description of Fu's mind.The plot was not very believable either. Serial killers, copy cats AND random killings, and an incredibly boring and illogical investigaton.The main characters seemed a bit... out of character (shallow, boring, depressing) and the rest of the staff, like miss Ulrika - well, I just didn't care, whereas normally, I find one of Georges strenghts that she makes you curious about the involved persons. You care about them, even when they are suspects."
"Positive","Excellent to Show Off Your Display: I am not going into the content; from the specifics of the criticisisms you can tell whether you will nonetheless like this film; that's the advantage of detailed critiques; it's not whether you agree with the taste of the critic, but you can draw your own conclusions. I think that the harshness directed at this harmless if somewhat indulgent personal movie is disproportionate and out of place.I am posting to tell those of you into your home theater set-ups that this is a decent movie to show off clarity and color without having to show snatches of theatrical films. There is enough on here, especially in the first 30 minutes of the longer version, to satisfy the eye (and the mind).POSTSCRIPT: the advent of blu-ray (don't know if this one is available in that format) makes this review obsolete. You show off your set-up with blu-ray, not DVD."
"Positive","Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry: Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry is an amazing book about African-American races. It is also about the Logan family and their land. The main character's name is Cassie Logan. Her brothers are the other main characters, Stacey, Christopher-John and Little Man. I liked Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry because it had such a strong message. The message was people are the same on the inside even if they aren't the same on the outside. Even though this message doesn't come right to you in the beginning, it is still as strong. I also liked this book because it was just so good! What I mean by that is that I liked the characters, the setting, and the plot. I definitely recommend this book."
"Positive","Happy Vacuum person from VA: Well, I love my little Bissell. We have a huge vacuum cleaner which is pretty new and, though it is power driven, it's bulky and I get blister from it. I am small and my hands aren't large but it's the massive size that bothers me more than the weight. It works fabulously but it's a pain to get around (and I weight train!). So my little Bissell is great to use on a daily basis and I need something on that basis with three children (including an almost 10 month old who is finally starting to eat solids). It does a decent job on the carpets and cleans the hardwood floors well so I can swiffer after without the worry of crumbs, paper, long hair, pencil sharpener shavings etc.I am about to invest in another and in the bare floor steam vac."
"Positive","Great Playard: This is a wonderful, playard with plenty of room to move around. It is great when little ones are beginning to walk hanging on because this playard gives enough room for them to do so without fear of them getting hurt. Great for mom while she is busy because there is ample room for toys or nap time. Little ones loved the colors, which can also be a teaching tool. Easy to pack up and take with you to someone else's house, the park etc. It is well made and a product that I would purchase again."
"Positive","Captivating!: This was one of te most unusual Victoria Holt books I have ever read. You don't really like the heroine, and yet you do understand her. This book reminds me of a saga - you go on this journey with the heroine throughout many years of her life. There are some captivating characters throughout and this is one book that I will never forget."
"Positive","Great documentary of an American phenomenon: I was pleasantly surprised by this well-rounded documentary that takes the viewer along on the band's final(?) summer tour. Almost no time spent on the band itself. Examines a good cross-section of heads which include a t-shirt vendor, medic, bootlegger, families on tour, young heads, old heads, a VW bus mechanic, and many for which there is no classification. Shows us the warm fuzzy side as well as the ugly side of the scene. If you were there, wish you'd been there, wish you were still there, or just want to know what this scene was all about, check out this video."
"Negative","Yaaawwwwnnnn: Yet another waste of paper from Ms. Parker. She has nothing new to say except that many poor people are lazy. I think we know that since there are lazy, dishonest people in all classes of society. Also, unless you went back in time Ms. Parker, spare me the plantation analogies. Their is nothing in modern day America that comes close to the horrors of plantation slavery. The title is an insult to the sufferings our of black ancestors."
"Positive","great product with a great price: great product with a great price. 2GB is big enough for many pictures. And the package comes with TWO sticks."
"Negative","its'not goonvery very bad the book.: i'mnot spiking english but a shiping este book end son puras hojas copiadas realmente no VALE LOS 26.20 Q PAGUE POR EL ES UNA MINIATURA THE BOOK DEBERIAN COBRAR 2 DOLLARES POR EL MEN.I DON'T BELIVED IDON'T TO RECOMMEND.I SORRY ."
"Positive","amazing music: I had the pleasure of seeing Shawn in concert a few weeks ago, and I was mesmerized. His heart and soul come through in his music, and you can tell that he is deeply affected by everyone he meets and has a great compassion for people and their experiences. He has an amazing voice, great guitar skills, and his band is great too. Soul's Core is amazing - he goes from soft ballads to rocking, spirited songs. It's hard to put him in just one category - some of his songs have a country tone, others don't - he's an amazingly versatile artist. The bottom line is, if you like good music with honest, soulful lyrics, you'll like Shawn Mullins."
"Positive","Better understanding: If you have ever been confused about Reformed theology this is the book you need to read. It is well researched and very understandable to anyone, even the simplest of us."
"Positive","The Sweetest of Symphonies: This album has it all. Utterly gorgeous. Bittersweet Symphony serves as a classic opener, complete with luscious strings. A perfect video clip to match too. Don't try walking down a busy city street while listening to the song. You'll start trying to imitate Ashcroft's negligent and arrogant swagger.While Sonnet is sweet, The Rolling People and Come On are epic, angry, arrogant songs that just make you wanna sing out loud and just go off. It's an adrenalin rush in your ears....Lyrcially, the songs are deep. Ashcroft is a fascinating lyricist, and his sentiments in Weeping Willow and The Rolling People are endlessly intriguing.70 minutes long, but it's a soaring sensation. Every song has merit, even Neon Wilderness that is pivotal to maintaing the perfect flow of the album.A must have for any one who likes British rock. One of the most important albums of the 90's..."
"Negative","It didn't last: The product didn't last more than one winter, and cost a lot more than a similar and much cheaper product that I can buy at Walmart. Sure, it came with a guarantee, but who wants to waste time on things like that. I just threw it away when it failed."
"Negative","Works ok, nothing special: These do give you a little boost, to me it felt about the same as a cup of coffee. They've made me a little queasy so I use them only when I'm really feeling sluggish. Can't really recommend them."
"Negative","Bottom rusts: Pan works well but the bottom rusts where it touches my pan. This has damaged my pan. Do not recommend."
"Negative","IT STINKS!: Unfortunately, the title of this piece of garbage shares the same name of one of the greatest punk bands ever.I got half way through it, turned it off and sent it straight back.The video makes a futile attempt to analyze the San Diego band. Since they can't get their hands on any copyrighted material, the video contains no music by Blink 182, no concert footage on Blink 182, no interviews by Blink 182, and certainly no relevant information that would have a Blink 182 fan held in the slightest bit of remote interest.It's shotty handheld, homemade camera work, horrible lighting, worthless editing and dry narration only further encourages the viewer to find a nice quiet area in the back yard and put it out of it's misery.Don't let the cover fool you. It's the only thing of professional quality about the video.Trust me. Save your money. Buy the Urethra Chronicles 1 & 2."
"Negative","The game is full of bugs.: I just installed Battlefield Vietnam and spent about two hours playing it. I really enjoyed 1942, but Vietnam is a huge disappointment. It has some very annoying bugs that make the game play extremely poor, like invisible walls that you cannot move or shoot through and usually gets you stuck and/or killed. Floating medical cabinets that you can't get to. Flags that remains white because the timer is stuck (even with no enemies around).If you really want this game, at least wait till the price comes down and definitely wait till they have a couple of patches out before buying the game."
"Negative","Different Pan: We originally got this pan as part of a set as a wedding gift several years ago. The surface coating of our original pan had worn through in areas and we decided to replace it so that our eggs would not stick during breakfast. The replacement pan behaves totally different than the original - dug the old pan out of the trash ... it still works better than the new one. Same model number, looks identical but sure is disappointing. Our guess is that it is a cheapened version of a previously excellent product. Very disappointed...certainly should not be considered an omelet pan ... everything sticks... a stainless steel pan works better and is easier to clean (also way less expensive)."
"Negative","A Mormon's Comparitive Study: One look at the chart accompanying this book was enough to tell me this book was not what I had expected. The chart indicated the Mormon church was the ""true"" Christian church and all others including Catholic and Protestant were in apostacy. Look elsewhere unless you adhere to Mormon beliefs."
"Positive","Good...smelly too: These condoms work very nicely! Extra sensitive and probably the closest thing to going in without a condom! However, these things do stink and smell like a lambs butt - hence it's lamb intestine! It's def worth the try and who knows, maybe you and your partner won't care that it smells! The good can outweight the bad in this situation."
"Positive","And now in living color.........: Tom Bianchi has been successfully producing collections of the male nude for some time now and in most bookstores across the country they are the best sellers of any in the genre. I think there is solid reason for this. Tom celebrates the male image and does so unabashedly. While many other fine genre photographers emphasize the composition, the inner beauty, the interaction between the model and the photographer, the case for light and shadow concealing and revealing, Tom consistently goes for the joy of living, of interacting with friends, the gutsy good humor and good times of just a bunch of men frolicking in the nude. Refreshing to see. In ON THE COUCH the setting is consistent - the oft mentioned leather couch which, knowing Tom's sense of humor, is rather an homage to the infamous 'casting couch' or 'therapist's couch.' All things condisered this is a happy book, filled with beautiful men in rich color. Reading and revisiting it is a joy."
"Negative","get what u pay 4: Listed as a refurb. Cost <$30. Dead battery. Had to buy another battery for $10. Caller ID doesn't work. Phone itself rings and works."
"Negative","Only lasted 2 1/2 years before the light assembly cracked!: I keep my home at 78 degrees,so I had to take the heater out as I could never get the aquarium cool enough. I clean it every 10-14 days,and the water stays crystal clear with a wall of bubbles,air stone,(not a wand which clogs). All the pet shops carry the system 12 filters.I get the 3-pk for $9.98 which you change once a month,rinsing the filter out when cleaning the tank,in between the monthly.After the light assembly in the hood developed many hairline cracks and one quite wide crack. I gave my fish to the pet shops and put the aquarium away,for possible critter use for my granddaughter in the future,but I would not recommend this hood and light fixture for any aquarium!"
"Negative","thanks paul: seen clips, but decided its a waste if its that retarted headache inducing ADD editing, iots too bad , they are a great band, but that type of editing ruins everything, after all this is VISUAL"
"Negative","Love The Simpsons, hate this game!: I'm a diehard Simpsons fan, but this game is just so tedious. My brother in law has this game on XBox, and it played really well, so I bought it for my PC, and it's just bad. The handling is bad, the movements are really jerky, and the missions are impossible! I'm at level 2 and I've already had to skip 80% of the missions just to make it this far! I wish there was the option of choosing a difficulty level and a wider variety of missions. They just seem to repeat, and I get frusterated very easy. If I could, I would return the game and just play it on XBox at my brother in law's house."
"Positive","LIFE LESSONS: I enjoyed this book. I don't like to read so I miss out a lot but having the books on CD makes it possible for me to enjoy a good book. This book was very helpful to me in all aspects of my life."
"Positive","Does what it says~: I have SUPER oily skin. If i put anything on my FACE the oil just POURS out.. i used many kind of things to control my oil leak.. this actually does the WORK!! thank God! because my face is oily.. it doesn't work as long as it would but still does! so if your face isn't as oily as mine DEF buy it! *TIPS* if you think ur face is oily as mine one way that i've been doing with this is wash face-> moisturize-> Mary Kay oil mattifier on problem areas-> face primer-> bb cream/ foundation / whatever you do on ur face XD. that actually works REALLY great! it lengthens the time the face stays oil free :D... at least for me"
"Positive","Bigger than it looks: No doubt this watch is good value for the money but it looked too large on my wrist. It would help to have actual dimensions of the face and band width."
"Negative","Thumbs Down: What a waste of money. This bra gives no lift. This bra doesn't give nice clevage. This bra is not comfortable. This bra's cup size was too small, though it's my normal cup size. The only thing this bra did was cover my nipples. Don't waste your money."
"Negative","Complete disappointment!: This album doesn't resemble Rammstein at all. Where is the powerful guitar riffs I remember from previous efforts. There are way too many ballads on this album. Rammstein has sacrificed its musical integrity for a few potential hits. I mean this album is beyond bad. I would rate it 0 but Amazon doesn't go that low. Anyone who gives this album a good rating clearly hasn't heard their old stuff. I refuse to purchase the next album by this sell out group."
"Positive","A GREAT COMBINATION: Briar Rose is a wonderfull storie combining fairy tales, history, romance and even a touch of mistery. Jane Yolen puts a surprising twist on the storie we all grew up with, Sleeping Beauty. No one is to young or to old for this book, I recamend it to all ages."
"Negative","ReStockIt did not follow thru with return promise: ReStockIt sounded concerned when asked to return this item (item did not match description). However, I did not receive return authorization by mail as promised. While the product is not a terrible rip off it fell short and reseller ReStockIt did not come through to return. I can't recommend purchasing this item unless your willing to accept less than what is advertised: Sierra Leather-Like Zipped Organizer Starter Set, Classic: 5-1/2x8-1/2, Black AAG99381"
"Positive","DVD - Andrew Rieu - Christmas Around The World: Delightful DVD! However, the caption words at the bottom are difficultto view and read to know what he is saying - unless you understand German.Marion"
"Positive","Sex, Nudity, Death....: Kind of like Roman History turned into a Rock N' Roll Music Video. Big name stars, lots of dancing, naked women, costly sets and, yes, a horse. Not for kids. Let's face it, a unrated movie, in which Penthouse took part in making is not something some adults should see. And DON'T even pretend you're watching it for the history. HBO's ROME kind of gets some of it right, when it comes to daily life. But this movie is like using the Smurfs to explain the Dark Ages. Don't even pretend it has anything correct. Just watch it. Enjoy it. And don't think too much about it."
"Positive","Awesome Television!: I love this television. The picture is un-believable and the apperance is very stylish also. It was very easy to hook up and it has multiple inputs for DVD players, digital recievers and your PC. Sharp really has a good product here."
"Negative","They melt in the dishwasher: They say dishwasher-safe, however, they melt in the lower rack of the dishwasher (the only place they fit). They were ok until dishwashing."
"Positive","Love ""The Gift of Love"": I bought myself and my mother this book for Christmas. I havn't read much yet,but I am sure I will love it. I was impressed how quickly I received it from Amazon.com.DonnaBig Stone Gap, Va."
"Negative","I would have picked zero stars if it was an option: Sorry Jewel fans, but this book is bad. Worse than bad. A serious waste of the trees that were used to make the paper that went into this book. If you think this book is any good you need to consider the fact that you probably dropped out of community college because it was too hard, and if your father hadn't paid for your braces you wouldn't even have that waitressing job at TGIFriday's. I shutter to think of how many copies this book sold, because that number reflects only a fraction of the number of complete morons walking around today in the U.S. This book will some day be in exhibit right next to the New Kids On The Block Christmas Album in the museum of the downfall of the United States. And Jewel, if you're reading this, please do us all a favor and go back to living in that van in Alaska. The future depends on you."
"Negative","Not worth it: I just recently unpacked and began assembling this item. It is of unacceptable quality. The castings are especially poor. I had to file and sand them just to be able to assemble the product. The fence is not straight. The hollow chisel I tried first is so soft that the set screw used to hold it in puts a dent in the chisel.I knew this unit was made in Asia, but I thought Delta would hava a little better quality control. I bought mine just before Christmas and didn't see John's review but I am with him and am returning the unit. I intend to buy a mortiser but this one is inferior! Thanks"
"Positive","Remixed Magic: Wow! Wait until you hear this remixed and remastered Mind Games CD. You will not believe your ears. Mind Games was always a favorite Lennon album for me, even on vinyl. But I always felt some of the tracks sounded ""muffled"", especially ""Mind Games"" and the classic rocker, ""Meat City"". Well, crank up your stereos!! Now all these wonderful tracks sound crisp, clear and loud. You hear instruments and vocals that were lost in the original mixes - they were there all along, we just could not distinquish or seperate. Now the songs are full of wonderful sounds and harmonies - and in real stereo. I went back to the orignal CD issue to compare, and indeed many of the tracks sound like they were recorded in mono the seperation was so poor and volume so low.This is a great Lennon CD and Peter Cobbin (Re-mix Engineer) at Abbey Road Studios has worked his magic once again (he also re-mixed the Plastic Ono Band and Imagine CD's). Just Fabulous!"
"Negative","Incorrect specifications.: The specifications say this item is OVER 1"" x 1"". The wire channel would actually be able to handle one coax or HDMI cable, and a couple of small gauge speaker wires at the very most. It is small, the interior diameter is smaller than my pinkie finger. Product returned."
"Positive","Monumental!: Providing possibly more giggles, guffaws, chuckles, and chortles per page than any other important literary creation this century, Catch 22 has the potential to become one of those rare works whose legacy will live one forever. Indeed, Yossarian lives!"
"Positive","Obscenely original: I stumbled on this record because of the obscure and kind of brilliant operation called Rag and Bone Shop, and discovered another obscure and brilliant little nugget with this one. (I'm also pretty sure this is the guy who was the drummer on John Linnell's solo record, State Songs.) Donato's voice is a cross between Rick Danko and someone else from the sixties whose name escapes me now. The words are weird and heartbreaking. The melodies are kind of indescribable, but make me think a little of Elliott Smith and Elvis Costello. ""Biohazard"" is ridiculously catchy and if people actually had taste out there, would be an instant hit. Another song, ""My Purple Heart"" seems to be about impotence and is kind of hilarious and terrifying at the same time. I'm already waiting for this guy to come to Chapel Hill sometime soon, but I wonder if he has the money to tour."
"Negative","MODULE/BULB: Length:: 0:30 Minsanother product bought that is defective .... the bulb is not centered in which it gives you a dark spot where the beam is pointed and this is the second one i bought from amazon.. and they are both suppose to be streamlight ? my question how in the heck did they get passed QUALITY CONTROL .. ? I WORKED IN A PLASIC PLANT FOR 10 YEARS AND AND TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS ON THE MARKET IS UNEXCEPTIONABLE !!I AM A SET UP TECH/SUPERVISOR/QC...."
"Negative","Not a fan of this flavor: I like the Carb Rite brand and have tried three of the flavors so far, but this one is definitely my least favorite. The coconut one I love love love! The consistency is fine, as is the nutritional value, but I cannot get past the taste. I do not taste graham, I do not taste marshmallow - how is this a ""s'mores"" flavor? I really can't describe the taste but...not so good. I bought a 12-pack and had to force myself to eat them all."
"Negative","Hide 'N NO Seek Care Bear: I bought this product for my daughter's 4th birthday. She is an avid Hide 'N Seeker, and I thought this would give us a break from always being the ones who had to hide. I should have read other's reviews first, and I never would have wasted my money. The bear almost always tells you that your warm or close. I found the only way I could get it to tell me I was cold was to go outside. It does not live up to its claims. Please don't waste your money on this one!"
"Negative","Not the Rapunzel You Remember: My children and I just turned off Scholastic's video retelling of this book by Paul Zelinsky. (beware of spoilers ahead) Rapunzel was always a simple story to me. After watching the video, I looked up the tale of Rapunzel and discovered that this retelling by Zelinsky aligns with the story the Grimms told. If your child loved Tangled, I wouldn't read them this story--particularly if they are very young. In this retelling, the prince finds Rapunzel in a tower. One day when the witch comes to see her, she asks her loosen her dress because it was too tight. The witch responds that she's a wicked girl and casts her out into the wilderness--where she gives birth to twins! This retelling was not at all what I expected and wouldn't recommend. I love fairy tales, but we're going to pass on this one."
"Negative","eep!: Well, I heard some good things about this movie. I heard it was funny and action-packed. Well, when I saw this lousy excuse for a movie I was totally disappointed. The acting was awful, the plot (?), was well, I really, couldn't find a plot, but I did see plenty of babes and explosions. The fact that it was based on an awful television program from the SEVENTIES, should be a warning for all wanting to see this overhyped piece of tripe."
"Negative","OK, but not for everyone: YES, I GAVE IT ONLY 2 STARS! I have read alot of motivational books in my life time but this one leaves you empty. Patt Summitt does not give a ""one-size fits all"" approach to obtaining Life's goals as she suggest. Pat Summitt gives these long drawn out stories of her coaching experience and players experience then, at the very end, ties it to a generic principle of leadership that has been rehash by hundred of other motivational book writers. I'm not hating on her leadership or abilities. She has proven herself a dynamic coach. If you're a HS/college couch of any sport then this is the book for you! but for the rest of us her approaches to leadership do not necessarily translates to pearls of wisdom."
"Negative","Pretentious and Contrived: This book is definitely not for everyone. It's not for me. I bought it after reading several positive reviews. I wonder how anyone can describe this overwritten nonsense as 'brilliant.' The author read from it last fall, and freely punctured his reading with railings about life in the U.S.A. (he thinks it sucks), how much he is underpaid by his publisher, and how stupid he finds most Americans. I wouldn't care, except that he rails on and on in this novel about stuffed-shirt pomposity, then openly indulges in the stuff himself. More tedious rants from this writer: how he finds most college students to be ""dumb"", how his novel is ""literary"" compared to most murder mystery trash which is published today, and why he had such a small turnout for his reading. Read this book only if you want a good yawn!"
"Negative","Brutal: This book may be a good supplement to advanced fluids majors but there is no description of the mammoth equations used in this text. I bought this in 86 for my aero course and never used the book."
"Negative","Don't Waste Your $: It doesn't work at Starbucks or any coffee shops, it only works with your home, your friend's home, your work (if it has WiFi) & some hotels. Save your money & buy a $10 headset for your laptop."
"Negative","Not a great sailing book more like ""self-help afloat."": I really didn't like this book. This isn't so much a book about sailing as it is about marrige counsuling. I never could warm-up to the members of this cruising family and the author's non-stop soul searching was embarrassing. The descriptions of the couple's loving making positively made my skin crawl--yeech! On the whole if I had to go sailing with this family I'd stay home.t"
"Negative","Yuck!: Don't let the lovely cover of this book fool you!!! I hated it. This is one of the most disturbing books I've ever read in my life!!! I did finish it cause I kept hoping it would get better at some point. I threw it away as soon as I did finish it, (and I have to admit that throwing a hard cover book away is something I DON'T do.) It is SO depressing!!! I do NOT recommend this for anyone unless you're down in the dumps and looking for something to depress you even more."
"Positive","LOVELY: The scent, the lather, the smoothness of my skin from this product was amazing!! Will buy it forever!! Wish it came by the gallon or something...went thru it very quickly!!"
"Positive","Pleasent Surprise: I have had this story for a while and have recently started reading it to my daughter. The real surprise was that one of my favorite and most talented authors was the writer! This is a great ""bed time book"" for all children. My daughter ""sings"" the story with me.As always, I was VERY impressed! The art is simple yet elegant and fits perfectly with the overall theme.I call this another win.Thank you to BOTH Savas!"
"Negative","Dead Batteries: Most of the batteries are dead or barely working. i needed 3 and i had to go through 9 of them to find 3 that worked."
"Positive","brown rice crackers: well, be nice if they had brown rice crackers with sea veggies to give them a more salty flavor....or at least use sea salt. but couldn't find those. so...these are thin and crunchy and tasty and gluten free and reasonable enough price."
"Negative","Real or Fake?: I'm not sure but, the cologne I bought doesn't seem quite right. Even the title on the bottle seems wrong. Shouldn't it say ""eue de toilet"" on the front? Or something like that. It seems watered down. Not as strong."
"Negative","Returned item: Might have kept this item, but the LCD was so bright it interferred with my sleep. there's no adjustment for brightness."
"Negative","What a horrible musical, what a horrible soundtrack: I saw this musical last year in London and could hardly contain my laughter due to the terrible acting, terrible story line, and equally terrible music. The soundtrack will make a nice white elephant gift for those who suffered through this one with me."
"Negative","Complete Disappointment - Don't Buy Season 3: We purchased Seasons 3 & 4 of Blue Murder based upon our experience with Seasons 1 & 2 and the actors/characters which are rather interesting. Season 3 is a complete rip-off!!! Only 3 stories on 2 DVD's!!! A complete rip off!!! The stories were OK in themselves but the 2nd DVD which contained 1-story and a documentary on behind the scenes trivia was a complete rip-off as far as I'm concerned. Season 4 is the last edition (to include this fiasco) we shall purchase. For how expensive these British mysteries are you'd think they actually would give the viewer an actual story/mystery to watch."
"Positive","Fantastic! Life-affirming!: I loved this book. Yes, it is on the hippy side of things; yes, the photos look kind of funny; and yes, the language can sound kind of silly. However, I've never read such a beautiful and spiritual description of childbirth. The mindset descriped in this book is wonderful, and it also contains lots of very valuable information as well. I just adore it! I'll be reading it again and again. Wonderful book!"
"Negative","Instant Oatmeal: Product not the same contents as have been purchasing in local co-op for the last two years."
"Positive","His Songs Do Sound Exactly the Same.......: They all sound incredible. My girlfriend got married this summer and she and her husband played Flying Without Wings at their wedding as clips of her and husband played on projector. It was amazing and everyone was so touched. Ruben's voice is beautiful and the way he delivers the song Flying Without Wings is so powerful, it moves your heart, makes it do a happy dance. Superstar is excellent as well, Ruben gives his own smooth touch to that song. I'm looking forward his full CD and I want each and every song to sound exactly the same and that is incredible. After all, his consistency and sounding ""the same"" each week is what got him the title of American Idol."
"Positive","Great Cd..: I love this CD, this is my favorite CD from Angela Spivey. However, I hate that is difficult to get your hands on a copy, and there are no electronic copies. They made a poor decision with the distributor for this project, but the music is great. Good luck finding a copy at a reasonable price."
"Positive","wonderful: I enjoyed this film immensely! It stayed not only ""true"" to the book but, was perhaps even richer. Producers and actors did an outstanding job in bringing this story to life ,thanks. I will enjoy it many more times I am sure."
"Negative","Not Great, Not Horrible: OK, it went straight to dvd and basically it's a rip-off of Goldie Hawn's film, ""Private Benjamin"", but it's not really horrible and there are a fews laughs. As for Jessica Simpson's acting, well it's no worse than her singing. Faint praise to be sure."
"Positive","Great 80's movie brought to the modern days visuals: The action scenes are top notch. If your looking for a well placed story and jaw dropping dialog, this isn't the movie. This movie is Bada$$ action, campy one liners, and huge 80's stars mixed with a couple of todays top stars. I won't spoil or talk much about the plot, but i will say, if you want a cool fast paced action movie thats fun, this is it!"
"Negative","Frustrating: This pillow was a waste of money. One, the shape. I can't figure out why it is this bizarre curly cue shape, personally I think sleeping in it feels confining and uncomfortable and prevents any kind of easy movement. Second, as echoed in reviews, the cover they sell you for it is extremely scratchy and uncomfortable--made of very cheap material. Third, the foam used is of the cheapest grade possible and actually feels like it pushes you out of the pillow because it is overly dense and springy. I am used to memory foam which contours to your joints and is more orthopedically sound. This foam feels like its trying to push against you and push you out of the pillow, which, since the pillow is a big curly cue and trying to stick you back in--feels very uncomfortable. This pillow felt like a vice to me. After one hour it wound up on the floor and I was back with my other three pillow pastiche solution."
"Positive","Fantasic, fresh and interesting: Anne Bishop is one of those are authors who can find a strange new world to write about describe and make a story out of. The place and time the charcters she describes are all fascinaitng and ensnarng a book I couldn't aford to put down. A must buy."
"Negative","Nightmare Movie!!: There was nothing redeemable in this movie. It was just one long dragged out flick. The acting sucked, the story line,(not one to speak of). Just an all around snooze fest;which is what I did. Save your ends. This was a biiiig disappointment!!!"
"Negative","disapointed Motorcraft DY1081 Oxygen Sensor: well look at the pic i see three separate wires... i received one thinking that this was a complete set for my truck maybe the picture should be one wire.. so now i have to buy the rest of the parts only recv.1 the wire on left"
"Positive","MAGICAL: To call BEING JOHN MALKOVICH a work of genius seems inadequate. Kaufman's script is so strikingly original, and Spike Jonze's direction so adroit it restored my faith in Hollywood. The cast from John Cusack, Cameron Diaz ( in my favorite Diaz-role ), John Malkovich, Catherine Keener, and Orson Bean, are terrific.The only experience I can equate this movie to is my first bungey jump. You'll laugh, you may even cry, but you won't be bored by this film."
"Negative","Please enter a title for your review: This show is an unfunny one-trick pony. Basically the equivalent of Itchy And Scratchy from The Simpsons. Each episode runs for one minute, contains no dialogue, and always involves the cute little characters being maimed or killed in some horrible way. I didn't really know what I was getting in for with this show. I like Aqua Teen Hunger Force and South Park, so I figured it would be worth checking out. I was expecting some more substancial characters, plots and jokes. I don't know how this could actually make anyone laugh. If you're a Family Guy fan you'll probably dig it though."
"Positive","cane salk plates: I was very pleased with these plates made from sugarcane stalks..They had a nice solid feel, no need for two at a time even with it loaded up. Happy with th price too. And it met the requirement to be recyclable at our Hudson River Pumpkin Festival."
"Negative","Causes horrible stomach pains and constipation: I had to stop taking these vitamins because I would run to the bathroom in the middle of the night with severe stomach pains. It also caused pretty bad constipation. It may the level or form of iron but I had to switch because I could not tolerate them. I tried splitting the pill and taking it twice a day but I was still miserable. I switched to New Chapter Prenatal Vitamins and they are far better. I have more energy and no digestive issues with the New Chapter brand."
"Positive","The Best Boston Band From Lowell Ma.: I had the pleasure of seeing this band so many times i can`t count. Due in large fact that we share the same home town.Innocents was this bands crowning accomplishment, Alas it was also their swan song. I am still completely blown away by `Strata` and `Freak Law` these two tracks alone are worth the price of the cd. Only Living Witness--Innocents,is a blend of of explosive music and thought provoking lyric`s that at times is like a baseball bat to the skull and at other times is like two baseball bats to the skull.I dare anyone to find a better sounding recording then Innocents,the guitar sound is so rich and powerful and is blended together with the vocals to raw perfection, backboned by one of the strong -est rythm sections,that is so flawlessly tight and puncy,it would even make Tool a little sick.Also check out the bands other release`s..This band never released a weak album..I Swear to the god of rock n roll!!!.."
"Negative","Too quiet / mute switch hard to use: This Plantronics M214C headset is one of the few items I've ever returned to amazon, its that bad. With the volume cranked all the way, this headset was still too quiet to hear the other party. Also, one of its big features turned out to be a dud - the mute switch! Its very hard to slide, requiring two hands - one to hold the controller, the other to slide the switch. Makes it impossible to pop in and out of a conference call quickly by toggling the mute switch. I ended up getting aPanasonic KX-TCA60headset instead and its FAR louder. I don't miss the lack of volume or mute controls on thePanasonic KX-TCA60as those buttons are on the handset."
"Negative","might as well use a purse!: Boy, you read these reviews and most of you guys sound like you outta wear dresses. I'll take my 10 year old 21 Oz. Dalluge against any of you guys and well race for pinks, 20 8d galvs in a plywood break - 6"" O.C.; or first one through a box of 16d's. That is if your poor elbows can handle it and you are not too fatigued to make it up to the roof. Seriously, any hammerhand knows that good corrugation (""milling"")and balance is the key to efficient nail driving. Any hammer knowadays flattens out in a matter of days, even if you only pound nails. Of course I favor legislation that would make it a crime to use a hammer on a catspaw,other metal tools, on concrete, or on any other surface not made of wood or nails. Drop my skilsaw, cut my cord, but abuse my baby Dalluge and you got trouble. Unfortunately, they don't make em like they use to."
"Negative","Don't buy this router: People are having tons of problems with the WRT54G Version 5, just try googling ""WRT54G Version 5"". For some reason this version does not play well with DSL. I installed it and it cut my connection speed by 2/3. Tech support was absolutely no help and it took a full hour of wrangling to get them to issue an RMA. Not sure what they will replace this one with -- probably just another of the same that also won't work."
"Negative","Does NOT work with SDHC cards: Be aware that this card only works with some SD cards. It does NOT work with the more widely used SDHC cards."
"Negative","Not What I expected: I just receieve this ""Yoga"" CD and was really disappointed. It is more like working out CD (not real yoga), quickly quickly alternating movements one after another without any breathing or pause. Each yoga movement should be done at least for 3 seconds. Here in this CD, he is rushing: one movement after the other. No time going into each pose...This is not yoga...I am not enjoying these exercises at all. Also, level 1 in the CD is not really level 1 yoga level...Level 1 is already assumed for the experienced users...It is concentrated on losing weight, but ...this is not yoga...it is speeding up weight loss workout...Very disappointed...Would need to return the tape."
"Negative","Does not fit 11 inch plates: The manufacturer states this cover will work on 11 inch plates. It only fits plates 10 1/4 inches in diameter. Otherwise, it seems to be made well enough of a hard plastic material. If it is seated correctly on a plate, it is slightly less than 2 1/4 inches tall. This may be a little low for some foods."
"Positive","perfect: Seamless, prompt delivery despite a heavy snowstorm that delayed shipments all over the state. This a great device for most students and will suport them adequately through high school and their first years in college."
"Negative","Choices - A Disappiontment: I hate to give a bad review but... ""Choices"" was a BIG disappiontment. ""Choices"" is about a disabled high school athlete, (played by Paul Carfotes) and his girlfriend Carri. (played by Demi Moore.) I am all for rooting for the under dog but please... This movie is so bad it put me to sleep.When I went back to watch this movie a second time I was still very lost. ""Choices"" is suposed to be about a disabled athlete and his girlfriend. However, I did not catch on to what the the problem was until the movie nearly ended.All actors did an ok job given the weak story and dialogue. One actor I was impressed with was, Victor French, of ""Little House on the Prairie"" and ""Highway to Heaven"" fame. Of all the cast, I think victor gave the strongest performance. Victor's performance is also the reason for my two star rating.In my opinion, spend your money on something else. Chances are, this movie would be collecting dust in your collection."
"Positive","Emo Driven: Face to Face is one of the most driven punk bands out there. They're definately more emo driven than albums like ""Big Choice"", ""Don't Turn Away"", or ""Over It"". They're quality of emo is incredible. Everyone of the songs on this CD were voted for over the internet. The inscription on the inside of the CD cover ""This is your album"" rings completely true.They write exactly the way you feel. The lyrics for songs like ""Hollow"" will make you think that they wrote the song just for you.Face to Face will definately go down as one of the timeless bands in punk history."
"Positive","Thanks : ): I just got it brand new, good packaging, and no marks. It shipped/arrived really fast (7 days) with super saver shipping. Great book need it for a class."
"Positive","Four disk season four: I believe this is the season that the writer's strike affected. Although the quality is exceptional when played through a PS3 (up-converts to near bluray high def quality), there are only 4 disk for this season. I have the other three seasons and they contain as many as 6 disk ..... Curious that the number of disk seems to be independent of price."
"Negative","You CAN judge a book by its cover!: With the twin pillars of the cavernous porch and foliage overhanging the upstairs windows, the grand house looks just like the face of a venomous serpent with fangs and shifty eyes.:shudder:Vipers warn before striking, and perhaps this book serves as a warning, too. Someone with generations of arrogance and callousness bred into him should never hold power."
"Negative","WA I & II for dummies written by dummies!: I have to agree with the past couple of recent postings! THIS BOOK WILL IN NO WAY PREPARE YOU TO PASS THE EXAMS! Trump one up for Bill and his gang at Redmond for taking our money and laughing all the way to the bank. Save your money and look elsewhere!"
"Negative","Unimpressed: Take this book and send it back! It is not worth your time or your money. It does do what it says it will, it's as simple as that."
"Positive","""MAGICAL--MUSICAL--INSTRUCTIONAL--WONDERFUL"": This is a ""must see"" video for anyone who enjoys brushpainting. It is a wonderful journey into the art of Sumi-E painting beautifully demonstrated by Yolanda Mayhall.Magical Japanese music draws you into the journey and sets the tempo for the marvelous brush strokes that create the Four Gentlemen of Sumi-E. You are guided through Bamboo, Crysanthemums, Plum Blossoms and Wild Orchids as Yolanda shows you how to load and control the brush so that you can create your own works of art.""BRAVO"" FOR THE BEST BRUSH PAINTING VIDEO I HAVE WATCHED."
"Negative","Unwatchable and barely listenable: Sorry - there is no forgiving the editing of this DVD. It is in a word infuriating. There is no way to connect with the living, performing musicians on stage ""captured"" (presumably) by the cameras. The editing is an object lesson in how to wreck performance footage. I find it hard to believe that the creative forces behind Iron Maiden talked themselves into this massacre of the footage.Add to that (or subtract rather) that the sound is thin and I guarantee I will never watch it again. I didn't even make it thru once. This product should be taken off the market and redone. Period."
"Negative","Commonweal Magazine: For a lengthy review of this book written by Marjorie Steinfels O'Brien in the prestigious magazine Commonweal, go to the magazine's archives. The review is truly sui generis !"
"Positive","Would Like to Hear More of Her...: This Cd contains three songs. ""Whenever You Need Somebody"" is my favorite because of it's meaning and her presentation. I heard the song years ago, so when I saw this cd on Amazon, I immediately purchased it."
"Positive","An Honest Look into the Heart and Mind of a Chronic Dieter: If you are looking for a book that will give you insight into the heart and mind of someone struggling with an eating disorder then read this book. It is insightful, honest and heartfelt. It contains practical advice on analyzing your eating patterns, behaviors and thoughts that can begin to help a person struggling with an eating disorder to start down the road toward recovery and healing. The author challenges the reader to take a deep look inside and get to the heart of the matter, which is our own self image. And not just how we see ourselves but how we think others see us too. I recommend it for anyone who is wrestling with any type of eating disorder. You won't be disappointed."
"Positive","I love dermablend: I have been using dermablend for years. I have Discoid Lupus, and I was left with very dark marks on my body after the rashes healed. I have been so self-conscience about the unsightly marks. When I found dermablend I was excited that I was finally able to wear my cute short sleeve tops and short skirts again. I mix two colors: caramel and medium. The key is to moisturize your skin before applying. Make sure the lotion is dry,then apply. I dust a little powder on first to get rid of the wetness of the lotion, then I apply the makeup evenly using a little and adding more as needed; a little goes a long way, and dont forget to blend the edges. I let it set for about 5 min, then I dust it with powder. I can swim with it and even shower and it doesn't come off until I use soap. The one con is that it does rub off on your clothes a little. I don't have any problems getting it off in the washer, but if you are trying to do a spot treatment it is hard to rub off."
"Positive","An album with a sense of humor: If you're a Jewish girl, Catholic, Gay, Religious, or live in Southern California you may well be offended. But if you have a good sense of humor, you shouldn't be. One again, Frank shows us how to laugh while blowing us away with his great arrangements and mind-blowing guitar playing. This is not the definative Frank Zappa album, but does give you some insight to his brand of humor. For more serious musical appreciation of this gifted artist, try some of his other numerious works."
"Negative","Had to return: The dvd was mislabeled with the wrong zone. It was listed as Zone 1 but when I received the dvd it was marked for a different zone that I couldn't play in the USA. I had planned to purchase the same dvd again but the price had more than doubled and tripled. Needless to say, I was very disappointed especially because of the misleading information given on my original purchase. The movie itself is a very good story with excellent acting; humor, romance, and fantasy all rolled into one. The special effects are realistic. I would recommend the movie for anyone who likes fantasy type stories such as Harry Potter or The Lord of The Rings. It is that type of genre and very well done."
"Negative","Eh...: I will say that this was a positive, family friendly movie with a good message and happy ending. However it was not very interesting, at times predictable, and suffered from some over-acting. The plot was a little far-fetched (no pun intended) but, as I said before, ended well."
"Positive","Kiwi Sloggers brighten the day!: I had a pair of these Sloggers for ten years.The soles are now worn smooth and are too slippery in the wet grass.I purchased this new pair at a price cheaper than the original pair. The new color selection was nice .Love the Kiwi green color.I originally purchased a Size 7 that was a bit small with a low cut sock. However the problem of not giving a five star rating enters here, as they are not available in half sizes.I usually wear a size 7 1/2The size eight is a bit too large but a heavier sock helps and my toes are not cramped after wearing all day.They are easily cleaned and look great for years.Much more supportive than other clogs.I am a Master Gardener and I love these Sloggers."
"Positive","My favorite CD of all time!: Caution! This CD will take you into another dimension of kickassness that is so insane you won't know what to do next!SLIPKNOT FOREVER!"
"Positive","An Old Fogey Becomes a Fan 2: I'm also an old fogey raised on Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, The Who, Neil Young, Van Morrison, Yes, Rush, Elton John, and the list goes on. The most recent rock group I latched onto was Counting Crows. I listened to ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" with my 10-year-old online and we both liked the song. I toyed with buying the CD for quite a while, but (and I hate to admit this!) I didn't do so until after the Grammy Awards. Wow, what an infectious set of tunes. The concept of the CD is interesting and the music is fabulous. I know some ""true"" fans think Green Day sold out on this one, but I like it nonetheless--and I'm a music fan who never liked sell outs either! I gave the CD four stars because it hasn't been around long enough (i.e., hasn't stood the test of time) to determine if it will become a classic. However, it certainly has great potential and seems headed in that direction."
"Positive","Nice Glasses: I like this set of glasses. They are solid glasses. I like the price. I just wished there was a 24 oz glass in the set."
"Positive","Gobsmackingly good....: Cryptonomicon will demonstrate to you clearly how pedestrian and formulaic virtually all other books, film, and other entertainment have become. Continually surprising, brilliantly evocative both visually and emotionally, and frequently hilarious. I loved it when it came out (though like others I had a hard time slogging through some parts) and upon rereading it recently found myself even more astonished. Combined with the Baroque Cycle (with which it is inextricably intertwined) it now comes to, what, 4000 pages? And yet I, for one, cannot wait for Stephenson to continue the saga."
"Positive","Animals: This is a cd that you can listen to everyday!It never gets boring.One of the best Pink Floyd."
"Negative","Outdated, bias, full with prejudice and lack of analysis: This book is one of the most bias and harmful books ever written on Latin America. The only reason for his success would be it was written in the midst of the Cold War, with the support of all the comunist propoganda. The book have no depth and lacks the most basic historical, economic and social analysis. Written by a bunch of second-rate writers, it hardly scratch the surface, limiting itself to play the victim's role some leaders like Hugo Chavez are trying to play today. There're many serious books out there to waste time with this one. If you're interested with the subject, maybe you should start with a history one, like ""The two empires of América""."
"Negative","Tonys Waiting For #2: Tony Hawks Pro Skater is a cheap buy.You love it for 2 days then you get bored.Thr aren't enough things to do, you can't do ""literly"" any tricks.If you wan't a good skatboard game get Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2."
"Negative","A Disappointment: Being a repeated watcher of their Complete Works of Shakespeare I was really looking forward to this. I could get past the cast change, but for obvious reasons, they saw fit to just bring everything to a screeching halt in order to go after George Bush. Besides rooting this DVD in our current time (how relevant are jokes about Richard Nixon today?) it just went on and on. If you are expecting a companion piece to their previous brilliant work , then give this a pass."
"Positive","Far more than adequate: Kids on a plane. What more do you really need this for? It does that job quite nicely and works as advertised. No complaints. but the cost has gone up $100. Why, when a newer model is now available?"
"Negative","This is not science, this is superstition: Michael Behe argues that you have complex systems that will work only if all the components operate at once. He argues that you could not get such a thing from ""successive, slight modifications"". Hence the molecular machines inside living beings are evidence of an intelligent designer-God.Intelligent design asks interesting questions about evolution, but since all its answers are usually ""God"", scientists have rejected it.As the National Academy of Sciences has said, intelligent design ""and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life"" are not science because their claims cannot be tested by experiment and propose no new hypotheses of their own.This book is definitely not science nor an explanation of what evolution is. It is a (not particularly interesting nor well written) fiction novel."
"Positive","What's not to like: I bought 4 of these for various items including a lawn tractor, a motorcycle and 2 items with full auto-size batteries. A month later all 4 of them are indicating that my batteries are fully charged. I look forward to no hassle of dead batteries in the Spring and overall longer battery life. Installation, or connecting of these is very simple and all hardware is included for either clamping them to the battery posts or installing a tail on the terminals that you simply plug into, so either way you're covered. For the price, this is a no-brainer, so you need to get one for the battery on every items that you store for longer than a month."
"Negative","HORRIBLE!: We would of given this a zero if we had the choice. So it got one star from us. We watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and we still can't get over this trash. I also broke the disc in half. I wanted to crawl under a rock when the sex scenes came on and we were watching it with my 13yr. old son. WARNING WARNING! DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE."
"Positive","Simple, Straight, True: I've given this gem away to a half-dozen friends/associates. It is simple by design, and judging from other reviewers comments, it is probably best to read it instead of listening to it. I haven't heard the tapes, but I polished it off in an afternoon at the bookstore. ""Who moved my cheese"" is a great way to express the attitude of entitlement so many career people personify. Wake up everbody! Things change fast these days. If you want to have a chuckle at your own reasons as to why YOU don't have to change, read this book. Great stuff for optimists, hard pill to swallow for stuffed shirts who value tradition excessively. Devour this slice of brie!"
"Positive","A Must Have CD: I just finished listening to Michael's new cd, "" A Song For You "". Simply put, this is a ""must have"" cd for all serious jazz lovers. The musical arrangements were excellent while remaining true to the original recordings. You will play this cd time and time again. It is just that good. Happy Listening."
"Negative","Not Happy!!: I bought these light they are ok but I did not get what I paid for...They did refund me a few dollars but that was not the point....And they are way to expensive forwhat they are...Would not buy again to pricey......was not Happy at all...Would not buy again...."
"Positive","They Major: On this onje come on now stop it, this is one of the nastiest jazz-rap or hip hop cds I've ever heard, I mean have ya'll listened to this every song is gold, this record I spin just about everyday it's that nice, it's way nicer then 85% of the stuff that comes out these days."
"Positive","Superband!: The Sign consists of Terry Brock (lead vocals), Mark Mangold (ex ""Touch"", keyboards), Randy Jackson (ex ""Zebra"", guitar), Billy Greer (ex ""Kansas, bass) and Bobby Rondinelli (ex Rainbow, drums). This CD offers some great melodic pop-rock with excellent musicians, great ""hooks"" and fantastic vocals! Fans of Journey, Kansas and late 70's rock will love this."
"Positive","connection: I am not a scholar by any stretch of the imagination. However, I am in the process of exploring myself..this life...the alternatives to this life and religion in order to broaden my mind. I do not believe the Gary Zukav is leading me to believe that he invented these theories on his own. I believe this book is merely giving a new, ""layman's"" angle on ancient philosophies and pretentious explanations. Some people do not learn as easily as others using ""traditional methods"" or ""standard theorums"" and they feel left out and unable to access this type of information. This book has been soothing and enlightening because I could grasp his suggestions by the words he chose and by the manner in which he presented them. Honestly,there are at least two sides to every story and it was nice to see the story from someone else's eyes for a change...someone a little more on my level."
"Negative","Potential rootkit installer with this CD: Apologies that I'm not commenting on the music, but buyer beware. This EMI CD displayed the following message when I tried to copy it to the music library on my hard disk:""To listen to the CD a number of files need to be updated on your PC.""As another commentator on another EMI CD wrote: ""From the research I was able to do on the Internet, this is a rootkit which is attempting to install. It is what Sony got in trouble for at one time.""I believe that commentator was correct. These rootkits have big security and performance implications. At least the Sony one caused serious performance slow down, and was very difficult for a non-expert to uninstall. So I do not recommend ever agreeing to ""update a number of files"". That's an innocent term for a very harmful practice.It's a sad state of affairs that I cannot listen to this on my computer even though I paid for a legitimate CD."
"Negative","Fan or Baby Cessna: The only plus this fan has is the remote. We used in our bedroom and it kept us awake at night. Thinking I was sensitive I moved it to the living room but I needed to turn up the T.V. to hear over it. Even on low it sounds like a baby Cessna. I would not recommend if someone wants a quiet fan. Do not like the fast/slow function. One speed goes fast, then slow, the fast again. Do not like this product."
"Negative","Bad news: I purchased this last year and some of the tips of the knives broke off with regular use. I contacted Kitchen aid and they never responded to my concerns. Love other products but not these."
"Positive","Cool as Hell!: I heard these guys first on an album called Scandinavian Friends: A tribute to Roky Erickson. They blew me away and I feel that they captured the spirit of Roky and the 13th Floor Elevators as well as any one ever will except of course the original. This cd is excellent. Kind of garage, but with modern production as well. I also bought their album titled The Mainliners and it too is fantastic. Please give these guys a try."
"Positive","Changed Life: This book was life-changing for me. It helped me realize that God is in control and is still working miracles today. Many times our faith is too small to follow where He leads us. When we follow Him - even when it makes no sense to us - He will show us his mighty power and do amazing things through those who are willing to follow."
"Positive","SOOTHING: Lute music, for me, has always brought to my life some needed peace and it has always soothed my spirits no matter what was going on in my life at the time. This recording of Sylvius Weiss's Lute sonatas #15 and #48 played by Roberto Barto is no exception. Weiss was a contemporary of J.S. Bach. He, of course, is not nearly as well known as J.S.; however, he was obviously a great composer for the lute. The two sonatas in Volume Seven are splendid and beautiful works making full use of the lute's range. I particularly enjoyed #48 in F sharp Minor (a rather unusual key for the time this work was composed in) Roberto Barto certainly plays these works splendidly with deep feeling and with wonderful technique--giving a much needed repose to my soul indeed.If you desire to hear some wonderful lute music that will offer some soothing sounds to your life that are played extremely well, buy this disc. The sound is great and by this being on the Naxos lable, it's at a great price-- a true bargain!"
"Positive","Just responding to the critical comments.: I wish Latter Day Saints would take their own advice. You are encouraging many others to study before they criticize you. You need to study your own religion first. According to the Smithsonian, there is NO archeological evidence for Mormonism, as a matter of fact many of the precious metals mentioned in the book of Mormon should not have been there until the 1400s. According to your own scriptures, there are over 3,000 changes. According to your own prophets, there was racism in the church that stated that ""Negroes"" were not blessed like the white man. According to your own Prophets, there are false prophesies never happened. According to modern Egyptology, the book of Abraham is one of the many lies that Joseph smith fooled you to believe. And according to my own studies, Joseph Smith is one of the biggest liars in history. I've never read this book but I'm planning on buying it. LDS need to take your own advice and study your scriptures and history"
"Negative","""Matrix"" wannabe: This movie tanked in the theaters and with good reason-the story and special effects are lame."
"Negative","no pictures: I was inspired to look for a cookbook after traveling through these regions -- amazing cuisine. But will never know if the recipes in this book are as delicious as what I ate while visiting. I found the lack of pictures to be too daunting to try when one isn't that familiar with the dishes and what they should look like when completed. I returned it, and my hunt continues."
"Positive","five stars: Tne best one, love the design, I just love everything in it! nice with bussiness look and casual too. it is just perfect!"
"Negative","Deff not the NEXT 10: It should not be labeled the Next 10, more like the FIRST Prehistoric 10. Did our presidents take these tests??? There are question types in here that are no longer apart of the LSAT, to study this I would have to go back and research how to answer old questions in preparation for a new test...this book should be free."
"Negative","Bad physical handset design: When you tuck this phone in between your shoulder and head (to talk without hands) the big button that ends your call presses against your face and hangs up the phone!This is just bad design. It doesn't matter if the reception is good or bad (mine is just OK) if the phone hangs up while you're talking."
"Positive","essential recording: I put this Turandot among the very best of this century. Yes, Joan Sutherland is excellent as the ice cold principessa Turandot. And Pavorotti is extraordinary as well. But I'm a little hesitant about Caballe, who sings well, but is a little bit cold in the voice. I think that Birgit Nilsson is also excellent as Turandot, but I don't think she's any better a dramatic soprano. Pavorotti will invoke memory of past dramatic tenors like Mario Del Monaco and Corelli. This is a wonderful set, and I enjoy it very much. Thank you."
"Negative","Close but no cigar!: This is an o.k. version of the soundtrack but If you want the complete recording then you have to get the two C.D. version of this musical. This soundtrack cuts off alot of music from the songs alot of the instumentals are omitted from this recording...Shop carefully!"
"Positive","Sometimes it is the Little Things Things That Give You the Greatest Joy!: When I first put up my new shower curtain using these roller shower curtain rings, I acted like a little kid fascinated by a magic trick. I stood in front of the tub, moving the shower curtain back and forth, reveling in the sound of the rollers on the shower rod and the smooth glide and effortless movement of the shower curtain.These are the best thing since sliced bread.I recommend the ""heavy duty"" RollerRings like these. The larger size does make a difference."
"Negative","Yawn . . .: As is the case with Scrawl, which this band reminds me of, I can't understand why anyone would want to listen to this murky snoozefest. Guitars chug along with nary a melody or catchy riff, vocals are flat, and the mix is all wrong. Generally unimaginative guitar rock that I am loathe to label ""indie."" Are the lyrics good? Who knows -- I didn't listen long enough to find out. Why not listen to something interesting instead?"
"Positive","Eye opener: Amazing life changing book that will guide and teach you how to turn around the way you have been living and get rid of some bad habits along the way. if you need to change this book will rock your world. excellent book. teaches you the importance of having the strength to say yes and no and take control of your life."
"Negative","Operation Earth: Brinsley Le Poer Trench seems to have produced a work that is rather good. Usually his theories are to fantastical even for someone as myself that believes in the Ancient Astronaut theory. Usually he proposes a hollow earth theory in his works, but here he is more down to earth. His central theme for this book is that our creators (spacemen) have been in contact with our race for aeons, that they initiated the genesis of civilisation and that actually we were once their slaves. There is a rather unnecessary chapter at the beginning that is a story written to illustrate his view on alien influence on us. This would put you of, but reading further he actually makes a good case for his theory, particularly when describing that the human race is just an experiment, and that we are Infact on a kind of cosmic probation. Interesting point when you consider the similarity to the biblical last judgement story."
"Positive","Great interactive book...but easily destroyed by 2 yr. old!: My daughter loved this book! The movable parts even made her demand her potty so that she could try the same movements as the book's character! In the first hour, though, she tore one of the tabs. Still, a fun and engaging book!"
"Negative","WARNING, SINATRA'S NOT LAST RECORDING!: This was recorded mid 1980's, except for 1994/3 pavaroti song, this is not sinatra's last live album, certainly not his 1995 birthday concert album, last time he had one, songs ok but nothing special, out of prime!"
"Negative","The worst Robin Cook novel ever: One of the worst novels I've read (and definitely the worst Robin Cook novel). A good premise, but it reads like Mr. Cook phoned this one in (or had a ghost writer?).Skip this one."
"Negative","Never too Late to get started....: I have read almost all of Robyn's books and for some reason, this one dragged on a bit. Although, I loved the characters and commend Robyn for always expressing the importance of safe-sex! I am waiting patiently for the next Virgin River Book to come out and can sincerely say that it is the characters of that series that are the best/colorful. While this book did somewhat succeed at holding me over a little bit until the next Virgin River book, I found that I couldn't wait to get it over with but was unable to devour it as I do her other books."
"Negative","Excuse me, but no: Okay, what is it about this book does everyone love?? I don't understand. It's boring, there's no action, and the kid beats people up (not that I mind that). It has GOT to be one of the most boring books I've ever read, and the few actions scenes are not that well written."
"Positive","One of the best movies of all time! Very hard to find, glad I was able to find it!: I have been looking for this movie everywhere and I finally found it! Thanks QUICK N EASY! The fact that it was collector's edition with special features made it even better!"
"Positive","for the toddler at heart: I just downloaded these one day as they were so inexpensive for my 18-month old twins who were driving me crazy one breakfast... Much to my chagrin, they loved them SO much more than their many expensive, stylish, ""adult friendly"" CD's. There are many songs with animal sounds that they can make (""old Mcdonald"") or hand signs (the wheels on the bus is a big fav). And after a while, you will find yourself humming them too (I've sadly found myself humming fuzzy wuzzy at work...)These are simple, easy-to=sing, fun songs and they are what your toddlers want to hear. And there are 30 of them. What more could you want?"
"Positive","POWER RANGERS: This was the first power rangers ep ever. If you are buying this copy for the first box art then do it. But if you are looking to buy this because you just wanted to see the ep then you should look for the CLASSIC RED RANGER tape. You get two ep for less. You get this ep Day of the Dumpster and The Wannabe Ranger."
"Negative","Fool me once...: I will not consider purchasing any blu-ray LOTR movie unless it includes theatrical/extended/director's cut/let's rip them off again cut. To be clear my rating only applies to the practice of ripping off customers with multiple, steadily improving cuts of movies. The actual movies themselves are of course 5 star masterpieces."
"Negative","Not bad. Not good.: While it is soothing because of its' texture, peanut oil, olive oil or any other oil would have had the same effect in my opinion. Sorry."
"Negative","HORRIBLE: I can't believe I read the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, that something would happen...nothing did. First of all, college kids don't act this way; as if they were 45 or 50 years old. Let's just say, there was way too much latent stuff going on between the friends and rivals and mentors...It just seems as if the authors promoted a lot of touching and male nakedness going on. Weird. If you got rid of all the useless drivel about Princeton, the book would be 10 pages long. It appears as if the authors wanted a memoir of their time at Princeton, not to actually write a story; let alone make it somewhat interesting. The characters were uninteresting and boring. The plot was way too unbelievable. The characters were able to walk around crime scenes and escape from police as if they were invisible. The authors were far out of their league. I wish I could have the time back that I spent reading this wreck."
"Negative","hated it.: I do not know why but i justed hated this book, i could not even finish it so i could not tell you what its about."
"Negative","Shameful rip-off: The way this CD is marketed and packaged, you think you're getting a phenomenal collection of great movie songs.Far from it. All songs are covers by some sort of slick-sounding bar band.Don't buy this. Tremendous waste of money."
"Positive","feedback of Tenchu Wrath Of Heven: Hi,you can call me ALANA.YOU see,I think that Tenchu Wrath Of Heven should have more stars.I've had it once, I mean not me but my half brother Vince, little Vince.You see, he brought it over to my house.He tought me how to play,I thought it was the bomebigiddy.Then I got stuck with it!It was like A cruse!!! BUT,I still thought it was cool.Becedis,red,black,gray,and white are my favorite colors.And I love the short song and the video in the begining of the game.SO,maybe maybe you should add more stars for Tenchu.I'm I'm not tring to be mean but, it's a really good game.Well I gotta...go now so I hope you guys change your mind about Tenchu.Oh,...BY!!!"
"Negative","Jolly Old Santa Claus: I have searched high and low for this favorite childhood Christmas book that my parents read to me and my siblings. Unfortunately, the newest edition is nothing like the soft covered book my mother still holds close to her heart. The original book has such magical pictures that really do allow you to ""believe"". I remember being read to and then turning the pages to this image that still is imbedded in my mind. I hope they will come out with the first edition of this book, for the newest ""collectors edition"" is not worth collecting at all."
"Positive","I totally disagree with Kathy!!: The French version was ok but the American was a lot better. The cast in the french version was slow and well boring. The movie itself was bad the lighting, voices, actors and actresses I didnt like it at all. In the American version it is fast good lighting good actors and actresses and downright funny, and for us americans a lot easier to watch! So I give it 5 stars all the way!!"
"Negative","Software crashes with AMD 64 X2 CPU: Go check out Logitech's own forums. The software for this camera crashes Windows if you have a new AMD dualcore CPU. I have contacted Logitech about this and they offer no fix nor pretend to have one in the works. Don't get this camera if you have a CPU like mine."
"Positive","It Slices! It Dices! And A Whole Lot More!: After making due with a blender for years, we finally decided to upgrade to a real honest to goodness food processor. My only regret is not doing it sooner. My pesto is smoother, my breadcrumbs are more uniform, and things just somehow magically taste better when using it.The only drawback is that it's quite large and heavy, meaning you need some counter space."
"Positive","Two & a Half Men - Second Season: I truly enjoyed this purchase. Charlie Sheenis very funny. Jon Cryer is also very funny."
"Negative","This stuff is Dangerous: This product is so dry it can cut a Cat's mouth, cause bleeding and choking. The product I received from Petco was dry as a Bone. It could be compared to eating a Fish without debonning it first. You wouldn't feed your Family Fish Bones. My cats are my Family.Maybe te product I received was no the usual quality, but it was dry, dry dry. Both the Salmon and Whiting were equally dry."
"Negative","faulty product: SanDisk flash drives have a really short life compared to lexmark, A-Data, and other USB flash drives. It worked fine for a short while and died. I have older smaller memory flash drives made by other companies that I purchased well before my SanDisk ones and they are all still working. I've found I'm most happy with A-Data's Jogr due to the price and lifetime warranty(all USB devices will eventually ware out the connection but SanDisk wares out unreasonably fast). Not all USB flash drives by the same company are the same, I do have one flimsy plastic cased 128MB one from SanDisk that is still working fine."
"Positive","sounds great: Purchased this CD for one of my children as a gift. The quality of the music from the Broadway production is great."
"Positive","Great Toy: My 4 year old figured out how to use all of the features in about 30 minutes. She chases us around the house constantly taking pictures and making movies. She loves, loves, loves it. The special effects are hilarious, the movies have sound and the games are fun. It just fell from the top of the fridge and still works just great. We haven't tried to print pictures yet but she doesn't care nor do I. So don't worry about the photo quality - it is a toy afterall. The kids just want to take pictures and they don't know the photos aren't LIFE magazine quality. Would buy again in a heart beat."
"Negative","very unhappy with the guns in this book: Sorry to be PC, but I don't expect a children's book aimed at 3 year olds to show kids playing with toy guns. My son was (unfortunately) fascinated by the guns since he'd never seen them. TWO of the scenes in this book show playing with toy guns. I wish I'd thrown this book out when it was given to us as a gift."
"Negative","Good plot, however, disappointing ending.: The concept of the book is terrific, however, I found the writing to be too amateurish and at times a bit too slow---even though the book is only 223 pages! The ending disappointed me because I felt it was a bit of a cop-out. I'm sorry to say, but I would not recommend this book to anyone else."
"Negative","Motorcycle carrier: What a great idea to be able to use a 2 inch hitch to carry a motorcycle or scooter. I assembled the product and it looks like it was going to work really well to transport my scooter. However.........the problem I had with this product was that there was no way to attach the scooter to the hitch. The hitch needed two tall bars on the inside about the height of the tailgate to attach the scooter and keep it from falling into the tailgate. Without these bars or something in between the hitch and truck..........my scooter fell inward and got all scratched up. Using straps from the truck to the scooter held the scooter in place but again scratched up the paint in 3 places as it still was only balanced on the track and something needed to be in between the tailgate and the bike. I returned the product as any bump in the road caused the scooter fall back and forth into the tailgate and scratch the paint."
"Positive","Good Show, Bad Packaging: I love the Outer Limits show, along with Twilight Zone, One Step Beyond and all of the old scifi shows! Having these shows to watch whenever I feel like it is wonderful! My complaint is with the packaging. The discs are 2 sided and aren't labeled so you'll have to squint to see the tiny writing on the inner part of the disc to figure out which disc you have in hand and if it's side A or B. This might sound easy but trust me, this writing is tiny! And whatever you do, don't mix up your discs!! You'll go into the outer limits trying to figure them out!You know how you're sitting around and you think of a particluar show and want to watch it? You can do just that with this movie set, but it won't be easy finding which disc and which side.All in all, I'm thrilled to have these episodes to watch at will, I'm just not happy at all with the way the discs were made or how they're presented.If you're a fan like me, it's worth it ... but plan to grit your teeth here and there!"
"Positive","Best Pots Ever: When I purchased these pots, I thought ""Non-stick for husband learning how to cook!"" Now I am so happy I bought them because the are no fuss and easy to work with; they heat evenly and they keep food hot long after fire is off (If you keep the lid on).The only down side is the condensation from the tops can get into your dish if you don't remove them carefully.I have already baked with them and used them for cooking a meal for 10 and I have had no problems with burning or handling. They are not small and the lids fit all pots well. The handles help with high heat as do the top holder removers.I would recommend this product to frequent cookers and beginners"
"Positive","""The lost art of listing."": .....this book wAs and is a good book for me Ithought I listen rather well I come to find out I like to talk, may be because I don't get listen to. That makes a big difference when someone takes the time to listen to you. And you know you were listen to. Good book I'm rereading it again. thank youDonna Shrader"
"Positive","A good read!: I read the Khumba Document a few years ago, and I have been hoping to see a sequel to this facinating novel. The women protagonists of two different eras are keenly developed as believable characters. The plot transcends time, which makes the reader ponder how events of the past influence the present.If you enjoyed Dan Brown's DaVinci Code, you will enjoy the Khumbu Document."
"Positive","Sharp R-315JS: I too spent a lot of time researching microwaves before I decided on this one. It was very discouraging to read all the negative reviews. Particularly the ones regarding the quality and stability of the parts. I too owned a Sharp for 18 years with no repairs. My hope is this one will last half as long. It is certainly more attractive and modern compared to the old one. The controls on the inside of the door do take a bit of getting use to and the secrets to getting the setting right will take some practice, but it will be worth it to have the good looks of this product.Delivery was fast and free. I could have paid a bit less on another website but I wanted the confidence and backing of Amazon should anything go wrong. Set up was easy, no stickers on the door to scrape off. Cooking so far has been normal and spot-on with temps and time. My recommendation, GET IT."
"Positive","VERY GOOD but lacked a little: I just bought this book and it was so interesting I read it all in one day, excelent grafics, everything was easy to understand and laid out just right so anyone could understand it. The only problem I found was that it didn't go as deep as I wanted to but still deep enough to keep you busy for a few months putting into practice what you learn in the book."
"Positive","The Perfect Book: This version gives the reader a in depth study into Gods word (with very informational sidebars)"
"Positive","The BEST researched historical novel that I've read: Mr Lund has done an almost superhuman job of doing the research necessary to make this novel believable. I was most impressed with the details of the town of Palmyra and vicinity as well as the historical context of the Erie Canal. I hadn't realized that the Erie Canal went through the area (I live in Washington State and have never been to the Palmyra area). Lund's descriptions were so clear that I could easily picture the setting of each Chapter. The book also has historically accurate tidbits of information about LDS Church history, which added interest to the story.Reading this book has given me an interest in taking a vacation to visit historic LDS Church landmarks in the eastern USA.--George Stancliffe"
"Negative","iPod speaker with docking station by CTA: I purchased 2 of these sound stage docking stations, which are marketed specifically for use with the iPod. Neither one worked properly. The iPods did not play through the station's speakers when docked - they had to be connected to the station with a cable for the music to play. Also, this docking station would not charge the iPods (one of the primary product features). A message displayed on the iPod screens stating that the devices were not compatible. This product was a total waste of money."
"Negative","Replacement cartridge costs an arm and a leg and leaks powder badly...: My power bill went up quite a lot by using this printer. When I tried to print return address labels with it, it won't. Replacement cartridge costs an arm and a leg (costs more than the printer) and leaks powder badly. Cheapest replacement cartridge for this con machine costs over a $100!!! ""SAMSUNG"" will not replace the badly powder-leaking cartridge nor refund the money! Office Depot will not either!Otherwise a very fast printer while new. Not sure how long it stays that way. Although it stinks when it prints and is probably unhealthy to use, cause one must stay as far away from it as possible to avoid the dangerous fumes and strong burning powder smell it emits.I would avoid this printer at all costs and not buy anything made by ""SAMSUNG"" (Korea).Also - do not make a mistake by purchasing a ""BROTHER"" printer, cause those things are even worse and are made to fail while new!"
"Positive","Well Written ~ Funny: This movie is a classic, have seen it many times. The ""Dude"" is truly Zen and the characters and stories def do not follow any traditional Hollywood protocol. A better part could not have been made for Jeff Bridges."
"Positive","YUP YUP: Robert (William Bumler) is traumatized in his boyhood after witnessing his father's death. He lives in the streets with a nervous twitch and is known as the ""Yup Yup Man"" because he always says, ""Yup Yup."" Alarmed over all the crime that goes on in the city, and inspired by the comic book, ""Dark Justice"" Robert wants to fight back as a super hero known simply as ""cape crusader."" His bartender friend Jack helps him construct an outfit. After Robert kills seven people and shaves his beard, he loses his twitch. Blood, sexual situations, no nudity. Bumler did an excellent job as the bearded neurotic Yup Yup man."
"Negative","Good Beginner Book: This book is good for the beginner that feels unsure in their explaination of the Tarot. Tarot Made Easy takes the reader in a simplified way through all the possible ways of interpretation of the Tarot. This book focuses more on the art of fortune telling than the exploration of the personal soul journey that can be the Tarot."
"Positive","A solid pick holder: This works. It's basically a pick pocket with a spring to keep them in place. It works great, i'm glad I found it.The sticky stuff on the back keeps it where you want it (on my guitar), and it comes off without leaving a mess."
"Positive","Heartbreaking and Lovely: This is such a wonderful book on so many levels. This book contains a beautiful love story, complicated family dynamics and fascinating depictions of WWII. The main character, Tatiana is seventeen living in Leningrad Russia with her family just as Germany begins to invade in the east. Tatiana is living in a communal housing building and sharing a two room apartment with six family members. As the war begins in their country the family is scrambling to figure out what to do. Meanwhile Tatiana meets Alexander, a soldier in the Red Army. They quickly discover that they have an unbreakable connection however they also soon discover something that may (and should?) keep them apart forever.This is such a wonderful story. Those who love romance, love, and historical fiction will LOVE this book."
"Negative","Rowenta DG5030 = JUNK: Purchased this steam generator new 5/15/2010. Last week (six months later) the pressure tank leaked water from the seam in rear of tank. Pressure tank rupture = dangerous. Emailed corporate. Reply was ship to repair center via traceable insured carrier (UPS?FEDEX).....cost to be $ 40+. We felt repairs to a ruptured pressure tank seam to be inadequate from a safety standpoint and requested a replacement. Reply was that warranty only covered repairs and we should return to the retailer for replacement. Inasmuch as the retailer (Bed Bath & Beyond) didn't manufacture this POS I can't in good conscience do that. This model is made in..............China, not Germany. Loousy product. Worse customer service."
"Negative","I won't ever buy something like this again: I haven't even used this once, since I put it on my fingers, I knew this would scratch the screen as a knive to the butter. It seemed to be useful, but I don't like it."
"Positive","FUNNY!: Wow! when you put chris rock and Ice Cube in one movie you now this is going to be funny! This is one of the funniest movies you will ever see. A great start to a great sequeal. Watch this movie and every friday in the sequeal. Highly Recommended"
"Negative","Too Sentimental: Tears of the Sun just isn't my type of movie, but it's not all bad either. I'd rank it slightly above Black Hawk Down. Honestly, I was hoping for more action. This movie is rather slow paced with lots of ""emotion"" tossed in. It takes an otherwise entertaining action flick downhill, in my opinion.Things aren't all bad though. There's some great action mixed in between all the sappy parts, and nearly all the the actors playing the US soldiers give a great performance. The ironic thing is, most of the characters seem just as annoyed at the slow pace and sappy nature of it all as I did, which made it that much more tolerable.- Rirath_com"
"Negative","Huge Disappointment: I totally agree with all the reviews who give this item three stars or less. The first cd I bought from Jimmy Thackery was ""Trouble Man"". If this had been the first, I probably would have taken him off my list of artist to purchase. Everything else I've heard or purchased by him is far better!"
"Negative","In play full comforter: Compared to the pillowcases I received, the comforter looked faded, like it was used. Was disappointed in the appearance!"
"Negative","what is all the fuss about?: People seem to love this book - I do not know why. I bought Watermelon at a regular bookstore, so I have no excuse not to have perused the contents prior to making the purchase. I tried valiantly to finish this book - but few things have struck me as such a waste of time. I had removed the price tag when I began reading, by soon found myself finding the discarded piece of sticker, unfolding it and sticking it back on the book in an attempt to return it to where I purchased it. Alas, I neglected to do that in a timely manner, and now am just an embarrassed owner of this book...I will never finish it - but will always be reminded of the foolishness of buying a book based on the concept and raves of everyone around me - or maybe it was just the clever product placement. To be fair to the author I think it would make a better stand-up comedy routine than a novel."
"Negative","Defective product right out of the box: When I fired it up I tested it on several dvd and they played ok. But when I went and tried to play some of my divx dvds, about 1/3 of them worked. The other 2/3's the video would just go nuts. It would only show a black and white picture and the vertical-hold would go crazy. I stopped the discs and tried to go in the main menu and the picture would not clear up. To get it to stop I had to put a regular dvd in it to stabilize. The discs that would play, I tried to select different play tracks but it would only continue to play the first one."
"Positive","Great Rockin' Blues: Great CD of old vinyl copy I had.. Great songs and well worth the listen ..A rocker and blues man who passed long before his time.. This was my first tasteof Rory's music. I have liked all his music an would suggest listening to them all."
"Negative","Big Problems with Amazon's Quality Control: The DVD did not match the title of the cover. Literally the wrong movie was in the ""Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story"" sleeve. Pretty much of a let down. Come on Amazon get on your suppliers.Joe"
"Negative","Perhaps the most useless gift I recieved: This is probably the most useless baby item I have ever recieved. It takes a quite a bit of room in my cabinets and I have never once used it. I don't know- It seems that hot soapy water works just fine to wash my baby's bottles. Don't waste your money or your cabinet space. There are at least 1000 other items I would recommend before this one."
"Positive","Folk + Personal Protest = American Tradition Updated: Lyrically this is the best work this Texas trio has produced. The tracks are confessional, personal and universal. That's a tough act to pull off without dipping into dreckiness. The Chicks don't disappoint. However ... and please don't flame me on this ... I strongly prefer their earlier CDs musically and instrumentally. Why? I miss the bluegrass and acoustic elements. While they're here as salt and pepper in the mix, Rick Rubin's production leans every track into 70s-era FM-ready country-rock in the Eagles/Asylum Records/Jackson Browne/et al mold. Yes ... the 70s Asylum catalog is a priceless section of my music collection. But that doesn't mean I want THAT sound with TODAY'S Dixie Chicks CDs. So ... four stars, not five. (Though I'd probably tilt it toward three-and-a-half if I could.)"
"Positive","A book to read over and over again: First, I must admit that I am 26 years old and I still read Tamora Pierce's books. I started with Alanna 14 years ago. I enjoy reading about Alanna's world and her adventures. The mixture of knighthood and magic is wonderful. I also enjoy watching Alanna grow first as a young page, then squire, and finally as a knight. The transitions and relationships she faces are timeless. This is a great book to a excellent series."
"Negative","not durable: I didn't use this ball very much (twice a week at top), but it developed a leak in 5 months. Very disappointed. Not durable."
"Negative","not worth it: Too expensive, no rap, missing too much to be worth [amt]. There are many other better compilations, especially those from Rhino."
"Positive","Excellent: Smart. Exciting,seen all 5 years. Gets better as time goes on.i look forward to the next season..very different and worth watching."
"Positive","This is a very handy tool to keep in the shop!: I picked one of these up cheap at a local hardware store and I find that I use it all the time. Not only is it a good straightedge and ruler, but the center 'wall' makes it ideal as a guide to cutting with a utility knife (by protecting your fingers). Although this tool is made of aluminum, it is very heavy duty aluminum that does not bend, twist, or flex significantly. I have used mine in a pinch as a clamping aid when gluing up two or more boards into a panel. I simply use clamps to pull the panel's joints tight against this ruler, thus producing a pretty flat surface!It is inexpensive and you will find all kinds of uses for it - I highly recommend it!"
"Negative","A Vendetta: One shouldn't doubt that Jung Chang has reason to despise Mao, having lived through the effects of his reign. Mao himself certainly left plenty of evidence of his tyranny. The problem is that the vendetta is so obvious that it reaches self-parody after a couple hundred pages. The authors purport to know Mao's actual thoughts at specific times, suggest that he deserves the blame (if that's the proper word) for Stalin's death, and take an obvious relish in describing Mao's incompetence regarding such as language acquisition and management. Don't base all of your knowledge of the subject on this single source."
"Negative","Fell off the wall: After two weeks the tape did not hold and it fell off the wall. Just as well, had to press dispensor too many times for the shampoo. Taking it back and buying a different brand."
"Negative","Drains batteries fast: The review title says it all. Once the batteries start wearing out (after about 30 min) you can barely feel a breeze."
"Negative","doesn't ring: the phone wwas cheap priced and i read the reviews and bought it but mine doesnt ring so now i have to get another one. not happy"
"Positive","Excellent - reliable and simple to use - best on the market: I have owed several different portable players and in my view the iPod is simply the best, certainly the most reliable and simple to use. It also best selection of downloads and accessories."
"Positive","Another chapter in the legend: How do you find new words to describe the talent that is Bruce Springsteen? First let me say that this work ranks among his very best, despite a tendancy to assume greatness cannot follow so long after someone's assumed ""prime"". I find that during these later stages of his career, Bruce has just as much to say while his musical abilities have improved. These songs are just fantastic, well-crafted, joyous, touching, haunting, fun. The band is amazing, better like fine wine. This is the first CD I've purchased in a long time where I've played it through over and over for 3 weeks without removing it from my player. Just a great event in the career of the most important figure in pop/rock music since 1970."
"Positive","Lovely Writing, An Interesting Look at a Pivotal Time for Women: I'd previously enjoyed Sarah Orne Jewett's The Country of the Pointed Firs. Stumbling across this book, I decided to give it a go. Loved the feeling of being immersed in a time in history when women had to make the choice between a career and marriage and family. The book also paints an interesting portrait of rural life and its contrasts with the lure of city/society. The mystery of the main character's family background with its hints of her dead parents' personalities and their potential impact on our heroine is skillfully woven into the story. A really good read."
"Positive","The Best...: The Ozark Mountain Daredevils will probably always be my very favorite American band. I believe they would have been my fave regardless, but they have a special sentimental cache for me--I came from the same town they are from (Springfield, MO) and in the 1970's, we got to hear them often. The secret of the Daredevil's music was that it made you feel really good. I can't think of a single unit of musicians who so consistently produced music that can make you feel better. The music on this album, and many of the records that followed just seem to clear your head of all bad thoughts. The Daredevils are first-rate singers, musicians, and songwriters. They're just the best. Always have been, always will be...this is what American music was supposed to be about. Thanks, guys..."
"Negative","Evidence of society's decline: I don't get this stuff. Number one, it sure isn't music, not by a long shot. Second, it serves no positive purpose in society, and serves to add to the (seemingly growing) pot of negative influences.Taken at face value, the lyrics are horrendous, shameful, unthinkable. Looking deeper than face value, there may be some humor at play here, but if that is the case, then it is very, very sick humor. Like someone telling dirty jokes at a funeral.This is something that would never have made record store shelves back in more sane, honorable days."
"Negative","Appalling: This is a personal opinion, but appalled is the only word I can use to describe this. And it's not really that musically interesting to me. The singing is excellent, but the story and the music.. that's another thing. Again, I know many people like it, but this is just not my cup of tea."
"Positive","Epic: This was a great episode. It moved pretty rapidly, and there was a lot going on. Team Shane is small, but formidable at this point."
"Positive","Good Textbook: This is a good Polymer Chemistry Textbook. It is very informative. However, it isn't the most exciting read. The book is completely black and white, making it hard to read for extended periods of time. I would recommend this textbook for the quality of it's information."
"Negative","bw/wm mystery: This was an excellent mystery and fine love story. Very interesting and very worth the cost and time."
"Positive","the hook......: before i knew who no doubt was i was a mess. but one day i picked up return of saturn and i was hooked. no doubt changed my life for the best is to many ways to count. if you dont have even one of the five no doubt albums get one and i promise you. you wont be disapointed."
"Positive","So Far so Good: I have only had this for about a month, but for my uses, it works just fine. For the most part, I use it for stairs, but have used it for minor spills. Charge has held, and ease of use is what I expected."
"Positive","Monster House (Fullscreen): Little DJ has suspicions about the house across the street and the cranky old man who lives there. When the old man has a heart attack and is carried away by an ambulance, DJ thinks the danger is over. Unfortunately, as he, his friend Chowder, and a candy-selling prep-school girl named Jenny discover, the house itself has plans, plans that include eating all the kids who'll be trick-or-treating that Halloween night. The best part of the movie definitely has to be the characters. Each were extremely well thought out and put together. They did a fantastic job of matching right voices with the right characters. Characters facial expressions were amazing. You'll find yourself laughing at things they say and do quite a lot. If you are looking for a fun, clean movie with plenty of laughs, this is definitely one you don't want to miss."
"Positive","The Book of Awakening: very well written book. am enjoy reading it right now.i find it a very good self help book with many helpful suggestions throughout."
"Negative","Not what I was expecting...: Maybe I should have been move savy to check the song before I bought this CD,... But this CD does Not have the Popular version of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"". I was really disappointed when I first played the CD. Bummer! Oh Well, Live and Learn."
"Positive","A step up from their first: An overall improvement from the first GLS long player. Gotta say I like it more than something like Iron & Wine. To take nothing away from Iron & Wine, the GLS sound is just a bit more consistent and pleasing to the ear. Why should you buy it? Because after a long day at work, this is excellent dinner-cooking and dinner-eating music for people who don't want to listen to Miles Davis. Also, the babes will think you're cool."
"Positive","Jamie is learning how to be ""Brave"": Jamie O'Neal hit the country scene in 2000 with the award-winning album ""Shive"" which included the hit single ""When I Think About Angels,"" and now, 5 years later, Jamie has proved that she still has the voice and the attitude that it takes to make it big, on the new follow-up album ""Brave.""The album starts out with ""Trying To Find Atlantis,"" which is the first hit single and moves onto ""Naive,"" which is about love and just running away from true love then followed by ""Somebody's Hero."" More of the stand out tracks are ""Devil On The Left"" and ""On My Way To You."" With the new album ""Brave"" I can listen to the full album without skipping one track!! I can't wait for the next album from Jamie O'Neal. This girl has proof that you can leave and come back again with style!!"
"Positive","My Favorite Book on Rudel!: Printed by Schiffer Publishing, an assurance that it is top quality. There are other books that deal more in Rudel's life, both the good and the questionable post-war, but this one pretty much has everything that all but the most ardent reader would. Enough text to please, and many, many splendid photographs. Most people don't realize that the greatest Lufwaffe pilot didn't fly fighters, but the Ju-87, and man, did he ever fly it! He had no equal. Whatever his post-war activities, I'm not here to judge, but this is a splendid book of perhaps the most accomplished pilot of WWII."
"Positive","Addictively fun.: I bought this so my daughters would have fun playing it in the future. I got addicted the game and played it all the way through in no time. when my oldest daughter is just a lil older, it will be fun to get to play along side her. The bonus level you have to work towards is a jip though. otherwise have fun."
"Positive","Allergy sufferers: After two years of frustration, trying to figure out why my skin broke out in small rashes, I stopped using OTC liquid soaps and started using Free & Clear liquid soap and shampoo. In two days I was rash free and remain after months of use. If you suffer from skin rashes, give this a try. It worked like a miracle for me."
"Negative","NOT ENOUGH INFO ON THE GODDESS: This was a boring video. It was more like someone reading a story to me. I thought that it would more information and more like a movie.It wasn't as good as most documentaries.I would not spend my money again with this author."
"Negative","There is no warranty: I received a Panasonic 2.4GHz phone as a gift. I was satisfied with the performance of the phone until the mouthpiece stopped working after 8-9 months. When I called the factory for warranty and repair information I was stonewalled. I had to wait at least six minutes everytime I called (seven times). I was promised warranty coverage ( a warranty verification letter) on two occasions but it never arrived and no one ever contacted me. On my seventh call I was informed that the phone was now out of warranty by two months and that even though I had been trying to get coverage for four months that they would not cover it. Do yourself a favor and don't buy a Panasonic phone. I'm sure that any other manufacturer would stand behind their products better than Panasonic"
"Positive","Christ-Centered Education: To pursue higher education that is Christ-based ... what can be better than that? If you're at a crossroad, trying to decide which way to go for your academic pursuits, hear what Chuck Smith and Brian Nixon have to say on the topic. Both of them love the Lord and are very smart!"
"Positive","Show you wished Never Ended: THE best series I have viewed. From episode 1 I was hooked, and I couldnt wait every week for it to air,"
"Positive","Two thumbs up!: This is my first bread machine but it was so easy to use.My first loaf of bread came out so great.Since it has timer, I could get it done by early morning and the first loaf made everyone happy.So happy to have this machine and I will recommend this to my friends."
"Negative","A philosophy professor's lecture and lunch conversation: A rambling, self-important, name-dropping, and pretentious work that I forced myself to finish. The literary device of focusing on discussions with two fictional students during much of the book was annoying and an easy way to increase page count without requiring serious rigor. I have just started Galbraith's 'Money'; it seems much more robust, though admittedly of a slightly different focus."
"Negative","Gasket for 4 qt. Mirro pressure cooker: Gasket wouldn't seal at all. Waste of time effort and money! Will not be ordering again.Gasket was way too narrow."
"Positive","Fun, humours and pleasant to the eyes: There's one fine line between well-played and over-played layouts. The full Geronimo Stilton series falls into the well-played category: the outcome is pleasant and not too loud and the fonts / colour used are really a statement on their own.Another point to note is the translation involved. While this is not ""literature"" literature, the adaptation in cultural and linguistics aspect are well taken care of.I don't know any Italian but have compared the Chinese and English versions of the same book (yes, my colleague at work has the entire Chinese series while I'm catching up by matching the English version). The funny bits are transformed elegantly.Recommended to not only children, but anyone who's intersted in translating humour and layout."
"Positive","Missed it!: Man this brings back memories, glad it's here. I'm not an audio perfectionist by any means but to me it sounds great and reminds me of the times when I owned the vinyl. I forgot just how good it was!"
"Positive","Good stuff!: Considerable savings vs. the stuff in stores, and it works very well. A pleasure to find a relatively inexpensive product that works well."
"Positive","Great for beginning!: I found this book very useful just like any other Wrox book. It has everything one needs to start learning .Net database applications. I have not tried the code but the explanations are helpful. The thing I like the most was list of sequential steps needed to perform a task before any example. It really breaks down the whole exercise into some meaningful steps and helps one follow the example clearly."
"Positive","wonderfull colletor toy: This toy is so cute and the collectability will go up in time it was not easy to find. But when I got mine I purchased a second one for a friend who just had a baby girl a few days before.I told them that little girls need there heros to and that it would be wonderfull for her later on in life to have something to start a collection for her."
"Positive","Best one ever!: My husband said this is the best one he has ever bought! He bought another one but a different strength."
"Positive","set yourself onto this album.: 'Set Yourself on Fire' is a great new release from Stars. With poignant lyrics, and a myriad of melodies interlacing on each track, this album is a delight for the ears. Some of the most heart-felt songwriting I've heard in a long time dominates each song; an important feature in great music that has gone so far overlooked in recent years. Of note, the opener, 'Your Ex-Lover is Dead' begins this album on such a breathtaking note, that it is hard not to keep listening. Stars bring to 'Set Yourself on Fire' a unique sound that showcases the talent of this group, while paying homage to the je ne sais quoi that is Montreal. Together with the Arcade Fire, Stars are producing some of the best Canadian music at the moment. This is a great album, and should not be missed. A best pick for this year, for sure. But this album!"
"Negative","This book - 96% bad!: You will like this book if you like reading about :How the West is so stupid and rigid in its definitions.How Bart Kosko is enlightened with earth-shattering epiphanies while meditating in lotus position.The same things repeated over and over and over again with no apparent direction.The new panacea that will enable us to live in the world of George Jetson.You will not like reading this book if you like reading about :Which problems are best solved by the use of fuzzy engineering, why, and how to develop solutions, elucidated in a concise manner."
"Negative","Cool Lights, Everything Else, Not So Cool: The plastic housing looked cool in the picture. In real life, it looks cheap.The documentation that came with the unit was poor at best.There was no hard drive jumper configuration information at all. I had to research that issue on the internet for myself.On a positive note, assembly was a breeze. That is the only positive I statement that I can make about this ULTRA unit.Lastly, the cooling fan became very noisy after only a couple of days of use.I don't normally write reviews, but if I can save any of you out there from wasting your money, my time was well spent.My plan now is to trash this housing and go with an aluminum ""heatsink"" type housing with no fan"
"Positive","Works great: If you don not adjust this and fit it correctly, you dog can get the muzzle leash off, but the neck stays connected so that keeps them from escaping which is great for my little jack Russell mix! Keeps her from pulling and no training needed for her! Worked from the first time."
"Negative","First of all, I think the titile is very ironic!!!: I honestly think you were just making fun of Haiti and its people.."
"Negative","Hard to control: This is my first PS2 game, and only for 2 hours I found that it is hard to control, and sold it to a second hand game store..."
"Positive","Beautiful Computer: Well thought out design. The instruction book is fine, but doesn't tell you when to load the disks on setting up the computer.I'm a PC user for years, so I really enjoyed this MAC. I could have done without all the games and toys (music, etc.) The tiny video camera startled me at first."
"Negative","VERY BAD: I never received this item. They say the USPS left a note and held it at the post office, but I cannot find the package. VERY bad. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR."
"Positive","Outstanding Foundation of Customer Satisfaction: I found this latest offering by Dr. Subir Chowdhury to be an excellent review of how to satisfy customers. The books start out by using the dilemma that many organizations find themselves in today (losing market share and/or customers). Then allows the manager to find a way to be directly involved in identifying how to satisfy the organization's perspective/actual customers (actual contacts). I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve his or her performance."
"Positive","State To State by Ace Denaro: I think the song is good I have seen Ace on other shows and watch him as a performer. I look forward to the release of his video. Yes he use a few lest then choice words but so doze a lot of other artist.Over all the music is good and I will buy it and so will many of my friends look forward to more of his work."
"Positive","Adirondack Home: Gorgeous book! Am a fan of Mr. Kylloe's books as I love log homes. This book makes a wonderful gift for anyone interested in the prospect of owning or living in a log structure. You cannot go wrong with Mr. Kylloe's books. The photography is stunning and the pages contain very unusual log and rustic artifacts."
"Positive","Says it all: I just want to echo bilge's comments. I, too, picked this book up in a overstock bin and found it compelling and fascinating. If you can get a hold of a copy, buy it!"
"Positive","A SUPER BOOK!!!: This was one of the best books in the series. I think Ashleigh made the rifgt choice to give her to Hopewell. It was very thoughtful and nice of her to give Lightning to them. I think it's wonderful that Joanna started her own series. These books are way better than the new Thoroughbred books. I love it when Ashleigh and Mona ride in the woods and race on their ponies. It makes me want to get out there and ride my horse too. Anyway, I think it's great that Ashleigh gave Lightning to the Hopewell kids. She thought that they needed her more than she needed her. I can't wait for he new book in the Ashleigh series to come out."
"Positive","MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I have been waiting a long time for this to happen. I have been a big fan of CKs from the start. Her voice then and now has always moved me. When I first heard her sing I knew that she had something special. Back in the 90s she sang Afie on a talk show that Dionne Warwick was on and she blew me away. I was hoping that Afie was on this disk. Anyway this CD is a fine testament to the vocal talents of Chaka Khan. From beginning to end I love ClassiKhan. To Sir With Love and the 2 007 tracks are the best. I believe that 'I Believe' has Grammy written all over it. So if you are a fan of hers this is a must have."
"Positive","Would give it 5 Stars but how would you rate Sgt Peppers: I just made a tape of this album for a friend and he came back saying if not for Ringo's rather weak voice this and a few of his others would really make him the best solo Beatle. That shocked me so I went back and gave it a good listen. You know I love John and Paul but to tell you the truth this really could be the best Solo Beatle album music wise. Time Takes Time I always thought was better but Vertical Man has a polish that is special. Buy this, you will not regret it, be sure to play it a few times before you judge, use headphones if possible.Me in Melbourne, Florida June 2001"
"Positive","Hey..It's star wars so I love it: I understand why everyone is cheesed off about not having the originals release on the blu rays. I personally grew up with the special editions, but my love for star wars grew. I have seen the original and special and well jsut about every release there has been ha ha! I love them all all equal though! I mean come one! It's STAR WARS. The greatest series ever created. I collected the games, books, and movies. I'm so excited to recieve my star wars blu ray saga simply, because I love star wars literally more than anything. It is the ONE thing that I started as a child (6 years old was my first viewing of a new hope on) and managed to keep until present day of 19. SOOOOOOOOOO many things have come and gone during those years, but one thing will stay forever...and that is STAR WARS."
"Positive","Great clamp: Clamps are great quality, only fault I see in them is that the threading on some of them is at an angle, thus it tends to create sideways movement in the material being clamped."
"Negative","made for all sizes: Product is made for just about any size bike tire, so if you have wider tires it will be a little more stable than if you have road tires. Would just like a road version and a wide version."
"Positive","Excellent: For the price these are excellent Headphone. Good sound a really conformtable. I am not a sound techie (yet) but the bass sounds OK and and it has a good mid and high end. I use it to watch movie, play with my Midi instruments."
"Positive","Wonderful!: Another wonderful book by Jan! As usual, I couldn't lay it down 'till I was finished. Wish she would continue the series."
"Positive","FANTASTIC!: Indiana Jones and the Interior World is an outlandish, outrageous fantasy and it makes no apologies for it. There is no need for apologies, this book was a constant thrill ride packed with interesting characters and fascinating locales! This book rocked!"
"Negative","Kindle edition review: Do not buy this book for Kindle, the editing is so poor that it becomes effectively unreadable. I have found this to be a slight problem with other ebooks but never so bad as this. I will try to obtain a refund."
"Negative","Pirates: Just in case you were unsure if this was sold by movie pirates or not, look again at the tag line on the image...they even screwed that up. DO NOT BUY!"
"Positive","art book at its best: this is the first bantock i bought, so this is quite precious for me. i've read the trilogy by borrowing from friends and i regret not having bought them myself. but this book greatly consoles me with the thought that i have an authentic and completely mine, all mine bantock book now! the art works were beautifully chosen for the book and i particularly like the 6-folds puzzle. this is one of the books i would never forget despite its title."
"Negative","Confusing game board play: Being a fan of Mario Party and Shrek Party, I thought Disney's Party would also be enjoyable. Unfortunately, I am irritated that I paid $40 for this thing. The game play is confusing and takes forever to set up and explain, the on-screen text (for the directions) is really hard to read and is extremely verbose.The mini-games are fun once you figure out how to play them, but game play is lame. You don't get to roll dice and move along a board. Instead, there is a little roulette that determines where you go. You have to play a bingo-style game with items and stars and there are these items, ""power notes"" and gems to keep track of (I can't even explain it in a way that isn't extremely confusing).Overly convoluted, confusing, poorly designed and difficult to read - stay away from this and get Mario Party (4 or 5) or Shrek Party."
"Positive","I'M SO NOT JOK...ING: This CD was awesome. I swear, from the moment I popped it into my CD player. At first I was nervous, thinking it would have been a bunch of yucky boring songs. But actually...I was blown away. It is sort of like a Christina Aguilera album, not the lyrics though, but the way the have different music styles in this CD. They have things that teens listen too, and also things that adults listen too as well. I was a little upset because of ""Don't Cry Out Loud"", it wasnt as awesome as the one on television, but other than that...it rocked my socks off."
"Positive","Extraordinary: I must say this is the most wonderful novel that I have ever read. Don't get me wrong, I love my classics. But I must say this is just a masterpiece!The story keeps you turning the pages AND the writing is just extraordinary. What a wonderful author, what an application in the writing, the structuring. What an effort into creating this story, it is just unique!I can't wait for the sequel which is taking too long and keeps being postponed but I can't help thinking that such a book, takes a huge amount of work and Gregory Roberts is one applied writer.You can't write a book like that in two days, can you?"
"Negative","Quiller Got Lost on the Way Home: The Quiller Memorandum takes place back during the cold war. It represented a time and place in history that was true at that time. It accurately depicts an era that is now gone, that some of us lived through.The movie, by today's standards, is a little disjointed and incomplete.It jumps to a conclusion but lacks story development how it got there. Some scenes must have been edited on the cutting room floor back in the 60's or 70's in order to get a G or GP rating. As a result of those incomplete or cut scenes, part of the movie makes no sense. The movie would have been better served if it were produced closer to the author's original book.The most memorable part of the movie is the haunting score, including Matt Monroe's ""Wednesday's Child"". I was disappointed in viewing this movie again some 20 or 30 years later. Perhaps Wolfe was right when he said that we can never go home again. Quiller must have gotten lost on his way home!"
"Positive","The Illusionist soundtrack: The music is beautifully done, it is a unique soundtrack, that enhances the movie. After buyng the CD and later buying the movie I found how the music added a layer of suspense. I really liked this CD, and recommend it."
"Positive","Who can't love Sakamoto Chika?: Arrrgh. This CD is GOOD. I bought mine from an anime shop in Chinatown (NYC). Some of the better songs are Nuriko's, Tasuki's, and Chichiri's. Blah. They're all good. Even Mitsukake's (Yes, really!). You'll crack up when you hear track thirteen, I promise. Overall, this is an excellent CD, even if you don't like Fushigi Yuugi, or you only like the English version. Did I mention that all the character's own voice actors sing? Oh. Also...Each Suzaku Shichiseishi (Celestial warriors of Suzaku) have two songs, except for Chiriko and Mitsukake (they have one). Yui's on there as well, with two songs. BUY IT ALREADY!"
"Negative","Review by a Driving Sim junkie...: Well, maybe my standards are too high in this catagory, but I didn't like Test Drive 6. Or 5, or even 4 for that matter.The cars look good, but they just don't have that thrill of driving that is in other sims. (those who know me know which one I refer to!) The scenery is plain and repetative. Well, I don't like saying too many bad things about a game, so I will end here.Go buy Need for Speed....and no I don't work for Electronic Arts!Spin"
"Negative","Midland Stinks: This unit had an attractive price, so against the opinions of several CBers I bought it. It would not work right out of the box, It would power up, BUT NO TRANSMIT OR RECEIVE capabililities. Rather than go throught the hassle of sending it back I took it to a very reputable CB repair shop with over 40 years of CB experience. After running up a $40 bill, was told that a major power component was non functional right from the factory. So much for Midland Quality Control. I placed the Midland 5001Z in the trash where it belongs and ended up buying a Cobra CB which I was told by friends to do in the first place, Midland had this one chance to impress me right out of the box and failed miserably. Midland....YOU STINK."
"Negative","Sad old man mooches & thieves his way across the arctic: This book is like a train wreck. You want to do the decent thing and turn away but the gore is too compelling. This is a poorly written journal of an egotistical fool that mooched, sponged and thieved his way across the arctic. There was no-one that this creep wouldn't use, and when he's quite justifiably refused ""good samaritan"" help, he rants and raves about how unfair it all is.His writing is nothing more than egocentric drivel about how brilliant and brave he is. Nothing about the beauty, the people or the history.The journey was remarkable, but Starkells stupidity, incompetance, lack of planning and astonishing lack of ethics are a study on how not to make this type of journey. His methods of resupply consisted of sponging off people who likely couldn't afford it and stealing the rest.Please don't buy this book. It might encourage this idiot to go kayaking again."
"Positive","play script purchase: The book was shipped in a timely fashion and arrived in the condition i expected. the seller is most reliable and i would purchase other merchandise from him again."
"Positive","A whole new way of talking: One of the most remarkable books of verse in a long while; out of nowhere this poet appears and challenges conventions of meaning and narration. She works with large phrases, and marshalls them with the austere disjunctions of Language Poetry -- but all the while an intense discourse is going on, not trivialized by glib transfer of emotions or by narrative frames. Instead, the work seems to renew, refresh. Imagine abstract language that has the impact of imagery and you get some of the flavor of this book. Every poem in the collection speaks into human space -- but never with condescension or phony lyricsim. Carefully, sentence by sentence, exploring all sorts of pause and interruption, Siegel builds up an intricate and unforgettable experience-in-hearing."
"Positive","Fresh and Rewarding: If you've read any of the other reviews, you'd know the basic plot line, so I won't rehash it. I only wanted to let everyone know that this is a really terrific novel. The two characters actually talk to and appreciate each other. None of the ridiculous misunderstandings that are so common in romance literature occur here. Even more refreshing and unusual are the main characters who are not the typical patronizing womanizer and an immature and petulant female. Definitely get your hands on this book."
"Positive","Awesome bust at a good price: This is a great likeness of donkey. My fiance is a huge Shrek fan and isn't a huge fan of ""dust collectors"" (most of my star wars statues and busts are relegated to the media room :) However, even she fell in love with this bust and proudly displays it next to her laptop. It's not quite up to the quality of some of your nicer Gentle Giant busts (especially a tiny bit sloppy in some of the paint application) which is why I give it only 4 stars instead of the full 5. However, it still looks great, has a great sculpt, and it highly recommended for the inexpensive prices offered here on amazon."
"Positive","Good: This game is fun, the graphics are very good so is the sound.Single player is fun to go through and complete but the best part is definately the multiplayer part of the game. Online gaming is sweet, it is well worth purchasing this game. However there is NO splitscreen play on this game which is the biggest problem for people that don't have XBOX live or anyone that rarely has a lan party.If you decide to get this game I suggest that you also get XBOX Live if you don't already have it."
"Positive","Power to burn!: This is probably one of the best Subwoofers that I have ever owned. It has too much power in my opinion but when looking for a good driven unit who can ever say that more is too much? Performance is awesome and I could blow the walls apart with it it would seem. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a great companion to a 5.1 system and up (I am using with 7.2)!!"
"Positive","Classic Sherlock Holmes: Ronald Howard does a wonderful Sherlock Holmes and H. Marion Crawford playing Watson. These shows were all produced to last under 30 minutes, yet they do a wonderful job of giving an entertaining performance.Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Series"
"Positive","can't go wrong with Kingston!: great little card. I'm using it in my Nokia 6300 phone. no noticable delay when accessing the card (games, pics, downloads, playback). I am definitely a fan of Kingston products. I also use their memory in my pc."
"Negative","Don't buy if you are sensitive to animal cruelty: As I said in the title of my review, don't buy this book if you don't like animal cruelty. I was saddened to read very descriptive accounts of animals being trapped in leg traps and then struggling to get free. They may have been there for days before finally being killed. Sorry, but I just think it is cruel to catch animals in leg traps and snares."
"Positive","Powerful attitude changing steps: Really enjoyed reading this book. Beleive it will help change my life. Becuase attitude is everything. I truely beleive that statement. Must have for the person who wants to be a winner in life. Great for a person who thinks negatively all the time."
"Negative","DO NOT BUY this product,its a total disappointment!: This product is total waste. I tried to cut onions with it and really had to exert some immense pressure to cut onions! Moreover, after so much pressure, the onions lost most of the juice. I tried to cut tomato with it, it was easy cutting the tomato, but most of the juice came out leaving the tomato mostly with the skin! I returned the product and thanks to Amazon, they returned me full refund."
"Negative","Worthless without an index: You would think the company that produced the disk could provide an crossreference between the sound effect and the meaningless name assigned to it on their DVD."
"Positive","blue planet: Fantastic. How amazing and what great things are found and continue to be found in this small and unque part of God's creation."
"Negative","BAD!: This game stinks, flat out. The single player is WAY too short and the story is messed up. This stupid little computer follows you around half the game and if you shoot it you lose. This games is nothing like 007, in that is stinks! Multiplayer is bad too cause everything lags."
"Positive","An old, old friend....: Whenever I travel through the hills of SW Wisconsin I keep an eye open for Enoch Wallace's house. Simak has me convinced that it, and its owner, must be real. You cannot read this book without feeling that Enoch is an old, old friend. There is something about this 19th century man's lonely vigil through the centuries that seems right. Only a person so completely human could treat alien visitors with such unstinting hospitality- and humanity. They are just ""folks"", a might peculiar, but still folks. I can also believe that the old timers back in the hills would not give him up to outsiders if he did exist- not if he minded his own business, not if he belonged there."
"Positive","emerging Dick Francis: For Dick Francis fans this book will bring back memories of his earlier novels. Great entertainment, nice snuggle down with on a rainy day book"
"Positive","great cd, though on the short side: This cd is one of the best cd I have ever heard, though I like Fumbling Towards Ecstacy more. The lyrics of the songs ""Adia"" and ""Angel"" are very touching. The reason why I gave this cd 4 stars instead of 5, is the unnecessary enhanced cd option, which doesn't contribute much to this cd except for some cheap commercials of those other cd's of Sarah. Pity."
"Negative","Bad singing, bad songs, bad everything.: I picked up this CD for $1.95, when i was hunting for random dance music for my collection. let me tell you: it wasn't worth it. this band is an assault on my ears. i'm not someone who is obessessed with interesting or even good music. but this is really the pits. in all likelihood, if you don't know them personally, are sane, and are over 12, you will probably hate VCR with a passion. I can really not see dancing to any of this. the lyrics are absolutely terrible. the synth sounds are cheesy and have badly written parts. the singing isn't even singing, it's just yelling semi-rythmically. and i'm a fan of hip-hop. but this is just bad. i urge you to not buy this CD. just look at the fact that as of now, some people are trying to sell it for a quarter here on amazon."
"Negative","Had Two and Both Failed: I sooo wanted this to work as I live in the hurricane belt and it just seemed so handy. The first one I got worked well for about 6 months and then it gripped the lid and would not let go. I finally got it to release the lid. The next time I used it ...it WOULD NOT LET THE LID GO --- no matter what I tried, so I ended up running it in the garage until the batteries ran out (as you cannot get into the battery compartmen when it is running). Hoping I just had bad luck .. I got another one .. this one only lasted a month and the same sort of problem... it did not finish the perimeter of the can and just stopped dead -- still attached to the can. No matter what I tried I could not get it to let go. With this model I COULD open the battery compartment .. I pulled the batteries and ended up opening the can manually ... spooning the food into a dish and then throwing the thing away .. still attached to the can --- there was no way it was going to let go of it. Very frustrating."
"Negative","Save your money.: It happened to me too. The handle broke right off. Odds don't look to good for this product. Wish I'd read these reviews BEFORE I bought mine."
"Positive","This did work.: If you have the model number and it corresponds to the description, this will definitely work for you, so don't hesitate to get it."
"Negative","I guess you HAD TO BE THERE: I don't see anything new in this film, honestly. It's a little less than what I expected, and it's very cliche. I don't understand why people think because a film is indie, it has lower standards...or that the indie viewer has lower standards.As usual, you can tell that this film is full of amusing one-liners and inside jokes that the cast and crew may be aware of, but as the viewer, don't waste my time. If you ""had to be there"" to understand it, then save it for your home movies! I personally am insulted. This was a hack film."
"Negative","Too stiff: These spatulas are way too stiff for me. They don't bend to the shape of the container you're scraping like I want them to, so lots of the batter (or whatever) stays in the bowl. I much prefer the ones I have from Pampered Chef."
"Negative","Overrated in every way = Disappointed: Quentin Tarantino has an issue with self-indulgence this time around. There are a few scenes that seem like they could've been cut out in the editing room without a problem, or at least shortened. Nothing of any real significance appears to be going on, and whether or not these moments get better in any repeat viewing, they can come off as extremely pointless. The only thing exciting about this movie is when the woman pulled the other woman's eye out."
"Positive","Awesome for All Ages: Don't let the Disney name fool you-this movie is great for all ages. I'm 14 years old and my parents gave me this for Christmas. It's a hilarious movie about a doll named Eve (Tyra Banks) who comes to life and into the life of Casey (Lindsay Lohan), a young tomboy who was hoping to bring her mother back to life. The movie is all about Eve exploring her world and figuring out what the real-world is like. Eve's unawareness of the world around her gets her into more than a few funny predicaments. If you'd like a good laugh at a girly movie, you'll love Life-Size."
"Positive","Very well done: W. Stevens is actually the departed person I think most about missing. Just browsing through his book, I learned more about networking and network programming than I have from any other place. Any implemtation, no matter the language or platform, is relatively transparent after reading this book.He gives a great deal of himself in all his books I've read; sharing the little test programs he writes to finally pin down how something is implemented. And he did all the grunt work of communicating with people like Kernighan and Ritchie to elucidate some points that are not found in books.This is a very good teacher of his field, which happens to be perhaps the most explosive field of this time."
"Positive","Great old tunes!: Makes me pleased that I sang to my daughter so often as now she can relate to these old folk songs and sing along with my grandson. I think this is the one that has ""She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes..."" and little Zak gets such a kick out of ""Whoa back,"" ""Toot Toot"" etc. Wonderful exposure for a little one!"
"Negative","NOT Compatible with c330.: The website encourages you to purchase this part with your c330. This presents two big problems:1. You don't need it!2. It is not compatible with the c330!Somebody needs to fix this on the website."
"Positive","Funny but disappointing ending: I laughed out loud reading this book until the middle part. I too had hoped that her boyfriend was not the ""devil"" but from what I gethered in the ending he was. Truly disappointing ending. I would have given it a five had it not been for the ending. How could such a light read become so heavy in the end."
"Negative","A dollar a minute? No thanks.: I'm writing this to ensure that other folks don't make the mistake I did. I got all excited that the Christmas special was out - only to realize I one-clicked a 2 minute prequel.Yes, yes - I should have read the description better, but I've been buying Doctor Who episodes from Amazon for awhile and they've trained me to know that prequels, sneak peeks, etc. are free and episodes run around $1.99 to $2.99. It didn't even occur to me that I'd be buying a 2 minute prequel that is available legally elsewhere online for free and get charged $2 for it."
"Negative","DO NOT BUY THIS: I bought this scale before I thought about checking on line reviews, BIG MISTAKE. I paid a lot of money for it thinking it would be great to measure my weight loss. After all it is Weight Watchers brand. IT NEVER WEIGHS THE SAME TWICE. What I mean by this is that I can get on it, step off, and get back on and not get the same reading. And we are talking about pounds different. I tried three times this morning and each time I got a different reading. Again, that is stepping off and on, so I didn't move the scale or do anything different. This product SUCKS."
"Negative","PASS THE PROZAC!: Why are books about life in the Southern USA almost always so depressing? Are they still in a funk about losing the war? They need to get over it!Reading this book is like wading through a vat of taffy--slow, and laborious, with no point. If I want to be depressed reading about the south, I'll read Faulkner's LIGHT IN AUGUST. At least it's a classic."
"Positive","It was good but it could have been a little better.: The ending was a little predictable and a bit too quick in time changes. I would give it a thumbs up on the strong characters, primarily Holly, David and Howard. I loved the strong accuracy in terms of the White House. It's good, worth staying up nights."
"Positive","A pinnacle: This is beautiful elegant mathematics. I have read much of this beautiful book and Stein and Weiss's companion book on Singular Integrals. If you want to know harmonic analysis, own these and spend many hours with them."
"Negative","I am the only dummy out there: I bought this product based on the reviews. I have a 60"" Sony HDTV LCD with an HDMI connection and a brand new Sony upscaling DVD player. I thought I just needed to plug it in on both ends, and it would work.It didn't. Nothing works, no video, no audio. Not sure what you can do wrong with one cable and one way to plug it in on each item."
"Negative","Twenty-year-old information lacks relevance: This book was an assigned reading for a Women's Studies class in which I am enrolled. While I found some of the thoughts presented to be insightful, I was upset with the inclusion of old information. Most of the studies cited were from the 1980's, with some being over twenty years old. I do believe there is still a major problem in this country with oppression (gender and racial). However, I feel that great strides have been made in the last two decades, and to present old, outdated information only serves to reopen old wounds.The copyright on this book is 2004. I am truly disappointed that the supporting data used gives a distorted view of the presentation."
"Positive","A bit of Sunshine in a Box: I had an Auntie Mame in my life and before she died recently I gave her a copy of this movie and we watched it together and laughed and reminisced together and just enjoyed the movie and each other's company. Then she was gone. I'll always treasure that day and the memories I made with my Auntie Mame. Don't pass up an opportunity to enjoy true entertainment - and have a few tissues handy too!"
"Negative","Hope springs eternal: I would truly, truly like to review this book, in either a negative vein, or glowing positively - thrilled with it's boundless content. Unfortunately, I haven't actually received the book in question, so there's really not a lot to say. In my heart I keep hoping that it will be delivered one day, any day, sooner rather than later would be nice. And, after the headlong rush of reading and absorbing the copious content (it's a big book after all I've been told), I hold addional hope that I will still have sufficient drive to get that real review out the door and on to the pages of Amazon where it belongs. Maybe next month - see you then!"
"Positive","Great price and easy to use: I love this radar detector...it was a GREAT price, super easy to use, and very effective!! I didnt buy the mount, i just placed non-skid material, on my dash, and it works great!! It keeps me alert and aware when im on the road!!"
"Negative","Big Deal: Beloved gets my nomination for the most overpraised work of literature in recent years. P.C. or not, I question whether the work would have received a fraction of the accolades had it not been written by an otherwise very talented African-American woman, but admit it: Beloved is ponderous and rather dull. One can sympathize intensely with the suffering of the type of people portrayed without agreeing that the book is particularly entertaining. A must-read only for those who feel they ""must."""
"Positive","A ""must"" for COLLECTORS only!: I'm not one to put down the Green God, per se, but this is basically for collectionist freaks like myself. Peter was pretty out of it during these sessions, but the bonus tracks are the bomb. Check out the electric take on the Apostle instrumental he wrote to for his Grandmother. It really is nice to finally get about 95% of his solo post-Mac stuff available and digitally remastered with great liner notes from Jet Celmins(Green's authorized biographer). Give it a shot ONLY if you want to complete your Greenie collection! Hope this helps any of you PG fans!!!"
"Negative","Traumatized 15 years later: I read this book when I was 12, and it's left a lasting impression all these years- I'm almost 30 now. That's not a compliment. As an adult, I realize that life is full of unexplained, meaningless tragedy, but the way this book wallows in it is prurient and grotesque. A hardened adult would be stupified by the ending where a child dies alone of starvation and thirst. But to aim this at children? It is cruel beyond all understanding. Not because I think children and teens can't accept death- Bridge to Terabethia was one of the most beautiful books I ever read. But this was like the Saw movies for the middle school set- long, drawn out psychological torture for no reason, with no purpose or redeeming value. Those reviews about the ""clarity of mind"" she experiences are bulls**t. Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy. Would love to ask the author, WTF?"
"Negative","I am glad others finally share my long held view: I have seen these shag sacks many times and in many clubs in London, they are the most pathetic effort of a band I have ever witnessed, only really liked by people who have no time to listen to music, and get there judgement in musical taste from the NME."
"Positive","This Product is Well Worth the Money!: This product is well worth the money. I love it! Bought it 6 months ago and has worked perfectly. The programming took me a few minutes to get the hang of it, but as long as you read the directions, the set-up can be done in just a few minutes. Once programmed, it does it's thing. Feeds my cat 3 times a day and he no longer wakes me up at 5 am for his breakfast. Been working on the same batteries for 6 months now, and still haven't had to change them. I am very pleased with this feeder and would recommend it to anyone!!!"
"Negative","Not all change is good: I wasted $34 bucks ordering this PPV, and let me tell you that bringing in Hogan was the BIGGEST mistake TNA Wrestling can make. They brought in Hogan thinking that he is the answer, when he's not. He's on of the guys that Killed WCW, and once he came in along came all the wcw guys who killed wcw..I am big WWE fan, but I liked TNA because some of their stuff WAS better then WWE.. So I watched this PPV wondering how much change hogan was bringing... let me just say.. 5 minutes in.. I didn't know if I was watching TNA or WCW...this dvd is not worth anything. its bad."
"Negative","Joke Book: The book is a joke. The levitation ellusion is ridiculous and may work if you are on a stage with lots of props to draw their attention away from what you are doing."
"Negative","Was good until it got religious: I was enjoying this book as an easy, fun read even though it was not totally capturing my attention, until a third of the way through it suddenly got religious. The characters all started talking about their faith in God, etc. It was literally every other sentence. I had no idea this was a ""Christian"" novel or I wouldn't have started reading it. Good thing I got it for free. I am surprised that the author waited until almost the middle to start preaching. I really didn't see that coming. Definitely not going to finish it and deleted it from my device. Unless you are into reading a novel that kind of tricks you into reading it only to then try to preach to you, don't bother."
"Negative","Incomplete Shipment: The diapers were fine except my order was for 124 diapers and I only received 112. I also didn't have any way of contacting the shipper to let them know that my order was incomplete."
"Negative","Extremely disappointing: The fact of the matter is that the quality of this recording is poor, and the instrument(s) were not tuned properly on all keys, and there were mis-notes, and there were off-tempo stanzas in the passages. Extremely disappointing. Not a CD one would wish to keep. Hard to understand from DG."
"Negative","Universal Remote Control: The Philips PM4S 4 device Universal Remote Control is a nice looking remote. It is easy to program with one drawback. The list of devices is somewhat extensive. It is easy to connect with different devices once they are programed.The one disadvantage that I have found is that some television sets are not in the programing instructions, and the auto program feature does not work well with the unlisted set I had. I was not able to program that tv into the remote control. I would have to think twice before recommending tis item to others."
"Negative","Very disappointed: After reading all the reviews I purchased this for my boyfriend for his birthday because he's been wanting a pair of wireless headphones for months. I received two headsets and returned both because of extremely poor reception. Laying in bed, 5 feet from the receiver, the headphone volume would inexplicably drop after about 5 minutes of listening. Sometimes turning the TV on and off would fix it. We thought the first set might be defective but then the second set did the exact same thing. Too bad... I'll be looking for another set."
"Positive","The album's title says it all: You can tell they were tired from the craziness of the mania just by looking at their forlorn faces on the cover.Despite the beyond hellish touring they were doing in 1963 and 1964, along with all the appearances on TV shows and the countless photo shoots and radio interviews they were obliged to do, Lennon-McCartney managed to squeeze in more classic compositions on this album: ""No Reply,"" ""I'm A Loser,"" and ""Baby's In Black,"" for example, brought home the point that they were in burnout mode. The number of covers they included on this (7, counting the medley of ""Kansas City"" and ""Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey"" as two songs) was the most they had of any other album.Again, I tend to shy away from their earlier work (I like things from Rubber Soul onwards, except the ""White Album"") but I enjoy Beatles for Sale because of the depth of the Lennon-McCartney tunes."
"Negative","A weak debut: Olivia (or Oliver as she is known to her Greenwich Village friends) Brown is the kind of historical female sleuth that readers of this genre would love to love. Unfortunately, beyond telling us that this is 1920 Greenwich Village and the Prohibition puts a cramp in the artistic lifestyle, author Annette Meyers does little to evoke a true sense of place. The dialogue reads as very 1990s and I was surprised to read that a character attended a lecture by the famous woman rights advocate Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who died in 1902.The plot is also weak, centering on a case of obsession. I thought that the perpetrator was very obvious and that a young woman who had already been involved in some detective work would have pulled everything together much quicker.I may take a look at Meyers's planned sequel, but it will have to be a whole lot better for me to read the whole thing."
"Negative","Should have closed out of town: This is one of those movies that apparently nobody has a neutral opinion on. It's either a cinematic masterpiece or a turkey. I gravitate toward the second opinion.The story, as such, concerns a couple who arrive in New York and have everything possible go wrong. It could have been funny, but Jack Lemmon- who I usually like- misses totally. Instead of being a sympathetic character, his constant bitching and whining about every misfortune becomes irritating, and eventually you don't care if anything happens to him. You almost want someone to finish him off and end the movie.Sandy Dennis, who I always considered to be an adequate- not great- actress, actually hits the marks better, and her character is much more likeable.Beware. Rent this one before you buy it."
"Positive","A blend of beauty and magic!: This CD is magical, the lyrics are deep. I've been a Lauryn Hill fan from the way back days of the Fugees and she's simply AWESOME. It's no surprise she nabbed 5 Grammys from this album, her first solo. This represents what good music should be, just buy it and listen to it's magic!!! To say the truth, this album deserves 10 stars!!! Lauryn, I thank God for your life and inspiration, keep up the good work!!!"
"Negative","Do not Buy: This device is poorly designed, as soon as you crank up the power of the blower to a sufficient level to actually suck up debris either the hose will fly out of the canvas cover or the cover will fly off the collector. Shooting chopped leaves all over the place. My kids thought it was great! Do not buy unless you are willing to play around with it an dget frustrated. By the time you figure it out with clamps, wire ties, and duct tape you could have just used the bag that comes with the blower and been finished."
"Negative","Not the set pictured! - July, 2011: Be aware that though the set is an excellent value at $19.99 it does NOT come with the elaborate box case pictured. It is in a simple flimsy box sleeve.A great deal for seven awesome films with outstanding extras on the discs, but if you want the elaborate box pictured do NOT purchase this from Amazon."
"Negative","Great at first, but doesn't last: I purchased this set for use on the bike I use for commuting to work every day. At first, I was very impressed by how bright the light was, and very happy with the product.However, after a few months (a couple hundred miles worth of riding on Chicago streets), the lights (first the front, then the rear) would start to go out after I hit a bump in the road. Turning them off and on or jiggling the light a little would turn them back on, but after a little while they'd go off again. Eventually they just didn't work anymore. I tried replacing the batteries to no avail, so I think something just came loose in the light. Unfortunately there is no easy way to open up the light to make a repair.So I've decided that, while these lights probably work fine in nicer conditions, they're just not tough enough for a commuter bike."
"Positive","Get the Cool Shoe-Shine!: The GORILLAZ newest single, 19/2000, hit stores this summer. While listening to it, I was amazed at its contents - each track was completely different from the other, providing variety on even a small CD single. It has a little something for everyone, whether you like rock, soul, dance, hip-hop, or pop. I think that this little album is a true work of art that is rarely found in today's pop music."
"Positive","divorce care: Excellent book. My church uses this in a divorce care class. Recommend to anyone recovering from the process of divorce."
"Positive","Perfect Performance 2 for 2: This is my second tender of the same model. The first is about 7 years old and still going strong. When I purchased a motorcycle last year, I purchased a second so the bike didn't have to share with the mower.No surprises here. A ten minute set up and the charger was up and running. the clamps work great for the mower, and the terminal connections are used on the bike. The first mower battery has lasted 6 years and was just replaced. Previously we replaced the batteries in the mower every other year. This model has a minimum set of features and we thought was a great value."
"Positive","Great Bedtime Story: I recommend this book as a bedtime story for young children. It is particularly fun if you act out the actions of the characters. I often give this as a baby shower gift."
"Negative","Bait and switch!: This book had me at ""hello""! Unfortunately, it couldn't live up to its strong start. I read the whole thing to see how it ended... but I enjoyed so little about this book, that I'm really surprised by all the hooplah it's received. It was boring, had many hard-to-believe plot twists, and I just couldn't get into (or even like!) any of the characters. There was nothing satisfying about this book on any level. Yawn."
"Positive","A Good Time Waster (But Not In A Bad Way): I've noticed that this game really is a lot of fun and is something short and sweet to play when you have nothing else to do. At this low price, it's the best entertainment you could have. The graphics are fantastic, but the acting as always, is terrible. If you ever wanted to have the arcade brought home, this is it.The coolest part is that you can unlock House of the Dead II after you beat #3. Both are very fun. Two games for $20 is a great buy, $10 a game. Get it!"
"Negative","Turkey is the right word for this book: I have read all of Ms. Braun's books and this is by far the most boring. She has all the qualities and characters of Pickax, but the murder mystery seems an after thought~ stuck in there after the book was written. She seems much more concerned about telling about the history of the ""Great Storm of 1912"" than interesting her mystery readers. It's about time Quill and Polly got a life, else her readers will."
"Positive","Funniest Book Ever: This book, without a doubt, is the most hysterically funny thing I have ever read. Dali is some kind of weird comic genius, and I am not exaggerating when I say that I laughed out loud on every page. Whatever you think of Dali's art--and I've never thought much of it myself--this book is a guaranteed laugh riot."
"Positive","TITAN really sets the stage: I must say up front that I am not from Lethbridge Alberta. As a matter of fact, I would think that the general populace of that godforsaken burg would take to hiding.To get back to the heart of the matter I have to congratulate the compilers of said album/collection. I realize that when choosing tunes for a flick such as this one must be critical, but by God they have really struck a cord here. A few solid tunes wrapped up with a multitude of the whimsy, what what more could you ask for. I for one have laid down some good money only to be tossed a wretched CD that carries the tune of perhaps one useful piece of music.This CD does more than that. Buy the thing. I must now digress and say that I first heard the album on Napster. God willing they will be there for the next great flick. Take care.Paul"
"Negative","If I could have given this CD a zero...: I'm not a hard person to please, but this CD makes me want to vomit. If you are looking for 12 songs that sound the same, then this is your CD. If you're looking for something with a little variety, look elsewhere. I am a huge fan of Clay's, but was very disappointed with this CD. If you've heard one of the songs, you've pretty much heard them all."
"Negative","OMG...Only the gore was good,the movie SUCKED: I bought this DVD casue of all the psitive reviews it got.what a WASTE.the only good thing about this movie was the gore/melting effects.the movie itself was dumb and pointless with no real plot what so ever.how anyone can give this five stars is beyond me.rent if your courious otherwise dont bother."
"Negative","You left out some of the best songs!: Unfortunately, I was looking forward to purchasing the ""Something's Gotta Give"" soundtrack until I looked at the track listings and saw that you left out two very important songs: ""Butterfly"" by Crazytown and Maroon 5. The cd would have been so much better with these two songs on it!"
"Negative","Help-a question, not a review: I have read many of the reviews but none specifically mention the chin. Can you use it on the chin/face? Is it effective on the coarse black hairs?"
"Negative","Hopeless Book: I bought this book after I read so many glowing recommendations, but when I stated reading reading this book , I realized that it was a hopeless book. Somehow I managed to read the whole book ( because I had spent some hard earned money in buying it) . The author says that as per Authobiography of a Yogi, Mahavatar Babji was initiated by Lord Krishna. This is absolutely wrong, Paramhansa Yogananda never wrote such things in his Autobiography. Besides the author Dr Donald Schnell had shown Mahavatar Babaji speaking english very poorly. This is unpalatable to any literary or spiritual taste. Besides that, Dr Schnell talks more of his wife than he talks about his so called Babji. In a nut shell, the kind of spiritual vibrations and compassion I feel in reading books of Yogananda, they were completely missing in this book ""The Initiation"" by Dr Schnell.I did not enjoy reading this book and I will NOT recommend this book."
"Positive","Just the baby memory book I was hoping for!: The Big Book of Me was such a great find. I was looking for a baby memory book that was simple enough to fill out (so I would actually stick with it) and aesthetically pleasing. This one totally fits the bill. Inside, there are sweet quotations from poets and classic children's books. The illustrations have a vintage feel. There is plenty of space to write, and lots of places for you to paste pictures. All in all, it's very charming. I do want to add that the color of the checks on the cover are yellow, not blue, contrary to the picture above. That wasn't a problem for me--I think it's just as adorable--but I thought I'd let you know!"
"Negative","Misleading Product Information: Please be aware that this is not as currently** described in the Product Description:""Pack of ten best-selling Bookworms ideal for building up class libraries. Each Pack contains one copy of each listed title. * The Adventures of Tom Sawyer * The Elephant Man * A Little Princess * Love or Money? * The Monkey's Paw * The Phantom of the Opera * The President's Murderer * Sherlock Holmes and the Duke's Son * White Death * The Wizard of Oz ""Those above two sentences led me to believe that I would receive exactly that -- 10 books, a copy of each title, to add to my class library. When a newspaper has a grammatically awkward headline, it can be funny. On the other hand, a grammatically messed-up product description results in a lot of hassle in having to return something that ended up being way over-priced for a single, skinny-little reader title.**As on the date of this review."
"Negative","Worth a Buy for the Fan: No Ghost ? Really....The KISSfaq.com states that this book was ""Ghost-written by Ben Greenman, editor of ""The New Yorker""...""the Kissfaq.com has rarely been wrong, not ever as far as I know.And Yes, I did Purchase the HardBack, as well as the Paperbacks."
"Positive","GREAT EPISODE, GREAT BOOK: This book is based on one of the greatest TV episodes. You see, the twins finds out a famous teen magazine in coming to town to find a model for the front cover. Of course, Ashley (the fashion lover) really wants to be this model. Mary-Kate (the more tom-boy one) just thinks in would be cool to get off school to shoot the pictures. But Mary-Kate is chosen. What will Ashley do about this? Read the book and find out."
"Negative","WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This is not a movie, it's a bunch of people talking about WHAT HAPPENED, sort of like an interview......If I had the option for ZERO stars then this crap would qualify. I mean I do not hate the documentary because it is factual stuff but the movie info was totally misleading!"
"Positive","Round and Round: I would like to put 4.5 stars but cannot.This book was definitely worth my time. Everyone knows who Magellan is, but very few know the details of his voyage. This book fills in all the gaps of your history textbook and brings the story alive. Thankfully the story of securing the voyage and the political machinations involved is fairly quick and the author gets right to Magellan's voyage. The more that you read the better the book gets.I highly recommend this book both for entertainment and enlightenment about an important part of history.My one criticism is that the author neglects to use maps in the book. Maybe this is to have the reader feel just like the men on this voyage - utterly lost as to where they are. Make sure that you have an Atlas to refer to as you read this book."
"Negative","the very first paragraph of the very first entry is wrong: The Jewish Bible and the Christian Bible are not the same book. Referring to the Jewish Bible as having/being the ""Old Testament"" is not only inaccurate, it is extremely disrespectful. That such a glaring error appears in a third edition should be an embarassment.I shudder to think what errors lurk on less well known topics."
"Positive","Great Investment: Even though the price is a bit steep, this is a great mat to replace the cheap ones you find in any store. I am ready to invest in some of the mat spray and I already bought the great Manduka towel."
"Negative","Kind of weak, but pleasant anyway: This album sounded uninspired. Don't get me wrong, I love Journey, and I have this album. The two best songs are the first and last (a bonus track). ""Message Of Love"" sounds like a leftover from Frontiers. The musicianship on this CD is tight and performed well. It's just that it is kind of boring, I expected a little more. It couldn've happened with another release WITH Steve Perry. I knew that if they had one more chance after Trial that we'd have a 4 or 5 star album on our hands. Unfortunately, that isn't gonna happen."
"Positive","Nice and Light: The Boxwave Evertouch is an amazing stylus. It flows smoothly on my ipad 2 screen. It's light weight meaning I can control it without stressing my hands, especially when drawing with precision. Compared to other brand styli, the Evertouch's fibermesh fabric tip is sturdy and works great without using a lot of pressure. You don't have to worry about it ripping/bending like those styli that have rubberized/cotton tips. I for one am very satisfied with the results and I would definitely suggest this to others."
"Positive","Fabulous: Clint Eastwood does a great job directing this film and Jessica Walters plays her part very well. The ""Misty"" song is one of my favorites so it was interesting to see that it was the evil character's favorite as well. Well done.Stan"
"Positive","Red - End Of Silence: The Up Side: Melodic hard rock layered with classical instrumetals and a Linkin Park-esque atmosphere. Good vocals, clean production and easily accessible lyrics. Also, many of the songs here run past the 5 minute mark, breaking the cycle of 3 1/2 minute radio ready slush.The Down Side: Only 9 songs! Already Over (part II) is a reprise of the original (i.e you'll be skipping it), and Intro isn't a song at all. In addition, not every song on End Of Silence is as strong as the first two singles.The Flip Side: Those who otherwise wouldn't listen to alternative metal will be drawn in by the heavy use of violin, piano and digital track in each composition.The Conclusion: End Of Silence is a worty listen while we wait for new material from Chevelle, Linkin Park and 10 Years.The End."
"Negative","Bad overall, do not buy this.: I had this for around 2 years, i thought it was working. I had thought it was doing its job.The wiring in my house is old, and the previous owner left surge protector outlet plugs on every outlet in the house.I plugged in this surge protector to the outlet, until 1 week ago when I removed the previous owner's surge protector outlet plug. So this surge protector was the only thing protecting my computer.Well , what do you know , because 1 week later my computer was dead. The motherboard was fried. After turning off the power to my house for work to be done, then turning it back on, my computer which cost over a thousand was completely dead.I do not recommend this product, I do not suggest anyone to buy it. It is a terrible piece of flimsy hardware, and if you look on the internet, you'll find reports of this appliance catching on fire, and stuff like that.I went to walmart , bought 2 surge protectors and am about to ship this one back. I doubt i'll get compensation."
"Negative","If this guy wasn't 7 feet tall....: ....he'd be flipping burgers. Like Charles Barkley (who -- big surprise -- is one of his best buddies), Jayson Williams is a self-important blowhard who uses his status as a minor celebrity as a platform to dispense his childish anecdotes and mind-numbing personal opinions. Here's an example of his brilliant insight: if you turn out the lights, any woman can be Cindy Crawford. Wow! Thanks for the tip, Jayson!"
"Positive","Great gun except the price: this is a good gun and needed for any airsoft war but it is slightly over priced i bought a clone for under $300 on airsplat which is slightly better because it comes upgraded and it comes with the 2400 round electric box mag"
"Positive","This is so much fun,and tastes GREAT: In tough times, with EVERYONE so serious and either sad or mad-- why not offer up a bit of Mac and Cheese comfort food hope?The charming package design makes this a 'just because' gift for a friend or coworker.The best part of this is the superior quality, and outstanding taste. Get some now!~"
"Negative","Amazon sent one full of holes!!!: I love this shower and wanted a new one so bought one. Unfortunately did NOT find out it had 9 holes until I needed it. By the time I got home from my vacation, the ""return window had expired"".So, if you buy one of these from Amazon, check it out right away for holes and punctures. I didn't and am stuck with a dud!"
"Positive","Eye Opening: I thought this book was very well written and truly opens the mind to different viewpoints. A good read."
"Positive","ROBERT RULES!: I first saw Robert and The Family Band on Eric Clapton's Crossroad's DVD (the one in Texas) and he flat wowed me! This is unusual for me now. You see, I'm an old hippie guy and most things new suck (to me). This kid is playing slide like Duane Allman and he's doing it on a George Jones backup pedal steel country friggin' guitar. I buy everything he releases now. I actually had an opportunity to see him locally in a VERY small venue and he and the bass player were walking around in the crowd getting folks to repeat a ""hook"" in the song he was singing. Very high energy live and he won't disappoint you with this CD either!"
"Positive","I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!: This movie has everything... suspense, humor and ADVENTURE! As a kid I loved watching this movie! I remember when I was little me and my brother wanted to runaway to California to play in a video game championship. Man what memories this movie brings back! I would say if you loved playing the Nintendo you will love this movie. Buy it! The only thing is the movie does have some curse words in certain parts of the movie. So be aware if you don't want little ones hearing that. But other than that it's great for the whole family. I highly recommend this movie to everyone!!!!!!"
"Positive","Reasonably Funny, Odd Movie Style: I saw the first Hangover and it was really funny. This one was pretty good, but didn't seem as funny as the first one. It WAS funny, but I think I liked the first one more. The story line was entertaining and the movie was worth seeing. When it comes to movies, I generally have low expectations and never get caught up in analyzing plots, characters, etc. If it's entertaining, I'll finish the movie ... regardless of whether or not the film has a ""meaningful plot"" or ""complex characters"". I recommend this movie for a good laugh."
"Negative","She loved it for about 2 hours: We have a small female boxer and she loved this toy. It seemed like it would be very durable. Unfortunately it proved to be much less durable than it appeared. Within two hours of use she had torn one of the ends off and removed the plastic water bottle (the source of the crackle and crunch) from inside. Too bad. I had high hopes for this one."
"Positive","This book really moves!: The action in this book will keep you turning pages right up until the end. Written in the first person, this book gets you intimately involved with the protagonist early on.The main character, Jim Marshall, is very well drawn. He's crusty around the edges, taking anti-anxiety medication and having gunfights with terrorists!The writing is well done and the ending is absolutely spectacular! Very believable conclusion and the personal ending is both touching and humorous. Highly recommended! I'm looking forward to the sequel."
"Positive","This is the best book of all time.: This is the best book of all time...by far. Not only the best Tolkien book, but the best book ever. All of the boring, unnecessary detail is cut out and it becomes a greater work of art. It is 100% plot. The characters are brilliant, and it really makes an impression. This is just a no nonsense, excellently written, good book."
"Negative","Not treat: OK dvd but not what I was expecting. There needs to be more instruction for people like me who are new to this type workout."
"Positive","Wagons West Series by Dana Fuller Ross: This is an excellent book as is any book by Dana Fuller Ross. I enjoy purchasing books through Amazon and go there first when searching for a book. Their vendors have always been honest and quick to deliver."
"Positive","AWESOME!!!!: ONE OF THE GREATEST DOLLY CDS EVER!!!!I THINK DOLLY OUT DID HERSELF WITH THIS CD!!! BUY IT!!! YOU WNT BE DISAPPIONTED!!!"
"Negative","kind of misleading: The amazon description was:leatherCasual fashion belt that moves with you and conforms to the waistExpands approximately 1"" without extra tabs or attachmentsPadded leather tabs and loopSatin silver finished buckleWear with jeans or sportswearThe first Item ""Leather"" is misleading, the belt actually states ""Genuine Leather with Bonded Lacing made in china""So the only real leather part is the portion on both ends that buckle together, the mesh or majority of this beltis in fact not real leather at all. That would probably explain other reviewers comments about longevity and stretching!Had I known it was primarily bonded I would have chosen something else."
"Positive","exactly right: i needed an all purpose mug for work and this fit the bill perfectly. good for tea or coffee or even soup - poured from a pot or heated in the microwave."
"Negative","Overpriced plastic: The set has a decent enough board that you have to put together, but the cards are difficult to shuffle or deal and the chips are very cheap-feeling. At least the instructions are quite adequate, but that's not why you're spending this much."
"Positive","I still think about it: ""Go Ask Alice"" is a powerful book about a real girl who lived in the sixties. It takes your breath away and really makes you think. At the begining of the book she talks about boy trouble and normal teenage problums, by the middle one of her entries are, ""Like I'm in Denver now. When I was high I just hitched hiked up here..."" ""I hope I can find the guys I came up with, I only have twenty dollars I stole from my dads pants."" You could never even look at drugs. You will never read a book that hits you as hard as this. Brilliantly written, it will make you laugh, wonder, and cry."
"Positive","Pleasure Trap Review: This book provided me with an excellent understanding of how the Western World fell into the patterns of eating that are causing our modern diseases (obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, etc.). It also explains how our taste buds can be changed to actually prefer the foods that our bodies are designed to eat to stay healthy(which I tested and found to be true). Armed with this knowledge, I have successfully cured my acid reflux and lost weight while eating foods that I now prefer over the burger and fries norm of the American diet."
"Positive","Fun CD!: Love Matthew on this CD. His characterization is great. Wished Walter Cronkites ""narrations"" weren't so bland; but musically, it a great recording."
"Negative","2025???: This DVD drops in 2025? Isn't a seventeen year preorder a bit long? Won't DVDs be collectors items by then? Well I guess if I survive the Rise of the Machines, the Clone Wars, the melting of the ice caps, and the Clinton2 presidency I can look forward to Nicotina."
"Negative","what is the deal: The book which is ostensibly about a murder and a murder trial obsessively wanders off in all directions. Any time a noun appears--IWW, Pinkerton, baseball, theatre, etc. the author spends 50-100 pages telling us about a new subject. we don't even get to the trial for nearly 500 pages and then the treatment is inadequate.Common Ground was an awe-inspiring work. I found this to be terribly disappointing."
"Negative","I Refuse!: After such a reputation in the Rap Game, Mobb is Riding Da DDDD...of all people 50. I never. I haven't heard the CD all I see is 50 and his camp all over the joint and I know I would rather not hear. After all of the work they have put in over past 10 years and all of the tight MC's that exist they have camp-out with G=Unit. I guess that one hot track f/50 from the Free Agents was enough to give them trust in his reputation. Well they are 1 on billboard so I guess it worked. I guess after Common road on Kanye's dddddddd which didn't actually work in his favor. And I don't care if you agree, it is what it is and I know it is garbage without even listening that is how SMART I AM! It is averaging 3 stars and for rap artist with such credibility that equals GARBAGE. HA HA! The OJAY'S ONCE MADE A SONG CALLED FOR THE LOVE OF M O N E Y! What a Waste!"
"Negative","Mascara: Received it quicly. I am not thrilled with this mascara. Doesn't really lengthen or thicken. Stays on ok. Would not reccomend. Purchased by my wife."
"Negative","Glitter Prizes Perhaps, but VERY Superficial, Movie-Script Writing: The first of a trilogy, which I found much more like a TV-Script than a serious novel: a plethora of characters, most superfically defined, and few that I could care for, or even remember on completing the book. Fortunately the succeeding volume is substantially better, making it worth the chore of homework here."
"Positive","Best rpg game ever: my opinion, da best rpg there ever was! great story line and supa dupa fly plot to go wit that! dis legend is totally planned out cuz it did take 3 years to make dis game. totally awesome. everybody should buy dis game right here. tight!!! Im not really an rpg gamer but dis totally made me more interested! I will never forget this game!"
"Negative","Yikes!: This movie accomplished one impossible mission, which was to ruin the franchise. It came across as if someone's vision of the movie was conflicted from the very start, because the movie itself was all over the place. Tom Cruise gave a lackluster performance as super spy Ethan Hunt, but his entire crew for this movie seemed inept. With the exception of Jeremy Renner as William Brandt who's performance was outstanding, the rest of the team appeared to be miscast in their roles. Michael Nyqvist, of the original Dragon Tatoo movies was also gave a very good performance as Kurt Hendricks.The story itself presented as a comedy of errors more than anything. Not even close to what I expected from the Mission Impossible movies. While diehard Cruise fans will probably enjoy it, I wouldn't recommend it."
"Positive","DVI to ADC adapter: This product works great. They are a little on the expensive side when converting to the ADC type but it is what it it.Thanks,"
"Positive","JIM'S FINAL 24 HOURS: THIS WAS ANOTHER GOOD PURCHASE I MADE. I REALLY LOVE HEARING OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS ABOUT HOW & WHY JIM DIED,ESPECIALLY COMING FROM THE PEOPLE THAT WERE CLOSE TO HIM."
"Positive","carpal tunnel in both hands: Using small potatoes, especially the red potatoes, cutting them in halfladies with a little patients, the out come is perfect with a little olive oil and sea salt enjoy."
"Positive","every step of the way...: Steve Walsh is definitely one of the keys to the success of Kansas, but his solo effort allows him to shine on his own. My favorite song on the CD is Every Step of the Way. The power of his vocals is great and in my opinion, makes him one of the great singers in rock."
"Negative","mad: This is nothing like the movie Buttwefly effect, I thought it would be a sequial or at least similar to the first movie. I was really disapointesd."
"Negative","short lived: I bought this vacuum about 8 months ago. I wanted something cheap and lightweight because I only have one area rug in my house and the rest is hardwoods that I sweep. It died on me today. It just makes a very sad blown motor noise. It only got used for about 5 minutes twice a week for 8 months. Very short lived."
"Positive","Perfect solution to ingrown hair: I received item on time and in perfect condition. I've had my exfoliator for over a month and still works great! I can go a week without exfoliating because it pulls hair to its root. Hair grows back slowly and thinner!! This exfoliator saves time and worry about ingrown hair. WAY better than plucking each hair or shaving every couple days."
"Positive","This CD is GREAT!!!: This new girl group is Irish, and uses Irish type of music in their songs. The songs have a beat, and is fun to listen to. I am advising everyone to buy this great CD."
"Positive","Does He or Doesn't He?: This is gambling fiction that's way out there on the cutting edge. (How do I know? I'm the editor of a gambling publishing company and I see it all.)God Doesn't Shoot Craps presents not only an outrageous treatment of gambling systems and theories, it also gets to the very heart of risk-taking, as it applies to philosophy, religion, and even life and death. The characters are worthy of Mario Puzo and Tom Robbins. The writing is insightful, humorous, and stylish (the secret behind New Jersey massage parlors is worth the price of the book).And the all-important plot? It's a rip-roaring page-flipping roller coaster ride from start to finish and the surprise ending answers the question -- with complete authority, no less -- as to whether God does or doesn't shoot craps."
"Negative","This is a book about Universalism not Christianity: I recommend reading John Caddock's review in Journal of the Grace Evangelical Society, Vol. 10, #19 before purchasing this book. According to Caddock, Manning places experientially based learning above scriptural truths instead of using God's Word as sideboards to understanding. Caddock labels Manning's ""contemplative spirituality"" as dangerous. I would tend to agree."
"Positive","Atomica: Fans of Bjork, Portishead, or any kind of music that's been described as ""downtempo"" will be in audio-heaven with this release. ""Metropolitan"" manages to sound somber without being depressing, intelligent without being pretentious, and relaxing without being boring and forgettable. While the programming and musicianship is top-notch throughout the entire album, Lauren Cheatham is truly the main attraction. Her soft, beautiful voice fits the tone and mood of the songs perfectly.I'm having a hard time putting to words how much I like this album, so I'll leave it at this: ""Metropolitan"" is nothing short of stunning. If this isn't the best album of 2005, it's definitely in the top five."
"Negative","Wish it lasted: I have this grinder for about a year. It worked great, but the tube u stuff meat through was a little small. I ground whole chikens for my cats, and it went ok til today. I put a leg through it and i heard a crunch and the shaft stopped turning. I opened thecasing up and the gears come to find out are plastic, so needless to say this is the weakest link. So other than the fact that it just broke on me it was an ok grinder for meat only!!!"
"Positive","Great Gigabit Router: This is a very nice gigabit router; I have Verizon DSL and had no issues setting it up. The wireless reception is great and I would recommend to anyone."
"Negative","underwhelmed: We were excited to purchase this product thinking it would look nice in our newly finished basement. The cheap-looking plastic is reminiscent of an infant tub. Painting it would not work well either since the texture is speckled. After having many guests give negative feedback, we decided it would be much better to put in a drywall niche. Also, note in the product description that ALL SALES ARE FINAL and NO RETURNS ALLOWED."
"Negative","WAY OVERPRICED!!: The pricing is absolutely ridiculous as a stand alone item. You can get quality hard drives with over 100 GB of memory for the same price. There isn't much you can do about it though since you'll need a hard drive to take advantage of the system's full functionalities and Microsoft knows this. They are using the margins they make off these hard drives to offset their costs incurred elsewhere."
"Positive","Fascinating, extremely well researched and written: This book surprised and delighted me. It is a well written story of the man and also of the whole history and background of the evangelical movement in that part of the world. I couldn't put it down, it was that good! Reads like a novel, only it's all true. I highly recommend this book."
"Positive","I owned this album in my youth.: I was a Cat Stevens fan 30 years ago( or more) This was a gift to my daughter who has recently discovered Cat Stevens and Dylan and others. She loved it."
"Negative","we didn't make through: My 4yo loves Cars but this one didn't make the cut. This is fine as there's too much violence for a G. Nobody can terrify your toddler like Disney w/the help of MPAA. I'm glad I used DVDExpress and I'm only out $1."
"Negative","Cuts out on me, too: I bought mine used. Never seemed very loud for the stated power. It started powering down with greater frequency until it became unusable."
"Positive","""You Either Like Hate Mail Or You Don't, And I Like It"": `Is It True What They Say About Ann?' is a low budget, but entertaining documentary film offering both the fans and foes of Ann Coulter an insightful look into the private person and public persona of one of the most controversial conservative political figures in America today.As many other reviews have already pointed out this is definitely not one of the most professionally made documentaries on the market. However Ann shines through the mediocre production values as only Ann could. Her razor sharp wit, biting comebacks and fearless rhetoric is on full display. Whether you agree with her viewpoint or not you have to admire her for being willing to face her most vehement critics head on with a smile and flair that has established her as an American icon. You either love her or hate her, but you certainly can't ignore her.Recommended viewing for those of all political persuasions."
"Negative","awful sound: the sound (or lack of it - couldn't hear very well) was terrible. People I was talking to thought I was calling from an echo chamber. I took it to a friend's house to be sure it wasn't my phone or my telephone line but it was still very poor quality. Returned within days."
"Positive","Another gift from my husband: Definitely European bakery, much more technical using european ways that most of us in the US are not very familiar with. Takes some getting used to! It does have some great recipies that take TIME to make."
"Negative","Horrible movie!: I really do not understand how so many people can give good reviews to such bad movies. I saw this in the theater and everyone was laughing, but it's not supposed to be funny. The criminals are such bumbling idiots that it makes it impossible for the movie to be suspenseful. The holes in the plot are HUGE! Has it been that long since anyone has seen a Hitchcock movie? You'd think that most directors would be familiar with his work, and would have a basic idea of how to create suspense. I've never been to film school but I guarantee you that I could make a better movie than this one."
"Positive","Reynaldo Lerma: I used this pan last night, it works very good, I only need to reduce my mix from ten to seven pineapples,The cake was excellent, with the piece, I had to dispose half as my wife and sister do not like two day old pineapple unside cake. We are very please I took two pictures but do not have add pictures available."
"Negative","clean up your act: tea purchase included an order of butter cookies which were shipped with an 8/24/12 exp date when shipped on 9/21/12 znd reeked of coffee even after opening the plastic seal. TWINGS TEA is always good but i would never order thru this particular comany again. have a nice day!!!!"
"Negative","No Sound in Video Mode AT ALL !!!!: One thing that bothers me the most with this camera... is that when in video mode, the video takes no sound!!! Similar models from Canon offer digital cameras that record sound; therefore, I cannot recommend this product at all."
"Positive","Good read: Enjoyed this book. Would have given it 5 stars but a few sections of the book were too drawn out. These scenes took 4 or 5 pages when 2 or 3 would have been great."
"Positive","Hit The Spot: This is a story about love, friendship, sex, rejection, getting older and knowing what you want in life.It is full of humor and some poignant moments too. Fans of Nick Hornby (like me) will love this book. Anyone who hasn't read anything by him before read this one first - you'll be hooked. (Suggestion for a perfect partner - Steve Horsfall (You Are Here), i.e. captures all of the above)"
"Negative","Watching Mold Grow Is More Fun: This movie makes me sick to my stomach. The villain isn't creepy or funny, even though he tries to be (the subway scene was just sick, NOT FUNNY!) And if they're aliens, how does the NO FIGHTING ON HOLY GROUND rule apply to them? It shoudln't. The alien thing just didn't work. There is one plus, though: the acting is so horrible that it's funny sometimes (just watch McLeod drive!)"
"Positive","Solid knife: Loved the knife the blade and handle construction is excellent. Was really happy with the blade size and shape. Will make a good utility knife. Bought one as a gift and got one for myself. I took off one star because of scratches on the handle. They came in a box wrapped in plastic but the handle made it appear used."
"Positive","Absolutely FRESH: If you heard Blu on Exile's ""Dirty Science"" cd you'll know to expect something great. I remember blasting that album in my car and every time I had to look at my Ipod to see who it was when his verse came on. When I saw he and Exile were releasing a joint I grabbed it like I was starving. The first track is bumping and the rest and just straight, well slower and very glamorous as far as beats are concerned, but the other tracks you really get into who Blu is and how he flows. This is a stand out cd that I'll covet until I need a hearing aid. The word is ""fresh"" people."
"Negative","Very adolescent writing and silly stories!: I found the writing to be very adolescent. The dialogue is so unrealistic and the stories. Please!! Emmett hates Melody and treats her like crap, then in the space of one afternoon wants to marry her and have a baby. Ted hates Coreen and treats her like crap, then in the space of one afternoon wants to marry her and have a baby. Anyone sensing a pattern here? Save your money and time folks, this is a big waste of both!!"
"Positive","Space by Andrew Chaikin: This is a coffee table size book with many spectacular photos from space and from other aspects of the Space Program. Andrew Chaikin has don his usual marvelous job with this book. It is even more than I expected and it was received in new condition on a timely basis. I intend to get all of Andrew Chaikin's books."
"Negative","BAD: Bad taste, Penthouuse quality, improve your image, not sure why you would wnat to order such a low quality magazine."
"Negative","Disappointing--avoid: This book tries to be fair and balanced, but it misses the mark. It's an obvious attempt by the author curry favor with Yoko Ono. Ono, ""a respected artist""? In what universe? Ultimately, this book serves as another attempt to protect the myth of ""The Ballad of John and Yoko."""
"Positive","First, Break All the Rules: This is a well-written motivator. It helps you value what your organization already possess, communicate with your audience at hand and learn how to create your own heroes."
"Negative","It is a book too feministic: There is a film, that has been produced from the book. AnaBelén is the main character. Please, remark how beautiful she is."
"Positive","a great payer with one small problem: After trying out several different brands I finally settled on Panasonic DVD-RP62S. This is a great player with all the features that you might possibly need and the performance is superb. I won't say any more than that as other reviewer have heaped enough praise on it already.BUT, guys, could you make the buttons on the remote any smaller?! I mean you need a microscope to see them! And I'm talking about the buttons that get used a lot, like STOP,PLAY,PAUSE etc. This just drove me so nuts that I was going to return the player. Thankfully, my TV remote has friendly large buttons and I'm using it to control most DVD playback functions.I've checked out some other Panasonic models and several of them have the same remote with the same tiny buttons. I just can't understand why it is done this way. None of the other DVD brands have this problem."
"Positive","Top-of-the-Line Shower Radio: The Sony ICF-S79V Weather Band Shower Radio is by far the best shower radio I have ever owned. It has superb clarity and reception. This all in one radio has a Digital Tunner, a TV signal feature, AM/FM, and a Weather Band Station. There is a clear LCD screen which displays the current time and station. I would recommend thsi radio to any consumer who is lokking for the perfect shower radio. I have owned several shower radios, and this product by Sony is by far the top of the class."
"Negative","Rather disappointing - Seagates own manuals are better: I was quite disappointed with this book. It may be OK for beginners who want something a bit more substantial than a Crystal For Dummies, but Seagate's own manuals give more extensive explanations and clearer examples. Fifteen pages on subreports as opposed to 6 1/2 in this book. Save your money for one of the forthcoming references."
"Negative","Tough to set up: It writes music perfectly, but for some reason I haven't been able to get it to write any sort of executeable file without the file being unreadable."
"Negative","Butterflies of Southeastern Arizona: I was very disappointed in the book, Butterflies of Southeastern Arizona, because the pictures of the butterflies are in black and White."
"Positive","A great work!: Edna Kramer gives such wonderful insight to mathematical evolution that she makes it come alive! To understand the struggles these math giants went through to solve problems that we now learn in a short time provides a real grasp of the solutions and how they came into being."
"Negative","This really sucks: What the hell is wrong with Warrant? This album is first of all missing Big Talk, Bed Of Roses, and Mr. Rainmaker, and second of all Heaven and Sometimes She Cries are each about 2 minutes long... where the hell are last halfs of the songs Jani? Don't ever by this album if you know what is good for you. Just by DRFSR and Cherry Pie, they are Warrants only good albums."
"Negative","Dead Ports: I got this in the afternoon. Plugged everything in and it worked. The next morning the USB ports had died. There was a faint odor of burning plastic, but I was reassured by a friend that is normal when you first use one of these. I was hoping for more instructions and a heads up on the odor would have been nice. I needed the ports so I give this a thumbs down."
"Negative","promises to be better than it is: How could a book so good end up as a movie so bad? It makes the appearance of being a classic, with it's star-studded cast and cinematography, but fails miserably. There's just nothing worth watching it for. Stick with The Black Stallion and Black Beauty."
"Negative","Wow some of the worst acting ever....boring: Where did they find these actors. What are people thinking to like this. This would have been better as a documentary so at least you could listen to Morgan Freeman's voice and expect bad acting. Give us another black hawk down.You have a better chance of committing suicide then to die in combat if your a soldier in the war on terror. That's a realistic war movie."
"Positive","A Wonderful Read- Funny, Realistic, Riveting, Honest: Have you ever read a book that your friends wanted to hear about? This is it. Whether it's describing the bat stretcher story, the friendships with Mattingly and Abbott, or the author's disastrous experiences with a pyramid scheme and 50 illegal CDs, you will have everyone's attention. It's funny, fast paced, honest, riveting, and realistic. I guess I should have known something was up when the woman in front of me bought seven copies."
"Positive","Brian Lumley any thing pertaining 2 him: I'm N love with anything he writes,wish he would make mini series movies 2 each book he writes ,love every gory detail.He needs 2 make them come alive. Thanks, I curl up with u every night."
"Negative","Interesting but...: I thought this book would be about how people form beliefs from a biological point of view.While I did like a lot of his non spiritual ideas, his criticism of darwin / darwinians is unfounded as darwin fully explained how important environment is in evolution if you actually read ""on the origin of species"", and darwin knew nothing of genes or DNA so why slam darwinian evolution ? because it doesn't need a creator or spiritualism."
"Negative","this codex need not be found: I got carried away at the bookstore one day and I ended up buying this book, since it looked like it could be promising. Ug, was I ever wrong. This sort of literary mystery fiction is hot these days, which I thoroughly enjoy, but this is just another one of those books trying to catch a free ride on the train.I did not find the plot to be intriguing nor in the slightest bit believable, instead, it seemed contrived to fit a tidey, neat little literary mystery package.Instead seek these codexes:Mathew Pearl's 'Dante Club'Carlos Ruiz Zafon's 'The Shadow in the Wind'Arturo Perez-Reverte's 'Club Dumas'Erik Larson's 'The Devil in the White City'"
"Negative","Constellation-al ain't sensational: Hoover S3345 Constellation Vacuum Cleaner works fine on wood floors. It does a good job with the small brush and crevice tools also. BUT, it is ineffective, virtually worthless, on carpet, I should have read Consumer Reports first. I am very disappointed with this product."
"Negative","Are you kidding?: Is the title trying to make us believe there are 100,000,000 people out there with musical taste that horrid? I seriously doubt it. This is the apex of banality. So many great bands deserve a box set and what are we getting these days? This and Nirvana. Jesus."
"Negative","FINGERS DON'T WORK: I HAVE USED IT FOR ONLY TWO WEEKS AND THE FINGERS SENSOR HEART RATE START TO SHOW A WRONG 240 HEART RATE EVERYTIME I TOUCH THE SENSORS, WITH THE STRAP IS WORKING PERFECT BUT THE TOUCH SENSOR IS VERY BAD."
"Negative","doesn't work.: My yogurt smelled like yogurt, but it was runny like milk. I followed the directions closely. Boiled my milk, wait for it to cool down, at the specified temperature I added the yogurt starter. I used the thermometer provided with the EuroCuisine yogurt making machine. Everything should have worked out fine, but it didn't. This yogurt starter just doesn't work.I have a lot of success using just plain yogurt from Walmart as my starter, and it's a lot cheaper too."
"Negative","travesty: This is horrible! Thay tried to make a sweet ballad singer into a disco queen. They even made Ave Maria into a rap song. All Seiko fans will surely be dissapointed. Although the 1st 6 tracks are sort of passable and track 2 is mildly catchy...after track #6...turn it off!!! Trust me."
"Negative","Edges are sharp.: These blocks were a good price, but the edges are sharp. Before our children will be able to play with them, WE WILL HAVE TO SAND EACH BLOCK. We will not purchase this again."
"Positive","great gift: purchased for a corporate gift.looks classy in an office.has good coloring.good shipping time.good pricing - have been shopping around for globe bookends."
"Negative","Thought this would be a good book: I was excited to see a book listing the Saints on a calendar basis. I opened the book to See at January 1st St. Basil was mentioned with a nice story. However, to my dismay, St. Haralambos, a saint that lived in the 2nd Century and one of the most popular Easter Orthodox Saints was not listed for Feb. 10th! Being that it was February 11th today when I checked the book, it was easy to see. I think this book needs to be expanded, or it should make clear that not all saints are mentioned in it."
"Negative","rear window (region 2): Didn't realize when I purchased this product that there were different regions for dvds. I asked the seller what the refund process was and how much the cost difference would be to get a region 1 dvd but did not get a response on that question. Not very happy with purchase. Will not purchase from this seller ever again unless I can get this remedied."
"Negative","Was fun but not a lot of fun: My kids played with this but not for long. Because these vehicles can't reverse or change speeds makes them rate pretty high on the ""get's bored fast"" meter. The idea of the toy is good but it really needs some extra user interface built into it."
"Positive","weebooma: My husband and I also attended this concert and had excellent seats as well. I can't say enough about the wonderful acoustics in this theatre, but most of all, these two living legends put on a show that was outstanding. I am so thrilled to be able to buy this DVD. If you are a fan, this is a must have. Enjoy!"
"Positive","Riveting book that was a nice read and thought-provoking: From the first pages, I found myself drawn into this fascinating history of the federal witness protection program. Some of the tales that WITSEC founder Gerald Shur can tell are amazing - as good as some of the better crime thrillers (proof yet again that fact is stranger than fiction). Some of the stories are terrible, too, but I really enjoyed the fact that the narration comes across in that ""just the facts, ma'am"" approach that doesn't attempt to skip or gloss over or put a spin on the mistakes and problems that came up. Overall, the book makes a powerful statement on why we have and why we need such a program."
"Positive","Good read, despite the elitest raving: I read this book in two days at work...I liked it very much, though I did find that it had many common elements of other fiction. What doesn't? Everyone should know, there is never anything that is original now! Everything is a copy and it can be easily argued...The people raving about how bad this book is are simply elitist. They have had favorites in the past and are acting like they are rouge scholars and this book isn't worth there VERY valuable time. They are full of it! I say...Congratulations kid; I look forward to reading on and finding out what happens to our young hero."
"Negative","Understanding What Your Order: I was happy to have found the book I had been seeking, and trusted, (a word that should never be utilized in net-purchases)it to be new or nearly so, as the price was just that. However when I received the book I found reader notes amuck.I seldom if ever destroy the sacred pages of a book, especially one by such a beloved author with mindless ramblings but others do it and that is fine for them but they should NEVER attempt their resale with-out notice. This book is useless to me!"
"Positive","Brilliant!!!: Wow, Maroon 5 is the grooviest and funkiest band on the planet. I would have never really guessed by some of the stuff I saw on MTV. And I'm actually surprised that they didn't really pitch them to an urban audience. This CD is almost more Funk/Jazz/R&B than Pop. This band could school the best of them. They know their instruments well, proficient beyond words. I just got this from the store yesterday and the cashier said she loved this album, and now I know why. They should have won Album of the Year at the Grammys. I would highly recommend this CD."
"Positive","great little tool: Very well made, all plastic, nothing really to break. Made dumplings and ravioli with it and they turned out fantastic."
"Positive","The Good Ol' Horror Flicks: Wow! This is a GREAT DVD! I've been a Sam Katzman fan since way back! The Giant Claw is classic everyone should own. When I was a little kid, these movies scared me to death. And my older brother didn't make it any better by scaring me even more. My brother recently came for a visit and he was surprised that I had this collection of horror movies. Sure they're funny to us now but as a kid . . . they were really scary. He did admit that the Zombies of Mora Tau scared him as a kid! Anyway it was fun to watch our old favorites together once again . . . as adults! If you love the classic horror flicks, this is one to own!"
"Negative","Mislabeled: Ordered 25 foot cables and I got the 6 foot version. Helps if you don't misrepresent the product since I read all of your descriptions."
"Negative","Wheels no longer move in front!!: The wheels on this stroller no longer roll, after very little use, maybe 10 times. They lock up and you have to pop-a-wheelie to move the stroller.I will NEVER by another Kolcraft. Wheel technology is hundreds of years old. This should not be happening in the 21st Century!"
"Positive","Uses archaeological data, material studies and archival research: LOST LABORERS IN COLONIAL CALIFORNIA: NATIVE AMERICANS AND THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF RANCHO PETALUMA uses archaeological data, material studies and archival research to examine how colonials controlled indigenous peoples and how Native Americans lived through and resisted these attempts. Chapters offer a strong blend of archaeological evidence and social history in a study recommended for any college strong in Native American studies or California history and anthropology."
"Negative","Incompatible parts: While the packaging for this stand was good, everything wrapped in plastic sleeves, the item would not assemble properly. In particular, the two horizontal braces that fit between the two front legs do not align with the bolt holes on the legs. It was so far off, I couldn't even force it. It was almost as if the parts came from two different stands! Made in China..."
"Positive","Seattle needs more downtempo!: If you want to experience the lounge/downtempo side of Seattle, buy this CD. Of course my boyfriend is on it and he will be coming out with a cd soon. He will also be featured in Mary Lydia Ryan's new CD as well. Song #15, Sugarless, Stefan Mendez...yes, his name is spelled wrong."
"Positive","great reading: This is one of those books I've had for a while and every once in a while I take out and read again. It's definitely a keeper -- written very well."
"Negative","Broken within 2 days of walking: These leashes broke within 2 days of walking my labs which are only 80 lbs. I would not recommend this item if your dogs pull at all on a walk."
"Positive","A Grand Gripping Tale of ""Uplift,"" Treachery, and Heroism: Readable -- perhaps compulsively so -- tale of a far future when all-too-human motives appear in ""uplifted"" dolphins and apes (who, with suitable vast volumes of water for the dolphins and their ilk, serve with human beings aboard starships). A slam-bang ending. Concepts to ponder (but when did SciFi lack CONCEPTS?) and characters -- especially the ""uplifted"" species -- rendered with a rare degree of density and fascination. Brin's best. Does NOT need the rest of the Uplift Trilogy (and may fare better in the reader's memory WITHOUT it)"
"Positive","Definitley worth a read: Another classic that is definitely worth a read. Its one of those books that is slow in a couple of places but the suspense of the ending - or the expected ending keeps you reading. Oh you just want to go back in time and find your own Captain Wentworth!!"
"Negative","HORRIBLE: IT FELL OFF THE DOOR AND HIT ME IN THE NOSE CAUSING ME TO GET 4 stitches!I will be returning it!"
"Negative","Overrated and superficial: The satire is weak, phony, and superficial, and the targets are easy. The book has nothing new to say."
"Positive","Great for beginner recyclers!: This item works great for minimal recycling. It is a good sturdy product that allowed me to start recycling. Each bin does not hold a large amount. Good to use if you take off the recycling frequently."
"Positive","Buttons Galore! Great Customer Service!: I was very impressed with this company and the product I received. The button bucket had a large assortment of different colored buttons and various sizes and shapes. I will be using these for scrapbooking. As for the company, they were quick in getting the buttons to me. I ordered on March 1 and received them on March 5. I did NOT pay for faster shipping. I also found them to be very responsive because Amazon showed my delivery could arrive as late as March 23 and I was concerned about that and sent an e-mail asking about this and received a response within 2 hours from the company reassuring me that I should expect my buttons that day. Very impressive customer service."
"Positive","remix: I like the CD. I found a real interesting way to be a part of Moby's music by mixing your own version of body rock at beatnik.com."
"Positive","Ann Rule has done it again.: In her recent book, ...AND NEVER LET HER GO, she has chronicled the background and actions of attorney Tom Capano's narcissistic need to control the lives of an entire community, members of his family and especially the lives of the women who loved and trusted him. The murder of his long-time mistress, who wanted to break away from him, led him to betray all those who loved, trusted and respected him. Rule's in-depth account of this tragic episode and her detailed accounts of the subsequent investigation, arrest and trial vividly illustrate how Tom Capano's actions united the family of his victim. While at the same time, his lies, deceit, and duplicity turned his brothers against him and each other completely dividing his own family. ...AND NEVER LET HER GO is a story that all women and some men can identify with, and is yet another Ann Rule writing triumph to be read and enjoyed by her numerous fans."
"Positive","Not her best...: This is an ok cd but not my favorite from Madonna.The title trackand Material Girl are the best on this cd. If you like those songs get The Immaculate Collection, it has both of those songs plus her other hits."
"Positive","Very Good Garlic Press: This Oxo Stainless Steel Garlic Press can crush couple cloves of garlic, peeled or unpeeled, in one shot. It's very easy to use and to clean. However, as one reviewer had pointed out earlier, the rubber cover of the handles trap water. But there is no need to strip the rubber; just let the garlic press drip dry. It's a very good garlic press so far."
"Positive","Compact & Durable: I received my first of these flashlights as a gift. After it was stolen out of my truck, I bought two more. It is compact and durable. The xenon light is very bright and the LEDs provide a good close distance flood light. The best features are the compactness and light options. The negative aspects are the special battery requirements and the weight. I still like this flashlight better than the MAGlite."
"Positive","Great book for preschoolers!!!: I'm so glad that I finally found a devotional book that is age appropriate for my daughter. She looks forward to listening to and answering questions about each devotional every day. I love that each is accompanied with a daily scripture and prayer as well. Great purchase!"
"Positive","Book of All Knowlege: This is the ultimate guide to all things MAN. It is the I-Ching of Manliness. My self (a Man)and my friends (also Men) refer to this tome of greatest wisdom and ""The Book of All Knowledge"". We put on on our wingtips, crank up the Chevy Straight 8, and and say ""To hell with the enivornment, its full speed ahead"""
"Positive","Great product with a couple of irritating aspects: I've had my Zen Touch for about two weeks now, and I love it! I'm a poor college student so the price worked for me, and I've had absolutely no problems with it. Two little irritating things though:The touchpad is super sensitive, even on the lowest setting it's still really easy to scroll over what you're looking more. But with a little practice it get easier.The software truly is crap, which is why I only gave four stars instead of five. If you're going to transfer music I would just use Windows Media Player. It's super simple and most people already know how to use it."
"Negative","Set Your Goals - Reset: I did not receive the album I ordered. I waited almost a week and a half and I had to return the album they sent me because it was not the right purchase."
"Positive","Great little bag: I got this bag for a Pentax Optio S6, and it nicely fits the camera, a spare battery and a spare SD card. The bag is a slight bit more bulky than I'd like but still pretty small and protects the camera well. The velcro belt buckle is a nice feature.The only drawback: The camera wrist strap catches on the bag's velcro closure and gets frayed badly. I got a silicone wrist strap that avoids the problem."
"Negative","Grill top very bad quality: Being Swiss, I know how what normal wear and tear is on a racelette oven. The oven itself is great, and the little pans are made of good non stick material. The top grill however is of very very poor quality. The coating was starting to chip, in addition to bubbles forming on the surface just after a couple of uses. I do NOT recommend this grill if you want to be grilling on top."
"Positive","Great investment: We've been using this for over a year. The coffee tastes great, and we never have to run to the store because we've run out of paper filters. Very durable. And very green! Tell your friends, and save a tree!"
"Positive","Fun speeders = Fun product: Love the speedminton set. The fun birdies offer a more medium speed as opposed to the match birdies (which offer more height and fly faster) Purchased extras since the basic speedminton set only came with 1 of each type of birdie style: fun, match and night. Fun birdies are also better suited for playing with kids."
"Negative","saggy bottom: I bought this item because of all the good reviews, now I wondering if I should trust any of the amazon reviews anymore...It is so obvious that the bassinet bottom was made of 3 pieces, very saggy like a piece of crap... Where baby sleeps has to be hard and flat,that is the only thing important for a bassinet."
"Positive","Great Fun-till it locks up: My 8 year old son bought this and really enjoyed playing it, but now the game is at a standoff with him. He had 39 cards in his deck, then when he added one more, it said he ""exceeded"" the limit and would not let him duel...he gets rid of 1 card, then it tells him he only has 39 and still can't duel. He is really frustrated by this and has not been able to find the problem..."
"Positive","Good movie: I still love it after all these yearsI still love it after all these yearsI still love it after all these yearsI still love it after all these years"
"Positive","Not How I Remembered...: When I found this DVD I jumped at the chance to own it and watch it with my children. I remembered watching it with my siblings when we were young and I love movies that bring back memories. Well, this one surprised me because I did NOT remember the dark side of the movie. (Abandoning your children and witches baking up little children for pies.) I guess I must have blocked out the actual story and was just thinking of movie times with my siblings when we were young. I am still very happy with the DVD and the happy memories that it brought for me. But I would suggest viewing or re-viewing this movie before showing it to your little ones. lol"
"Negative","Review is right- it is like the Swiftboat book!: The Amazon review says :""But just as the swift boat veterans convinced millions of voters that John Kerry lacked the character to be president, Klein's book will influence everyone who is sizing up the character of Hillary Clinton.""That is right. A book filled with lies hoping to change elections. This book is a disgrace to Penguin Publishing."
"Negative","car seat made cheap: Hadn't been set up one day, when one of the black plastic hooks broke. My dog only weighs 6 pounds, so thought it would be fine, but very cheap and flimsy. The problem with buying through the mail is it cost too much to return."
"Negative","Wouldn't buy this type again: I had purchased the Perky Pet Hummingbird Feeder on a different occasion and thought I would get another as the Perky Pet window mounted was such an attraction for hummingbirds. Unfortunately, the Opus model did not adhere to the window very well (and yes we did try using hot water on the suction cups.) I recommend getting the Perky Pet to those who want a no fuss feeder."
"Negative","Resist the temptation...it doesn't deliver.: For those of us who harbor secret fantasies about noncompliance, the title of this movie was almost impossible to resist, especially after all the controversy it inspired. It did not live up to what I was expecting at all...I lost interest long before it was over, and it is not a lengthy film. I was not expecting great art or great cultural value, but I was expecting more emotion, more reality in the action and the dialogue. It has plenty of graphic sex, but any porn flick offers that. If you are looking for something wildly different and shocking with at least a little eroticism, look elsewhere; Baise-Moi doesn't come through."
"Positive","Inexpensive: Very affordable, easy to set up. Keep in mind you will need an electrical outlet. Despite it has a filter the water gets dirty so you will have to give it a weekly maintenance. Fits in my small kitchen and my kitten loves it!"
"Negative","Yoga and weights do not mix: Having been both a yogi and weight lifter for half a dozen years, I had hoped this book would offer a program to efficiently combine the two practices to save time. In actual practice, combining them results in the decline in quality of both activities. They should be done separately where proper focus can be given to the form and intensity of each practice. Not recommended."
"Negative","Commodores CD could have been better: For anyone who is a genuine lover and fan of the Commodores, this CD would be a great asset, however, too many tracks on one disc is too hard to believe and as it goes, this equals some of the tracks being shortened or edited to the single versions instead of the full-length versions due to the amount of tracks and time. This always happens. The songs you love the most are single edits. Therfore, this CD becomes a waste to buy because you would rather have songs like these at their fullest to enjoy better. It's really to bad no one has put out The Commodores in a box set of three to four discs. It would cost a lot but all the songs for Commodores lovers would be the long versions."
"Positive","Garden stand: I received the item faster than expected! Good quality for the money!Compliments to the seller for fast service!"
"Negative","to small for one: This is more of a kids tent.... I'm about 6ft and was to tall for it! Defiantly can't fit two... gave it to my brothers kids"
"Positive","Self Help? Help YOURSELF!: Some people just don't get that books like _Men are from Mars_ AREN'T for everyone. It even SAYS so in the introduction to the book! However, for those people that can glean information from a chapter without thinking that everything MUST apply to them, this is a must-read. I'd recommend going to the library and skimming first, then purchasing for a deeper read. Not everything in this book applied to my girlfriend and I, but enough did to help our relationship GROW beyond what I ever expected."
"Positive","Absolutly Fantastic!: With Various artists like Jane Wyman, Ginny Simms, and many others Cole Porters timeless music is carried on. From the 1946 biographical movie, Cole Porter's best music is in there, and now on the soundtrack. The most famous songs like ""Just one of Those Things"", ""Night and Day"", and ""What is this Thing Called Love"" are in this movie soundtrack. Wonderful voices with wonderful songs can't go wrong!"
"Positive","Very satisified: Ordered this for a 2000 Chrysler Grand Voyager. The item shipped/arrived quickly and was packed well. The side mirror fit perfectley and works just as good as the old side mirror. I would recommend this part if your replacing a damaged side mirror."
"Positive","great value: I bought a LT27HVX in late November. I was very surprised by the performance for this value line LDC TV. A shortcoming of other lower price and older LCD's is black level and smearing of motion images. This TV in my opinion is excellent. Has a DVI input, included is a DVI cable. Documentation is fine. Easy to set up, overall picture quality is great. Used the component inputs with my Pscan DVD player and was very impressed.Cons: Styling is plain, speaker quality is disappointing, but then again many may connect it to a home theater system, remote is very basic.Overall a great value TV, shop around as prices do vary."
"Negative","I'd prefer a refund: This book is a great disappointment. Imagine reading an updated version of Dale Carnegie's ""How to win friends and influence People"". How could the publisher be so stupid? I have ordered the 4th edition but want a refund on the 5th edition."
"Positive","good size but difficult data entry: Everyone knows the Pilot is a wonderful take-along source for retrieving data. For a one-way device it's fine. The ""graffiti"" handwriting recognition takes some getting used to, and most difficult for left handers. Almost impossible to take notes in a meeting because it's so slow. Data entry is best done from your PC/Mac, not from it's screen. You owe it to yourself to check out the Psion Series 5."
"Negative","Only Partially Convinced: I'm some what dissapointed that the author states his doubts and unbelief that God speaks to His children personally. I know He does for He speaks to me and to many other believers i know. I found other parts of the book useful like when the author showed that the Message should be clearly communicated to unbelievers without ignoring parts of the truth."
"Positive","Great follow up to first Alabama christmas album: Our family is a big fan of the first Alabama christmas album and this one didn't disappoint. WE'll be enjoying this for many Christmases to come."
"Negative","Annoying: There is one aspect of this book that I found REALLY annoying which let down my reading experience.I found myself searching through my dictionary almost as often as I blinked. James, congratulations you have a great vocabulary *puke*"
"Negative","Not what I was looking for: Looks really hip and cool, with the blue enamel and steel. It's actually very cute, and tough. However, The capacity's pretty small. I'm trying to think of someone to give it to, who lives in say a studio apartment, with small-capacity sinks, and I think it'd be a perfect fit."
"Positive","Panamax. Serious people, giving you serious performance...: I bought a Panamax MAX100 a bunch of years ago, to protect my stereo. Things break, and that is what my surge protector did. I didn't have a receipt,and it was a long time since I purchased it. I called Panamax to see if they could repair it (with me paying for it).They told me that it was in waranty, to send it, and that they would fix it.I sent it, and they sent me a brand new one back at the turn of the mail. They have a customer for life.This new one that I bought is great, and I was lucky to get it at a wonderfull price."
"Positive","It's been done, don't you people read comics?: This is without doubt an outstanding, breathtaking movie. But I don't understand why no one mentions 'Magnus, Robot Fighter'. Humans, being used as batteries by intellegent robots, dates back to the 1960's. And revisited again, in a new way, decades later...again in 'Magnus, Robot Fighter'. I'm not putting the movies down, but the concept isn't as original as most imply. I would find it VERY difficult to believe that the comics did NOT inspire the movies to some degree. But I endorse BOTH. Please, read the comic. The brief older storyline, and the much longer one decades later. It's ALL good, just different twists on the same topic."
"Negative","News flash to Chabon: Michael--Why do you think that the Jews in Alaska would speak Yiddish? A substantial number of Jews are from Arab countries and speak Arabic. Typical Ashkenazi ethnocentrism. I wasn't crazy about Cavalier and Clay and this is worse. I give up."
"Negative","allergic reaction: I usually don't have a problem wearing sterling silver but cannot wear cheap earrings that are just of any metal. They have to be sterling , gold, or made for sensitive ears. These say sterling but still caused an allergic eraction within just a couple of hours of wearing. The retailer, however, did not have a problem e mailing me a free shipping label for return."
"Positive","A great book about Truman: This is an excellent book. David McCullough is one of the best historians . His books are always goodI highly recommend this book"
"Positive","Heavy rotation!: I made out like a bandit with this cd. Until recently, the label and the dj (Mauricio Aviles) were unknown to me. However, any cd featuring 'Atjazz' in the lineup has got to flow. If you like deep, smooth house then you will relate to this mix! It is mellow but the beats are strong. The remix version of MJ Cole's 'Sincere' is as wicked as they come! It is always nice to have a good source of deep house mixes. I trust that the Nude Dimension series won't disappoint the masses!**Watson**"
"Positive","Maxwell Street, as it was when I worked there: I enjoyed reading this. It brought back places and times that no longer exist. I loved working there on weekends with my father and uncle. I even found my father's picture in it."
"Positive","Good movie worth the buy: I saw training day in the theaters the week of release, and loved it.It had s decent amount of action and denzel played a very good part, your never really sure if hes good or bad until the end.Im glad i saw it BEFORE he won his award, because if i did what almost all the people badmouthing this movie did and expect WONDERFUL acting and look and pry at the movie for plot holes i would never have enjoyed it.sure theres things that where not needed or things that didnt quite make sense but who cares, the story was good the movie was fun thats all that matters.Falling prey to any kind of hype can kill a movie experiance.Look at episode I, everyone expected THE BEST and when it wasnt the greatest thing they had ever seen...well the were dissapointed.Leave expectations of a Brilliant performance at the door and expect a courrupt police movie with good acting,action,and story and you will enjoy this movie."
"Positive","Good value: Currently it's better pricing than you'll find at Sam's. The tooth brush heads are LARGE. I was suprised. I'm used the regular heads and thought ""why not?"" when I saw these available. Well I won't be buying them again because they are too large for my mouth, though the quality is just fine."
"Positive","A Must Have for Literacy Instruction: Excellent resource for those teachers wanting to grow in their literacy instruction. If you feel like you have to reenergize your reading and writing program then this is a great book for you. I wish I had this book when I was a first year and would reccomend it for any teachers just starting out."
"Positive","movie: This is one of the best movies Ive seen even though its a foreign filmbut the guy (Amitabh Bachan) is my childhood hero would order more in the future"
"Negative","Crushed: The first time I received the wrong product completely & had to return it while I waited for the eyeshadow that I ordered. Once received, the eyeshadow was completely crushed, meaning the powder wasn't solid, it was crushed powder and fell out everywhere when opened."
"Negative","Item returned: After using Norelco rotary shavers for many years I decided to try this Remington, based on a review by Consumer Reports.Frequent nicks and constant irritated skin over a three week period made me decide this shaver was not meant for me. I am again back to my Norelco."
"Negative","P.O.S. PLEASE READ!!: This changer is the biggest piece of junk I have ever bought it didn't work the first time I used it and it took a knife to pry my battery back out if it. I even tried modding the little P.O.S. and it still did not work. Buy the official Sony changer and you will be much better off. GARBAGE DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!"
"Positive","Sock 1 learning to knit socks with two circular needles: This video has very clear video instructions to follow along and takes you step by step with stopping points for you to follow the directions until you come to the next point. It makes sock knitting very easy with no confusion. I highly recommend this video. If you are interested in sock knitting this is a much easier technique to learn than using 4 pointed needles."
"Positive","Welcome to Hip-Hop 101: class is now in session!!!: This album should be a REQUIRED PURCHASE to show the world how hip-hop should be done: easy on the profanity, heavy on the bass and almost deeper than Malcolm X (almost!!!) ""Excursions,"" ""Verses.."", and ""Vibes.."" spotlight Q-Tip's tight, nasal flow, while Phife flips it on ""Butter"" like no tomorrow. Tribe should get retroactive Grammys for this one. A rap classic for the ages!!!"
"Negative","wanted to like it: The edition I read had great cover art and the premise looked really interesting. However, I found it really hard to get through the book. It was just plain badly written. I read it several years ago and I don't recall examples of what I disliked about it. I finished the book because I had nothing else around to read at the time. Bad enough that I've never had any interest in reading other Mongo books."
"Positive","Where's the Camera?????: This is a great kit for a little girl, would be much better if it was as advertised. Once again I order a gift for a little one, and the write up is incorrect! Write up states ...""1 beginner camera"".... There is no camera in the kit. This is the second time this has happened (in as many orders) to me. I am about through with Amazon.com. You have quick delivery, and a good selection, however, when there is false advertising about an item, one begins to wonder.!!!"
"Negative","More of the Same: Having read the original ""Albany Trilogy,"" I knew what to expect from William Kennedy. ""Ironweed"" was by far the best. Roscoe is number seven in what has moved from a trilogy to a ""series."" For me the series has gotten old. More of the same characters, strange relationships, and unique writing. If you like Kennedy's writing style and other books, there is no reason you would not like this one. I, however, found this one to be a tired retread of the same formulae Kennedy used in his earlier works.In Roscoe, the main character is another Albany pol who skirts the line between illegality and legality while fostering the political machine's criminal element. The character is not very believable and certainly not sympathetic. His relationships are even less believable.I should have stopped with Ironweed. I will not go back to numbers four through six of the series."
"Positive","Good product - but be prepared to handle a heavy mouse!: I trust Logitech for PC accessories like mouse, webcams and speakers. This one was a good product too. I bought this in 2004 and it is still working fine. The only disappointment I had was the weight of the mouse - when you insert 2 AA batteries into them, they become so heavy (especially if you are used to the lightweight USB corded optical mouses). So I stopped using the mouse and have been using just the keyboard.The customization keys (for yahoo/hotmail and other websites) haven't been of big help - may be the instructions weren't too user-friendly. So I ended up ignoring this feature.Very smooth to handle - not much noise while typing. I would recommend this product for those who don't care about the weight of the mouse - this is probably the best deal for you folks! And the price of this (~$30) hasn't changed for 2 years now!!"
"Positive","great: been looking for this cd for years since my cassette was destoryedin a house fire. it sounds just as great as it did when it firstcame out. thanks!!!!!"
"Positive","Outrageous colors: This duvet is bright yellow, which is not normally something I would buy, but it has held up extremely well and does the job of keeping my down comforter clean."
"Positive","Practical but not Preachy: Underdog Advertising is a clever, practical book on how to get your message across when your budget is limited but your thinking isn't. The author's writing style is a simple ""just the facts"" approach but loaded with good examples of successful ad campaigns and a fresh approach on why they worked. The book shows how to make strategy an underdog's best friend!"
"Negative","Not For Me: This book is not for me.I can't get past the pompous style. It reads like W C Fields except that it's not funny.Try this totally representative sentence from the chapter on Venus:""These collisions eject copious debris, yet all the rubble hugs close around the crater margins in neat festoons, as though contained there by the heavy air.""Festoons? Is this a joke? I can't help reading it in a W C Fields voice.For the chapter on Uranus and Neptune the author ""assumed Maria Mitchell wrote of her 1847 find to ... Caroline Herschel.(1750 - 1848)."" I can hardly tell the difference between the 19th century style and the rest of the book.The chapter on Mars written from the point of view of a Martian rock doesn't work for me.- - -I like the book ""Understanding the Planetary Myths"" by Lisa Tenzin-Dolma ISBN 0-572-03032-0"
"Positive","Fast-paced Fun--thrilling: ""Fast-paced fun and full of interesting insights into the darker side of American Politics. Shines a light on the difficult role of political women and the manipulation of the press.""--Susan, Livermore"
"Positive","His best book till this date.: Bag of bones is Stephens best book. It showes the reader that the master of the macabre can write as well as any one else not just horrer stories with tons of blood pouring out of the pages."
"Positive","Works fine: I bought this for my fiance's 2005 cavalier because the old strap she had on her muffler rusted off and I just put this on it and bolted it in. Works fine."
"Negative","A bit self indulgent for my taste: I thought this was probably a pretty satisfying experience for the brilliant Yo Yo Ma, but it left me pretty disappointed. I was expecting more of a cello-centered experience than was delivered.I found the dynamics maddening...some of the passeges too soft to be heard, other moments too loud to be enjoyed; I couldn't find a happy medium.I think this was essentially an exercise in self indulgence."
"Positive","Mom's Happy = I'm Happy: When my mom cooked for us while we were growing up, she used Magnalite pots. That's one of my sensory memories: Mom tapping the spoon on the side after stirring something, making a deeply satisfying DONG sound (uhhhh, the pot, not Mom). She lost all her Magnalite pots in Hurricane Katrina, so when my parents bought a new home, my siblings and I got my Mom the whole Magnalite set and this pot to set her straight again. She was ecstatic to have something familiar again, and she's still as happy nearly two years later. OK, she's not constantly as happy. Sometimes she gets mad at my dad when he feeds the dog jelly beans. But still. Totally worth it."
"Positive","HAVEN.T RECEIVED YET: OTHER MAGS I ORDERED AT THE SAME TIME CAME--WHERE,S THIS ONE ? DIFFERENT PUBLISHING COMPANY--WON,T USE THIS ONE AGAIN !!"
"Negative","ok album: this album is real good my favorite songs arefreethrough with loveother then that the album is ok i love destiny child i have all of there albums but seriously the best album they ever made was [writtings on the wall] hands down i dont care what no body say"
"Negative","disappointed: Waste of money. I didn't even watch it all. I guess I thought it was going to be a little more like a thriller or something or at least a little more real. But, instead it was cheesy and not even ""good"" cheesey.... more like store brand cheesey."
"Positive","Woody the Man!!: My son who is 7 yrs. old, is in love with Toy Story. We own all three movies. This doll is his little buddy and for his age, I was surprised to see him so attached to it. The doll is well made. I believe it will last a long time."
"Negative","Nice idea, poor execution...: As a part-time rehabber, having an all-in-one bathroom lighting and accessories solution is a dream come true. Unfortunately, while this set looks good, the actual product is very flimsy and cheap feeling. This is especially true of the toilet paper holder, towel bar and towel hook. Everything is very, very thin and easily bent/damaged. (Not to mention that the paper holder is just, well, weird.) My reccomendation would be to look for something with a little more heft."
"Negative","DON""T BUY THIS BOTTLE: I bought this as a perfume bottle for myself. It was such an ugly piece of junk when I got it. It looked like something I would have got at the dollar store. The glass was very poor and flawed. The etching on it was very poor as well. I was so disapointed."
"Positive","The Only Wize God: The book was in neat order and very well presented in form, readability and in packaging. I throughly enjoyed the examples and truth that was discussed by Mr. Craig. Thank you for having this book available so I can have a greater understanding of God and how I fit in His plan and in all His creatation."
"Negative","Fatal Mambo is not so fatal: Other reviewers claim Fatal Mambo made their feet move, but I'd say that may be because of the rhythms themselves and not the band. Fatal Mambo is made up of fine musicians who understand Afro-Cuban music well (among other rhythms), but they lack the tightness, the power, the magic one can hear in well known bands such as Eddie Palmieri, Tito Puente, Larry Harlow, and so forth. A acouple of tracks (Salsaioli & Tu Le Sais) reminded me of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, but again fell short in tightness, power, and magic. I was disappointed the band did not credit the composers of some of the well pieces they reinterpreted. Overall, this CD is interesting from the listening point, but very weak from the dancer's perspective."
"Negative","this movie moved at a glacier's pace!!!: can i get some subtitles? damn! people need to enunciate! and what abt the gratuitous nude seen by jessica chastain? predicable!! it took all my strength to watch this movie til the end. what is seen cannot be unseen. lawd hav mercy."
"Negative","Very Disappointed: I purchased this book with hopes of finding some information in teaching my ADHD son. I have been homeschooling for 3 years now and their ""start-up"" advice, although useful for others, was of no help to me. Most other books that deal with ADD/ADHD focus on children in the public school setting. I set out to find a book specifically dealing with homeschool children. This book is very deceiving in its title and I am saddened that the author would use ADD as a lure to get people to buy her book. Especially homeschoolers, who are often on a very limited budget to begin with. It should be titled, ""How to start homeschooling a child with special needs,"" and leave the ADD out of it. There are some very useful ideas for beginning homeschoolers, but if you are looking for ""specific"" guidance regarding ADD issues you will be very disappointed."
"Positive","Great Value for the Price: I purchased this computer for under $500 in the summer to replace a $1100 Dell. I love it and can't believe it was so cheap! I keep waiting for something to wrong but so far, I've been pleasantly surprised. I highly recommend it.:)"
"Negative","Subliminal messages: I was disturbed by this movie's use of Arabic music as the leitmotif for the pornography underworld. The story and setting had no other connection to Arabs or Arab countries, and the music had no purpose other than to cue the audience that something sinister was coming up. I found this association both offensive and alarming, particularly at a time when Arabs are targets of the American backlash against terrorism. Shame on Joel Schumacher."
"Negative","The Fingerprints of the Garbage (from Mars): Science is great. Except for one thing. It's too hard. The public won't buy it. But if you are a bit more motivated, go to any fine portal site and enter the keyword ""Fingerprints of the Gods"". You will find hundreds of very well-grounded criticisms.FYI, they published its Korean translation in two volumes. Somebody would have to doubly waste his/her money."
"Negative","One shot deal (hopefully): On one hand beautiful scenery and Stapleton's (et al) acting make this film bearable. On the other hand, the story is basically a modernized mishmash of past movies and offers very little originality to the viewer. If you know people involved or have absolutely nothing better to do then this film will help pass time. Otherwise you'll find much better and original both in the theater and on DVD release.Philip Chidel obviously learned something about directing before making this film (hence the two stars), let's hope that he can do the same with his writing before his next attempt. And please, please spare us a mishmashed sequel!"
"Positive","surprisingly good: Not a George Clooney fan but I loved this movie very much. I went to the movie with my other 3 female friends and the movie was the choice out of the four of us. I had never heard of it before and was prepared for a big disappointment. Just the opposite. It was a surprisingly fascinating film. Out of all of my friends, I believe I was the only one who understood what was going on throughout the film and simply liked the movie for the plot and actions, not because I adored watching the famous actor prancing around. It's a well directed and acted movie similar to those Rainmaker type films that leave you with a good feeling about obeying life's boundaries because of the reality ""what comes around goes around."""
"Negative","A Vengeful Deception -- An Appropriate Title: Never have I had such strong feelings toward a Harlequin romance before. When I finished this book I was so angry I threw it across the room. The premise was great. The characters were well developed and I like Lee Wilkinson's writing style, but the ending was atrocious. Gideon, our leading man, systematically destroys Anna's life. He is seeking revenge for her past crimes. Naturally it's a case of mistaken identity, but when Anna finds out what he has done she all too easily falls back into Gideon's arms. I have a hard time believing Anna, or ANY woman for that matter, would fall back into a mans arms so easily after he has ruined her life. Ms. Wilkinson should have written a few more chapters and really made Gideon work to win Anna back."
"Negative","It's awful...: The only relatively nice thing about this is that it can be fully disassembled. That's about it. Obviously it's not scale, as it advertises, but it's more like 2/3 than 3/4... The folding stock swings out with little effort... it can't be locked into place when in the folded position. The laser dot sight is incredibly flimsy. It's not worth it, even as a prop."
"Negative","BOOO: I did not like this product it wouldn't load on any computer I tried it on. They were all new computers of mine and my friends. So I give this asl teaching cds 1 star because I can't go any lower"
"Negative","5 pages of information hidden in an entire book: Jon Gindick trys to teach playing the blues in way that is entertaining and non-intimidating. But in the end the message is lost in a sea of meaningless chatter and storytelling. There are some good pieces of information in the book but they are difficult to root out."
"Negative","What a let down: Over at chameleon's blog the long-standing UK Appreciation Society said of this release..""When it comes down to the `sound' of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons it seems that fans have been done a disservice over the years. The recent Box Set issue of Jersey Beat was a missed opportunity and the muddy mono mixes and disappointing 60s stereo mixes leaves this groups `definitive', sound quality compilation a distant dream.""This is a great package and notes but terrible mastering. A disgrace really as others have commented. When will someone invest in properly re-mastering these classic recordings?"
"Negative","This was stupid: This is the dumbest movie ever. The special effects were ok, but that didn't help it. The script is stupid, the characters are stupid, and the ship design is stupid (Why are they using bullets?). The movie ends and you think that there should be at least another 10 minutes. This movie should be avoided like The Plague."
"Positive","I'd Ask To Be Buried With Them: These boots are comfortable and durable -- ride to work, drop by the promenade, walk around a bit. Excellent product!"
"Negative","not that great: the paint just was not as good as i hoped it would be. if you get this paint marker set you will need Enamel."
"Positive","Spiral slicer: I am very pleased with the performance of this product. It is as promised. The first recipe I made was zucchini spaghetti with a fresh tomato, basil, garlic, parsley sauce. I loved it and so did my husband (who is a real meat and potatoes guy)!"
"Positive","Excellent story for people to relate to!: In having read this book, I can only say that I was touched deeply by Julia's fight to gain her life after going through horrible life events. She tells a great tale and she has some great tips for those of us who desire to lose weight. So, thank you for a heartwarmer, Julia. This is a good addition to any library."
"Negative","Trite, Inaccurate and Mildly Annoying.: This book reads like a 16 year old girl's diary. The author begins by writing about, in excruciating detail, her divorce and then subsequent breakup with a man she dated shortly after divorcing her husband. Anyone who has been or known a teenage girl needn't read that portion of the book. The rest of the book flits between interesting insights into life, trite commentary and inaccurate anecdotes about religions the author clearly doesn't understand. For example, the author suggests that practitioners of Kabbalah disregard traditional Orthodox Judaism. She also likens the Christian Coalition to the Taliban. I'm really surprised this book got so many good reviews. I found it to be mostly banal at best."
"Positive","This product changed my life: What can I say that already hasn't been said? I'm in my mid 30s and have been battling pretty serious underarm sweating since high school. I tried *everything* to mask the problem...multiple shirts, jackets, undershirts with underarm pads, you name it. Nothing worked - I simply soaked right through anything I threw at the problem. At work? What a nightmare. I either avoided or escaped situations where I had to get in front of a group. Talk about a career limiting issue.Then I found this product, and.....wow! The sweating has *completely* disappeared, even after 2 or 3 days without usage. Certain Dri is a miracle in a 1.2 fl oz bottle. The only complaint is underarm discomfort if too much product is used, and a little compensentory sweating in other areas.I would easily pay 4x time price.Thank you Certain Dri!"
"Positive","Insightful and charming, especially in these times: Mr. Ready's examination of the life of Tolkein and the lives of his creations--or subcreations--is deep, astute, and as wonderfully explained as some of Tolkein's own best words. Profound comparisons of Tolkein's characters and plots to themes about goodness, death, and even politics are compressed into a mere 96 pages in this little paperback. I found that I better understood Tolkein, C.S. Lewis, and the ""Inklings"" with each paragraph, and I gained an even deeper appreciation for the Rings trilogy. With our own Sauron trampling what's left of our own Middle Earth in the U.S., I appreciate Tolkein's foresight as explained by Ready. If you are a devotee of Tolkein, then this book should be included in your library and nevermind the criticisms of the over-educated, possibly jealous, reviewers who have given a thumb's down here."
"Negative","Good Subject, Weak Writer: The writer knows his stuff and I'm sure has made a great living applying it to the markets. The problem is his communication skills from a teaching or ""how to"" point-of-view are pathetic. He would have been better off giving the material to a professional writer. The problem is, he's just not thorough with each subject and leaves more questions than provides answers."
"Negative","Linkin Park betrayed me!: I think it is rather safe to say that LP has officially gone to pot. Most of the songs on this album sound the same. How heavy metal is that? I mean, there are no guitar solos, mostly synthetic drumming, and rap! Trust me, rap and rock do not mix.About a year ago I borrowed Hybrid Theory from a friend with very low expectations. However, I was completely blown away! It was excellent. This is just sad. Do yourself a favor and listen to Hybrid Theory instead. Or listen to some other good bands (e.g. Foo Fighters, Green Day, Fountains of Wayne, Trapt, or Yellowcard). Steer away from this poor excuse for an album. I will give it this though, Don't Stay, Faint, Breaking the Habit, and Numb are all pretty good songs. The rest are just pathetic."
"Positive","Good product; radio/TV digital channels could be user-friendlier: Great for all my cassettes, and I love having the TV channels along with the radio. I just wish the digital functions were a lot easier to use for the radio stations. It would be much quicker using an old-fashioned dial for the radio."
"Negative","Not a how to book: Had some ok spatterings of information , but overall I found it a bit dissapointing. Its a fairly big book but doesnt seem to really show anthing ground breaking. If I had seen it before hand I wouldn't buy it again. Thats not to say in the right hands this book wouldn't be handy .Has some interesting info on how to make your own hinges, apart from that the rest is pretty standard stuff."
"Negative","this item is not as pictured: the picture shows a circular sharpener which is why i purchased it.... it is not circular its one of those flattened ovals which i do not like.... also there is not much diamond dust on the blades.... the price is definatley not worth it,,, i delibrately passed on several oval sharpeners and bought this because it was not stated as oval and the picture shows it as round...update.... i decided to look at the product and try it rather than send it back.... glad i did the plastic tip is cracked and broken and been glued back together and then glued to to end of the product... it was probably dropped on the end, also it seems to be used which accounts for not being as course as 'I' think it should be..."
"Negative","Where is my stuff: I bought this set on Dec 4th and paid for 2 day shiping. No knives!!!!! Then i wanted to contact amazon no contact info what the hell is going on here."
"Negative","Disappointed: I couldn't wait to get these can chillers, but my experience with them has been a real disappointment. They probably are as good as an ordinary can cover, but certainly nothing more. How do different people have such different results from products?, where some are just delighted and others have poor results?"
"Negative","Piece of crap!: First, no instructions or hints as to how to use it, position it, whether it goes just around the balls, dick plus balls, or just around the shaft, but that's minor compared to the lousy construction: the little knob at the end of the center pull-release shaft WILL come off in your hand. There are more comfortable alternatives... a plain rubber tube like the nurse uses on your arm when you get a blood test!"
"Positive","Great stuff!: I agree with the writer who suggests making it a topping for hotcakes or waffles. I, however, use it straight. I also suggest buyers look on the Dutch Gold website for recpies. My office loved the roasted walnuts topped with buckwheat honey."
"Negative","Test?: Is this a test to see if people will still buy a book this bad? It's simply amazing that it was published, in hard cover no less. What a world!"
"Negative","WARNING - Info NOT correct for (some?) Camry V6 models,: I triple checked DENSO and AMAZON web pages for the front end O2/Fuel sensors. They say 234-9007 and 234-9009 are ""correct"" front end sensors for 2000 Camry V6. NOT. The correct sensor is 234-4626 for both banks. The -9007 and -9009 sensors trigger CHECK ENGINE light. KEY - The electric connector ""TABS"" are slightly different. If they don't match the original, DON'T use it. I matched up the TAB configuration for the electric connector on the DENSO web page, which indicated the -4626. My bad ... I shaved the ""tab"" ends to make the -07 and -09 fit. I now have quasi-new aprox $200 of sensor junk. Paying for an education in O2 sensor hell :-)) Good Luck."
"Positive","Dark and Delightful: O.K., so here's the plan. Start with Mieville's ""Un Lun Dun"". Then move on to Gaiman's ""Neverwhere"". Then advance to Simon R. Green's Nightside books, (say, ""Something From the Nightside"").That way you can have a lot of fun with how cleverly Mieville lays his alternate London right over the top of ""real"" London. Enjoy the zest and unruly imagination of a deeply original writer.Then compare with the almost stately, restrained elegance of Gaiman's approach to alternate-London. Gaiman's imagination is just boundless, and every page is infused with his great sense of place, and his deft touch. Sure the book is ""dark"", but only in a thrilling sense, not the world weary, or ironic, or hopeless style of many current writers.For a change-up go to the Nightside of London, with the noirish, tongue-in-cheek, and much more fantastical Green.Really, what a trifecta."
"Positive","A great toy for kids 4 and up!!: I read so many review from parents who bought this toy for kids under 4 years old. The toy clearly states it is for kids 4 and up!!! We bought this for my son for Christmas when he was 3 1/2 years old. He loved it, but had a hard time putting the pieces together. We helped him a lot, but he still really enjoyed it. Now that he is 4, he plays with it all of the time and can easily put the pieces together with a very little, if any, help. We have several of the add-on pieces, as well as the pirate ship and boat rescue set. He plays with them all and uses his imagination to put pieces from the different sets together. We plan on getting more sets/pieces this Christmas. It is a great toy!!! I really rely on other parents reviews on products before I purchase toys, especially the expensive toys, but when parents write bad reviews because they bought a toy that was obviously not intended for a child too young for it, it really bugs me."
"Negative","I wish no stars were an option: I believe catching every disease on earth at once would be more pleasant than watching this movie. It's not even worth a penny, which is probably how much they spent making this film. Save yourself time, money, sanity and I.Q. points RUN AWAY!"
"Negative","Get a Cheat Code and Go To Town: Tresspasser is a prime example of a game that is better played as a hunting sim than as an action game. For some REAL fun, forget the gameplay. Get the cheat codes for unlimited ammo and unlimited firearms, grab the AK and go for the jugular. Or for even MORE fun, cheat freeze the dinosaurs, go right up to their fanged heads, and execute them a la Schindler's List style.The physics engine is frustrating. Stacking boxes only to have them fall over is a pain. Unfortunately, you have to do it. There is no ""sticky box"" cheat code.Ultimately, if you want to shoot dinos, go for Carnivore II or another dino sim. This one... eh..."
"Negative","Thought it would be good: I read about Cheyenne in Girls' Life magazine and thought ""Wow! She sounds like she's a great singer!"" So I borrowed the CD from my cousin. Her voice sounds funny and it sounds like her guitar wasn't tuned. I think, though, that she is a singer who will get better as she gets older."
"Negative","Quoting the Movies is NOT Writing a Book.: This is the most unimaginative Star Wars book I have yet read. It's almost like Mr. Anderson was afraid to develop the characters beyond the original trilogy. They don't even use original dialogue half the time! Also, Mr. Anderson has a problem with killing off characters: namely, he can't. Admiral Daala survived against all odds one too many times for me to care anymore, and the way Callista attacks her is crazily improbable. Read the New Jedi Order instead, one of the characters might actually die."
"Negative","Very confusing and for real dummies.: I think this book was very confusing. It was very difficult to find things about different subjects because the index and the summary didn't give me many choices and information. And the content is only for real dummies. As I have an intermediate knowledgment of Internet, it was not very useful for me. At least the language is very friendly and easy."
"Negative","Do not choose it as your first finance texkbook.: I was required to use this book in my first year MBA, and found that finance is too tough to study. And I was almost discouraged to select finace as my major ONLY BEFORE I found ""Analysis for Financial Management"" by Robert C. Higgins. DO NOT read Brealey & Myers if it is your first finance textbook!"
"Negative","Xiu Xiu fans, beware!: The sound quality is absolutely TERRIBLE, I was cringing the entire time I was watching this. The director seems to think that all Xiu Xiu songs are about break-ups over text messages, smoking cigarettes and other things 16 year-old girls might think as ""deep and cool"". This dvd is actually close to ruining the songs rather than enhancing them. I was expecting this to be just a live performance, but no, there's lame music videos by high school students mixed in. Don't waste your time or money. The director obviously does not understand this band or their music at all, I'm wondering why they even did this...actually, never mind, they totally put this out to get scene points."
"Positive","Good tripod: I bought this tripod for visiting antelope canyon. I searched amazon and decided to buy this one because pretty good review and cheap price. After I got it, I found it is easy to use and it is a good tripod comparing its cheap price."
"Positive","Excellent clips / very sturdy: These clips are excellent - brightly colored, high quality, and they grip onto anything."
"Negative","Not as good as the original at ALL: I bought this for my son for his 2nd Birthday, he loves Curious George. His ""red"" Curious George book, The ""original"" adventures of Curious George was falling apart, we have read it so many times. So when I found out about this book, I was really excited and ordered it for him right away. Well, it was kind of a waste of money. After reading two of the ""blue"" George stories, he was back to asking for the ""red"" George. He actually shut the book while I was reading it to him during the story where George and The Man w/the Y hat go to the ski lodge. I don't know how to explain, these stories have the same redundant plot line that the ""red"" George book has (Man w/Y hat is not paying attention, monkey gets into trouble, trouble is solved in unlikely way, the end) but they are written differently. The illustrations look slightly different too. I would save your money if you're thinking about getting this book."
"Negative","Personalized with STICKERS! And crummy ones at that...: We received this order only to find out the already relatively cheap life ring was personalized with cheap stickers. These stickers were already peeling off upon removing it from the shipping bag! You can tell they were put on my hand because they were not even straight. Wow. $49.99 for a $5 life ring and 20 cent stickers. They did offer to take it back, or this would be a 1 star, but we're still out the $10 shipping. Avoid. Get a sharpie and make your own. It would probably look better anyway."
"Negative","So - So: These are comfortable (3 diff sizes cover), sound great and a decent price. However, after receiving these in early June, it's the end of July and the connection to the plug is failing. The right side bud only works when the connection is in just the right spot.Over all, a comfortable bud with very good sound and poor quality."
"Negative","Poor literaure: This story is a boring tale of everyday Cuba. I could not find anything intereing in it. The only good thing is the title, because it describes exactly what it this book about: nothing (= nada). I have read other books that also talks about Cuban everyday life with a much better literary quality. I would not recommend it."
"Positive","Fun Collar -- I think our cat loves it: this is a GREAT collar for the price... looks exactly as pictured. Shipping from this vendor was fast (but a little pricey). Really fun collar"
"Negative","Be careful about EXP Date = 01/2010: If you click to see the seller's comments:Comments: ***THESE ARE DATED 01/2010***** OUR LOWER PRICES ARE BASED ON THE SLIGHTLY DAMAGED PACKAGING . SOME ITEMS WITH DATING ALSO HELPS WITH A LOWER PRICE SO PLEASE READ!! !!!!! DAMAGED PACKAGE!!!!!So how quickly can you consume 30 tablets? If you follow drug makers dosage 1 daily. So you may not even have time to finish the tablets before they expire."
"Negative","Still trying to recover: I'm running Win ME and have a C and a D hard drive. I did back up the C drive because it has most all of the OS stuff and it was the only drive I wanted to partation. I tryed installing the software three time within Windows and it stopped at the point of retriving the system files. So I rebotted to DOS with the reboot disk I made and tried to just partation the C drive. It took all my files on the C drive and made one partation of which I couldn't get into, I could copy it to a free space on another drive so I picked D drive. I then had a partation on C drive that I couldn't get into and a copy on the D drive of the C partation of which I still couldn't get into and all the file on the D drive were now in their own partation of which I couldn't get into. I had to reformat both drives and restore the C drive from the backup and I'm still trying to restore what I had on the D drive"
"Negative","A Major Dissapointment For this Primus Fan: Why doesn't Primus rock anymore? This stuff just isn't as listenable as their early work. Quit telling silly stories and go back to writing music!"
"Negative","WORST MOVIE EVER!!: EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD SUDDENLY GOES BLIND EXCEPT FOR ONE PERSON. A FEW WEEKS LATER, THEY GET THEIR SIGHT BACK. NO EXPLANATION OR REASON WHY. SURE, THE MOVIE MAKES YOU THINK A BIT ABOUT THE ""WHAT IF SCENARIO"" OF HUMAN CO-EXISTENCE, BUT THERE'S NO REAL SUBSTANCE. PLUS THE REALITY THAT THIS COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN IS ABSURD. MY SUGGESTION IS DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME..."
"Negative","Arrived broken: Sent this as a gift to a friend. It arrived while I happened to be visiting my friend. It was broken in the box. Ambarassing and disappointed! Lid was detached from the pot - CHEAP junk!"
"Negative","Mossy Oak License Plate Frame: Bought this same item from Walmart,it did not fit good against my existing Jeep tag mount plus the colors faded bad due to sun exposure."
"Negative","way too fast....not what I would consider yoga: I bought this based on a friend's recommendation...but I wouldn't call it yoga. He moves way too quickly...no time to get into poses for advanced people, and no learning of poses for beginners."
"Positive","Made me think deeply: This book was great. I like travel books, and if you're smart enough to understand this one, you'll love it. This book's insights gave me a new spiritual clarity."
"Positive","This isn't just about funny pictures of dogs: I got it for my mother, who is a big fan of the Wegman calendars. She found it interesting, even though it's not just about the dogs- there is a good deal of depth to the art, and the book conveys it. But don't expect a picture book analog of the calendars."
"Positive","Four Stars for A Year Down Yonder: I read the book A Year Down Yonder by Richard Peck. I gave this book four star. The book was very well written and was a lot of fun to read. The book is about a girl who has to go live with her grandmother until her family can bring in more money. During her stay she is part of many events. One of them were when her cat had a kitten. When the painter that comes to stay with them invites a woman over and a snake is found in the ceiling. They even have a turkey shooting. Don't worry they don't use real turkey's. Those are only some of the fun and exciting events that happen. So if you want to find out if Mary Alice's parents can get more money so they can bring her home and find out about more of the funny things that happen then pick up this book."
"Positive","As advertised: There's not much to say about this speaker cable except that it works as advertised. This was the perfect amount to configure a 5.1 setup in my small living room. The cable is thick (definitely appears to be 16-Gauge) and it works. No complaints, especially for the price."
"Positive","Excellent small business phone: This phone is great for our 6 person business. Four of our employees work in our upstairs office space, and two of us are on the lower level. We have particularly enjoyed the intercom feature which allows us to interface without yelling up and down the stairwell! A great price for a great product!"
"Negative","Feeling uncomfortable with Junger's conclusions: Mr. Junger has led the reader to believe that Roy Smith would have been unlikely to have committed a capital offense, based on his previous criminal record. Absolutely untrue. Hasn't Mr. Junger told us that Roy Smith put a revolver to the head of a woman and the only thing saving her from sure death was that the weapon misfired.According to several sources Mr. Smith was convicted and the conviction was upheld under appeal.Mr. Junger........nice reading, but it's fiction, not non-fiction."
"Positive","Childhood Memories: After watching this dvd set of The Adventures of Superman, all I can say is it brought back a lot of childhood memories. I hope to get the next set Season 5 & 6."
"Negative","Didn't last 5 Min!: I was VERY disappointed! My 1 year old pup had this toy destroyed within 5 minutes! Would not recommend for a chewer!"
"Positive","Looks great on Blu-Ray: Absolut fanastic restored and this 50 years old movie looks great. Now its like a new movie experience - like filmed just a few months ago. Clean, sharp, wonderful color and now you can see details you've never seen bevor!The actors are great: Hurd Hatfield (my favorite actor), Rita Gam, Jeffrey Hunter.The only big minus: where are (expcept the short one) the bonus features????? It would be interesting to see a Making of, but well....still love it!"
"Negative","Poorly made: This looked like the one we had for 20 years, but it wasn't. As soon as we pressed a couple of limes, the part of the juicer that the lime sits on (both the cone-shaped piece and the piece that it sits in) are made of thin flimsy metal making it ineffective as a juicer. They bent the first time we used it. I am returning it and will not buy another one from this company."
"Positive","Fascinating Subject: I am an a electrical engineer who has usually followed a very western medical science oriented view of health and fitness. I became interested in meditation and breathing becuase of the death of someone who was close to me. I bought this book, originally because I was interested in self healing. What I got out of it was a much stronger sense of who I am and and what I am doing with my own life, in addition to healing. Mark Rich gives a much bigger picture of who we are and how we function energetically. There are other books out there on this subject but this one seems to be written very matter of factly and straight to the point. I can relate to that! Highly recomended!"
"Negative","A good band gone to waste!: DON'T BOTHER GETTING THIS! IF YOU WANT KORN GET ANY OF THE OTHER CDS BUT STAY FAR AWAY FROM UNTOUCHABLES!"
"Positive","Loved it: I bought this for my father who is very spiritual and into meditation and yoga. He loved the book and thats good enough for me!"
"Positive","Bottlefly: I have seen Bottlefly live in the U.K a number of times. A great c.d...A great band to see play live."
"Negative","Eye candy and weak on history: I didn't read the entire book, simply browsed it for about 20 min while my daughter shopped for books in the kids section of the bookstore. However, it doesn't take much more than 20 min to get through it. The book is nothing but a timeline of miscellaneous events and grouped by presidency. Each event is covered by no more than a couple of sentences. You might learn some trivia going through it but not much else. It is also not a very objective view of US history - not a single ""factoid"" given for the 8 years of the Clinton presidency was positive, only negatives."
"Negative","Wanted to like it...: This book rings false. Katherine Weber probably tried really hard to pull off this Alcott thing, but her ""plot"" and phrasing is quite off."
"Positive","Fond memories...: A few days ago I started to remember loving this book as a kid. It took me two days of internet searches to finally find the name, and it comes up out of print. I want to buy multiple copies of it for my nephews. Hopefully it will be available soon."
"Negative","Watery-RATOR: I am a big fan of margaritas. I was so excited when I found this machine hoping for the perfect margarita. After using it I thought this was nothing but a piece of junk! I paid a nintey bucks for one of these and it was worse than my 14 dollar blender. You pretty much have to make a gallon at a time to even get it to be slushy ice mixture but by the time you add enough ice, your drinks taste like a bad watered down mexican restauarant 2 for 1 margaritas. I followed the instuctions which are not very precise, says wait 6 to 8 min but it actually took the machine about 15-20 minutes. Oh and after about an hour it all melts down. After wasting about 40 bucks worth of tequila on this trying diff techniques I took mine back to Walmart. The customer service rep also told me it wasnt the first one that was returned for the same reason. SAVE YOUR MONEY! A Cheap blender works better than this!"
"Negative","Only Just OK: This DVD contains nothing new about London. It is disappointingly short and contains predictable video of the same old tourist spots in London. Don't waste your money."
"Negative","Big cage for your buck - HUGE pain to clean.: I was looking for a cage for our 6 female ratties, and the size is great! The down side is cleaning...we ended up taking the slide out, it just was too much of a problem to put back on after every washing...the purple shelves are a BIG pain to clean (they ""snap"" back on - and it's not easy - awkward and bulky). If you do have adolescent rats (2 to 3 months old), they will be able to squeeze through the bar spacing -- we had to elevate ours off the floor on a large end table, so they couldn't get to the floor below. All in all, it's alot of cage for your buck. It has spurred us to get a Critter Nation cage though. The cleaning issue is just a big one with this cage."
"Positive","easy to install: I am very happy with my shower filter. It was easy to install also.The filter arrived a few days after I ordered it. I am very pleasedwith Amazon and their service."
"Negative","where are my cheap sunglasses: the glasses are taking forever! they are already about a week late so...I am just going to buy a good pair of sunglasses because they will probably get here before these sunglasses do if they even get here.."
"Positive","Ballplaying Dogs: For dogs that like to play ball, this is an excellent product. Mandy needs exercise that I cannot give her, and the ball provides this for anyone who has an area where their dog can play,"
"Negative","Waste of an evening: My husband and I expected an amazing film-it has an incredible cast and it was listed on someone's Amazon list along with other greats like ""Downton Abbey,"" Cranford,"" and ""Bleak House."" It turned out to be, I think, my least favorite film that I've ever watched-partially because the expectations were initially so high, partly because it leaves one feeling so ""blegh."" Not in a thoughtful, sorrowful way captured by, say, many Russian novelists, but just deep disappointment at the films mediocrity. Please don't waste your time with this one-I wish that we hadn't wasted money and time on this."
"Negative","Dissapointed with Ingredient List: Dissapointed with ingredient list. Because this is marked Organic i would expect ingredient list to be ""prunes"", but it includes tuna oil. Won't be buying. Enough said."
"Negative","Disappointing: Years after falling in love with this musical at a London performance, I bought this CD to bring back the memories. Unfortunately, it only tainted them. The recording sounds flat, the performances are operatically overblown, and the choral arrangements quickly become annoying. Maybe I just remembered the original stage performance as being better than it was."
"Negative","Very Dissapointed,: You know, it figures. No one watched Family Guy when it was on TV in 1999 and even though it was completely hilarious it got cancelled. Then A.S. picks it up and it explodes in popularity. Then finally FOX brings it back with a new season and everyone begins to watch it. However, there is a catch and that catch is that, well, quite frankly, the new seasn pretty much sucks. The first episdoe was good, but almost every other episode is pretty much completely dispensible. I definitely do not recomend this."
"Negative","Lexmark makes lousy products: I've owned two Lexmark printers, and both of them did not last two years. One had problems after 3 months of usage--would not print in black ink. The other one lasted two years, and it also stopped printing in black ink. I've tried installing new cartridges, and I've tried their ink nozzle cleaning program on numerous occasions--it doesn't help to fix the problem. I will never voluntarily buy a Lexmark product, ever again."
"Negative","Dreadful writing.: This book is so unappealing, so boring and so full of lazy, endless repetition on the part of the writer that I can't even be bothered to write out a proper review. Just skip it."
"Negative","It not work: It did not work, just on and off the doors but the alarm is not activated or disabled. Send an email to the four technical advisers and only one answered but I still could not be put to work.I put in the jar of thing does not work."
"Positive","LOVE IT!!!: The Kindle2 is awesome! Never had the 1st one but totally love this one. I am definately enjoying reading more and it's nice not having to turn pages; I can read with my dog on my lap a lot easier!"
"Positive","Epiphany: This book was the first book that helped me understand who I was, and what being an artist means. I always knew that I was different from the majority of people, but did not really understand why. After this book I became more in peace with myself and with a much more positive attitude towards my work. I highly recommend it and recommend you give it to your loved ones who are not artists, so they will empathise more with your world."
"Positive","Deer in the Headlights: I felt like a deer confronted with an on coming car. The book was disturbing but, once engaged, I could not turn away. At age 56, I remembered the historical references which I had not thought about for ages. It's the forgetting that claims us all...which comforts us all. Upon completion, I was left with a chilling understanding and, surprisingly, a sense of forgiveness for things I'm happy to not have witnessed in my life. Time does not heal all wounds and honesty, with ourselves, seems impossible when life gets too hard to witness. A conclusion that makes me more convinced not to judge that which I do not know. Gripping...disturbing...thought provoking."
"Negative","Disappointly modern: I was extremely disappointed when I finally got my hands on this book, because I was expecting another Dover-style collection of period house plans. I was unimpressed by the ""Victorian-inspired"" designs because they're only Victorian enough to fool the casual observer. Only the ones from Historical Replications were any good in my opinion, and there were precious few of those. All the rest were rambling modern homes with a few cornices and a porch, only the outsides referencing real Victorian architecture."
"Negative","Ridiculous and Pointless!: Sophie Jacobs sits in the car while her boyfriend, Hugh, gets some stuff in a store. The store is robbed with people shot. Everything else afterwards is either real or fantasy.(Hint: was Sophie a witness to the crime?)I chuckle when people see this type of movie and say that they guessed the ending within the first 5 minutes because I know that's not true, but in November's case, it's really true. There's a clip during the title credits that's a major spoiler.The movie itself is dull and lifeless. The story is told and retold with no direction. This movie is a build-up to the end which is a real let down. The only thing that's worth noting is the cinematography. The film moves from pale, to rouge, to finally a colorful shade. The acting is solid but who cares? The story is a disaster!"
"Positive","TiVo wireless adaptor: Quick to ship and arrive, price better than from TiVo. Only annoyance is that TiVo requires a specialized wireless G USB adaptor."
"Positive","Great book. I'm going to read the next in the series too.: Great book. A complex world with a complex plot, where the main protagonists learn about who they are while they slowly learn the truth about their political leaders and their home world's religion."
"Positive","Rodney Yee's Roga for Beginners: Having never done yoga before I found this DVD very enlightening and challenging. I'd recommend this for anyone wanting to start yoga as there is a full instruction clip on all the posses used, the segments are relatively short, and it is challenging since the movements are new to most people who haven't tried yoga. You will find yourself returning to it again and again to get better at the movements and poses or just for fun."
"Positive","The best Twilight ever: This was an excellent movie. I loved this movie from the very beginning and will buy this. I am not into the books, But I should do love the movies. I will definately buy this movie."
"Positive","Satisfying King: As Stephen King gets older, his books get bigger, as seems to happen to most authors. Sometimes though, they fail to satisfy. This one did not.Coming off of his horrible accident where he was hit by a van, King included a lot of his pain and feelings of growing older in this book. It makes the book more personal, and more refreshing. There is the true Stephen King in the emotions of the characters.Being an alien invasion book, I enjoyed it too for it's unique spin on alien life, and how they might invade. I don't think this was overall as creepy as some of his other works have been, though this certainly had its moments.All that said, the book wasn't literary greatness, but I wasn't expecting it to be. It was a horror novel by King, and it was entertaining. I wasn't expecting anything but that.But I'm glad I read it. Well done."
"Positive","One of a few: One of those rare books that REALLY change your life. Gave two as gifts weeks after starting to read my copy (which was a gift from a new friend). Open yourself to great teaching and let the journey begin."
"Positive","Great Entertainment: I purchased this series DVD of Jericho for my husband's birthday. He used to like the show when it was on. I didn't realize how much I would love watching it with him. Excellent series."
"Negative","Let's go for ""faithful"" rather than ""effective"": Attempts to moderate somewhat between the church growth advocates and the traditional side, but falls short on many counts. The title itself is a foretaste of what is to come, i.e. good advice on how to be more ""effective,"" such as people techniques, organization, etc., but why not concentrate on the more biblical concept: ""faithful.""Consider the Pastor Paul writing advice to Pastors Tim and Titus. Never does he talk about this quality and effectiveness and efficiency that most books deal with on pastors who want success. Teach the word purely. Be a bondslave to the gospel of Christ. Expect attack. Lean on the Lord. Sheep will safely graze and pasture, under a watchful shepherd's eye.Means means well in what he offers. Much good to combat the modern tendencies to lead the flock with more consideration of what the sheep want. I found him talking on both sides much of the time."
"Positive","worth it: the outer box is not very strong, so u can not lift this thing with handle but overall its value for money."
"Positive","StriVectin-SD: I have loved and used this product for years and have bought it at health stores. It has been quite expensive but worth the results. Then I discovered I could order it from Amazon for considerably less than over the counter prices. What a great bargain."
"Negative","Waste of Money: I purchased this hoping it would be a good bluetooth headset, but found out through experience that this was a poor choice. My wife and clients always state that they can not hear me. I usually get the response while driving or outside with wind as little as a light breeze."
"Negative","Caution: You may lose a bit of the magic....: This is a very well written book about the inner workings and secrets of Disneyland. For me though, being a huge Disneyland fan, I lost a little bit of the Disney magic. I do not need to know that some of the past cast members called it ""Dismal Land"" and hated their jobs; or that there has been a murder at DL; or some of the other disturbing events. I walked away after reading this book with a bit of sadness; the magic that I feel when I walk through those gates will be forever tarnished, and I deeply regret reading this book."
"Negative","Junky: Folks buy these things thinking they are an eco friendly way to get fresh tasting safe(r) water. I hate to break the news to you, it's not eco-friendly if it uses dozens of non-recyclable filters AND falls apart within a couple of years. Mine has failed after about 18 months.I have read other reviews where folks are buying 2 and 3 of these things. HONESTLY! Why? Mine has not only leaked since I bought it. 1st it leaked from the faucet coupling, but now the actual (metal looking) plastic seam has split on the filter housing and is spraying all over the place. And yes, I change the filter as directed. It's fake metal disposable garbage and is wasteful. We have to start sending a message to Pur et al and stop Re-buying crap that lets us down. I have extra filters I have no idea what I am going to do with, but I am not buying another throw-away piece of JUNK from Pur."
"Negative","Software problems on Blu-ray: Waited for this dvd for ages and when I recieved this dvd it was faulty I have since returned it. They haven't process the Blu-ray part of it properly."
"Positive","One of the Greats: I see it as an angel with a temporary assignment to inspire a deep love in a woman who sadly lived in a time and place that gave her slim chances of obtaining it. This is one of infinite ways God could be Husband to the widow. Even the most cynical person will be moved by the final scenes guaranteed."
"Positive","making the racks better: This oven roasts beautifully, as long as the food is exposed to the air. I like to roast vegetables and often cut them into small pieces before doing so. The grilling rack that comes with the Deni has spaces large enough so that small vegetables can fall through, onto the oven floor. To avoid this, I bought a couple of ""disposable"" smaller-meshed grills (I found them at the barbeque section of my grocery store) and used kitchen sheers to cut them to fit inside the deni, one to a grill rack. To make them safe to handle, I used pliers to fold down the cut edges. I brushed the inserted grills with oil, laid the veggies on the top of them, and roasted them. Beautiful! And the ""disposable"" grills aren't disposable at all; they wash easily and store inside the Deni.I bought this item because it's made of glass, incidentally. I did not want to have to worry that the top would crack."
"Negative","exceptionally poorly constructed reference book: A real need for further editions on this book. As others have commented, it's very poorly constructed, poorly indexed and you'll be hard-pressed to quickly find accurate definitions. As other posters have suggested, O'Reilly should be worried that this one got published in this state."
"Negative","Arrived damage, took 3 months for refund: When the stand arrived, all 3 panes of glass were broken. I immediately contacted the seller (gizmosforlife), who was responsive at first, but did not refund my money in a timely fashion."
"Positive","This book changed my life!: Guided by the book, I started the SCD diet in June 2007 (9 months ago). At the time I was on Remicade and had had a bowel resection for my Crohn's disease. I have suffered for over 20 years with the disease and my doctor said I would be on Remicade for the rest of my life. After being on the diet for only 3 months, my insurance changed so drastically that I could not afford the Remicade. With great trepidation, I took myself off of it. I have now been off of Remicade for 6 months. While I am still healing, my life is so very different than it was a year ago. I never miss work, I have no pain, I no longer need to plan my life around trips to the restroom. I credit the book, God, and the diet for my miraculous healing. The diet is very difficult and I really did not think I had the will power to tackle it. I am so glad that God gave me the strength. Although the SCD diet is quite restrictive, it is not as restrictive as inflammatory bowel disease!"
"Negative","Creepy stories for kids: While the Curious George portion of this video is ok (my daughter loves it). The other stories are downright morbid and creepy. They gave me nightmares, let alone my kid. I don't understand why such weirdness was lumped together with something as wholesome as Curious George."
"Negative","Two stars for redux five for the original: Let me begin with saying that apocalypse now is one of my all time favorite movies so i was excited when i saw that they had rereleased it and then i saw in and now know why the scenes included in this version were deleted in the first place, because they take away from the continuity of the story line to me they became a destraction and towards the end were just plain annoying. You cannot improve on perfecton as this DVD proves so save some money and just buy the original."
"Positive","Comprehensive book on all aspects of porous pavement: A very comprehensive book on the many aspects of porous pavement. It is very easy to read and includes numerous real world cases. It is not so much a design book with formulas as much as a general reference book."
"Positive","Covers all models objectively, no specific preference: Kind of dry style coverage of production, no personal reflections, anecdotes or biases. Most pictures black and white. But there aren't many books telling this story so for those interested in the subject it should rate as a neccessary reference in the bookshelf.There is a brilliant chapter there about the RE-5 Rotary. Useful for all the pictures of models."
"Negative","Wells tries hard: Jonathan Wells goal is clear. He attempts to debunk evolution by pointing out textbook errors; however, one does not overturn science by pointing out publishing errors. The proper way to go about arguing against a well-established paradigm is in the scientific literature. Wells is strangely silent in the scientific venue and one can only assume that he hopes to overcome real science by appealing to the masses through the use of 'spin' rhetoric. Wells contribution will no doubt find favor among his ye-creationist brethren, but he offers little in the way of useful scientific argument. Apparently, he thinks that pointing out errors in High school and college textbooks is the same thing as basic research. This book is of little use in promoting ye-creationism or refuting his Quixotic nemesis."
"Negative","The idea is great but the product is very rough: You thought your desktop crashed a lot? Well then, just get a Replay TV. With reds being replaced by a blinding bright white, lost recordings, screwy download times that are sometimes totally ineffective, anyone would be better off waiting until they figure this one out. And they will, believe me, because the idea is great. When Replay works as it is supposed to I am aghast at the power it gives the person to create their own programming instead of depending on a bunch of bozos to do it for them. Good product, ain't up to snuff yet. Too darn expensive too.BTW, don't get the shortest recording one, I believe it is the 2020, as you will regret not having the extra space. I have their top of the line and in three weeks already had filled up their hard drive. Forces you to watch your TV too quickly."
"Positive","great product: I use these for my bank owned listings, and I always keep buying them. They aren't the cheapest option out there, but they are hard to break into."
"Positive","Excellent: This book has everything a reader looks for in a historical novel -- a strong plot, believable characters, romance and suspense, and lots of interesting historical detail. If you're a fan of historical fiction, you'll enjoy this book."
"Negative","Boring and Silly: Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a boring, silly film. It's hard to believe that Alfred Hitchcock had anything to do with this. I wasted over an hour watching it and it's just not worth spending any more time reviewing it. Not a good film."
"Negative","Ponderous: The premise of this novel, and the opening chapters, are phenomenally provocative and engaging. But about 1/4 of the way into the book, Herbert veers into philosophical musings and a plethora of unecessary characters. I found myself skipping paragraph after paragraph."
"Positive","Gimmicky, But Worthwhile: I loved this book despite my criticisms. Naslund's use of language is beautiful. I'd read anything she writes for the sheer joy of her ability to express herself. But, she can be contriving. The plot is driven much the way ""Forest Gump"" was, with the protagonist being inserted into any historical or socially relevant situation manifesting itself during the time the book took place.The book starts out with a catchy line, that is irrelevant to where the story begins, but serves to evoke a curiosity about what kind of woman would have enticed and tolerated the likes of Ahab.Naslund has a great imagination, and as one can see in her later book, ""The Four Spirits"", an ability to write on a deeply personal level as well."
"Negative","Celebrating Mediocrity: This book was read at back-to-school night at Rosendale Elementary by the newly hired principal. The book celebrates mediocrity by framing in gold a half-hearted splotch of ink... once the teacher set such a low bar, the child thinks ""I've got talent"" and proceeds to create large quantities of mediocrity.It's all part of the dumbing down of quality and a feel-good educational system that rewards the smallest of effort."
"Positive","A Great Naruto Game: If you like ninjas,cartoons,or fighting games,this is the game for you! Naruto Clash of Ninja 2 for NGC is awesome. NCON2 features 23 total characters, a new 4-player mode, a longer story mode, and much more.The characters include:Naruto,Saska,Sakura,Kakashi,Iruka,Guy,Haku,Zabuza,Shicamaru,Ino,Neji,Hinata,Lee,Kiba/Akamaru,Kankura/Crow,Gaara,and others.As you can see,if you're considering buying this,BUY IT!P.S. It's rated T cause' it's a fighting game."
"Negative","Too small, makes a mess!: I really don't enjoy using this grinder. It makes a huge mess because the grounds stick to the grinding part and you have to tap it on the counter several times to get them to all come out. It barely holds enough for a pot of coffee, and if you overfill it (more than half full) it either shuts off or it doesn't ground all the beans. Coffee often gets stuck under where the button pushes so you have to unclog that area in order to make it work.Hey, I like coffee. I like a lot of dark, strong coffee and this coffee grinder just doesn't cut it!"
"Positive","best option for stereo for LG Chocolate: The LG Chocolate requires 2.5mm plug for wired headphones and these fit the bill -- in stereo which is what you need for the Chocolate (most 2.5 mm things are mono). Note you will still need the adapter that comes with the phone in order to use these headphones -- they don't plug directly into the phone. The packaging makes we wonder if these are really official Jabra equipment (there was a white sticker that said something about a ""special"" product version). Maybe it was something that Jabra decided wasn't going to be up to their standards. However they do match the features of the model number they indicate. This is going to be the best deal you're going to find on a stereo in-ear style headphones with bonus (fairly usable) hands-free functionality."
"Positive","Never buy Pam again!: This works great... pump it ten times and sprays just like Pam does. You will never have to buy Pam again"
"Positive","The best of his non-Bosch novels: Maybe it's because Harry Bosch was Connelly's first creation that his writing always seems to rise to a higher level when he's focusing on Bosch. Maybe it's because I read his Bosch novels first. Either way, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but I still can't help waiting for the next Bosch installment. This is a great book and if it were anyone else's novel, I'd probably give it 5 stars. Cassie Black is a strong character and I liked her and sympathized with her. It just doesn't matter to me if I don't see her in a sequel."
"Positive","Pretty Cool, but not The Whole Way: This movie ROCKS!! My aunt bought me this and I've loved it!She knows I like Sonic. I gave it a 4 outta 5 'cuase of Sonic's voice acting. At the beginning, he sounds relaxed and all cool. But in the middle of the movie, he sounds like an Englishman! What's up with that? And also, it's too dang short! I just want to see more after it's over! One pro is that catchy, ""Look Alike"" tune at the end. They should release that song as a single sooner or later. Anyway, it's a great movie and any sonic fan should get it. P.S. Who's cooler than Tails?!"
"Positive","Whoopi as she is!: I like Whoopi, her sense of timing is just so good. This movie was entertaining in that as a woman who has worked in company administration I could relate to the frustration. In order to be given credit due, it is still necessary to do everything the men do a little better and in high heels! So creating a male colleague who ends up taking all the credit seemed like a perfectly normal thing. All the chain reactions were just added fun."
"Negative","Great as long as there are no problems!: Purchased this for Christmas and is stopped working within 30 days. If there is a problem, you have to pay for shipping both ways and they will ""repair it, not replace it though it was recently purchased. In addition since we did not keep the packaging, Cuisinart recommends you take the unit to a UPS or Fedex store so the shipment can be packaged effectively and they tell you it will be a minimum of $10.00 to ship their product, that malfunctioned but they have repaired back to you. Very disappointed with someone with the name recognition that Cuisinart has cultivated. Other than breaking, the mixer worked okay for a couple of weeks."
"Negative","Illegible Typography: This product is a poor facsimile of a good lexicon. Letters are sometimes hardly legible and accents, breathing marks, and iota subscripts are often illegible."
"Positive","My favorite knife!: I had one of these for years as part of a set but it got lost somewhere along the line. I put off buying a new one because of the cost but now that I have it back I can honestly say it's worth the money and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one immediately if this one ever goes missing."
"Negative","Not even close to the quality of the movie: My main question, considering that there were quite a few good songs on the movie that SHOULD have been included on the soundtrack, but WEREN'T, is WHY? ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is one of my all-time favorite movies, but they weren't able to carry over the quality of the movie to the soundtrack at all. There are several songs on here I can't stand at all, and none I really love, despite having 2 bands I like listed (The Cardigans and Semisonic, who do give decent but not great contributions). The *Letters to Cleo* songs are okay but pretty shallow, and you can hear them in almost their entirity on the movie anyway, ditto on ""I Know"" by Save Ferris... ""Even Angels Fall"" and ""The Weakness in Me"" are the only other songs on this album worth much notice."
"Positive","Highly Influential, Somewhat Abrasive, Very Brilliant: Szwed made my day with the last sentence of his review. Indeed, the musical and other prejudices of past eras are fading into dust.This album was important. It plays like an intense, in-your-face declaration of black pride. European musical forms and instruments play only a secondary role; rhythm, pulse, and form rule the day.When listening to ""The Bomb Squad""'s early hip-hop masterpieces (particularly Public Enemy's second and third albums) I had no doubt that they listened to this music and were influenced by it. And this sound has really taken hold during the past 10 years. Nowadays even the lightest pop music is prone to bits of abstract abrasion or buzzing for effect during the chorus or elsewhere.It's a great concept for an album, and a great album."
"Positive","doesnt get any better than this: The wii is the Best and you must have enough controllers..its the first game Ive ever seen that gets my dear hubby and the grandkids out of their chairs and makes them sweat...gotta love it!"
"Negative","never again: Not worth my time especially for a book club..i had to read it and forced myself to read each page"
"Positive","Can't beat the price!: We bought 2 of these for Christmas gifts. I wouldn't have paid $40 for them but they were an excellent bargain at $10 each. I should have bought one for myself."
"Negative","Don't Waste Your Talent is the same book!!!: I read a great book by this author called ""Don't Waste Your Talent"" and the information about the lemming conspiracy was fascinating, so I searched for more. When I saw another book by the same author titled ""The Lemming Conspiracy"", I jumped at the chance to learn more. Bottom line, it was the same book as the other I had read. What is up with that????Love the book and certainly worth the read, just make sure you only buy one!Don't Waste Your Talent: The 8 Critical Steps To Discovering What You Do Best"
"Negative","too much text, not many pictures: I bought this book based on the reviews from other readers. I am somewhat a beginner to sewing. I do know how to setup the machine and sew a straight line, so I was looking to go beyond that. My problems with this book is that it had mostly a lot of text and not too many pictures. I would recommend ""The Complete Photo Guide to Sewing"" by Singer. The Reader's digest book DOES have a lot of detail and is more thorough. For a person who is serious about sewing, this is a good book. I was really looking for some basic tips and lots of how-to with pictures."
"Positive","Book Still Gets Five Stars but One for Frey: When I read this book a year ago, I found some aspects either ridiculous or too vague, and I assumed he exaggerated but accepted that as artistic license. I felt sorry for the guy and admired his strength to recover. Now America feels duped. He was a frat boy! He goes around making the Oprah scene and further embellishing on the details in his speaking appearances, and it looks like his parents are in on the joke. Enabling parents... drug user.... hmmm I see a pattern here. If only he had presented it as fiction. I give it five stars because it's a damn entertaining book. But James Frey gets one star for integrity."
"Negative","Disappointing--falls apart: I wish there had been other reviews to look at before I bought this toy for my 5-yr-old daughter. She is a real space enthusiast and was very excited about having a shuttle that an astronaut could ride in and that has a grabber arm. We experienced the same frustration as the other reviewers. The instructions were clear, but the toy doesn't stay together even with very light play. It would only be appropriate for a child who wants to build it and display it. I may try the Lego version. I only wish Playmobil made a space shuttle. My son got a wonderful Playmobil airplane that holds up well to active play."
"Negative","DO NOT BUY MINKA FANS!!!!: In addition to horrible customer service, the fans are poor quality. One of my fans was missing an internal blade bracket, causing the blade to go through the wall. The other stopped working within 1 year. Minka did not make good in either case. You would think they would be concerned that the blade could have killed someone. I know it is tempting to buy them because of their design, but DON'T!!!"
"Negative","Leaking tea kettle: We are on our third tea kettle by Hamilton Beach. Have liked the fact it is cordless. Nice stainless steel. Like the fact lid is removable. Poor quality though. Each one has leaked like a sieve. One was within the first month. They have always replaced them, free of charge. Sometimes it doesn't leak, most of the time it does. One even had the switch issue others talk about. When we call we have asked each customer rep if this has been an on going issue? You got it.....the answer is always no. Will not own another one and will not recommend that anybody buy it."
"Negative","Please enter a title for your review: this album marks a new level of arbitraryness in what the ""indie"" tastemakers will celebrate as music if not a new level to which music fans will sublimate actual enjoyment for the sake of avant garde fashion statements. tracks 3, 4, and 9 are listenable, the rest generally isn't. they don't know how to write a transition, it's all stop and start. they don't know how to create a rhythmmic flow, the instrumental layers generally seem at odds with each other. this is a mild curiosity at best, far from an artistic statement. in the 90s i didn't have much time for the experimentalism of June Of 44, Shellac, and Sweep The Leg Johnny, but next to Animal Collective, Hella, and Battles I'm starting to get nostalgic for that time when trendy experimentalism didn't veer quite so far from music."
"Negative","What Has Cuisinart Done?: I was the first my neighborhood to buy a Cuisinart 30 years ago. It served me very very well for all these years. Time to get a new one so I purchased this model. It was impossible to clean, very difficult to use, and died after 3 uses. Save yourself some grief."
"Negative","For young kids: I am an adult. I was excited to have picked this book up at a book fair. I really wanted to like this book. But , I couldnt finish it. The description says for 10 and up, should say 8-13. I found it too simple. Just couldnt get past a couple of chapters. I think anybody over the age of 13 will be frustrated. I am going to see if I can find an adult version...."
"Positive","The best Star Wars game since Outcast: First off, this Game starts off with one of the best cutscenes I've seen in a Star Wars game it also has a handful of genres one of which is suspense. The game has the best special affects I've seen on Xbox and side quests to unfold. But what I liked most about this game is when you find out your secret. Trust me when I say this game was well worth the $50 I paid for it."
"Positive","Great for large, heavy dogs: This is the only bed our Great Dane doesn't smash down flat after a few weeks. Zipper on cover doesn't last as long as bed does though."
"Negative","Do not waste your money: The recipes are time intensive and many are tasteless. Health food does not deservice the bad rap."
"Negative","Mixed Feelings: A powerhouse of academic scholarship, this book is the most tedious and boring biography I have ever read. Too many pages on Bacon's political career, too little on his scientific achievements."
"Negative","did not fit.: I guess they sold me the wrong part, because it didn't fit ford escort 1999, the space between the screws was to norrow."
"Negative","Incovenient to use: I chose this product because I wanted something that had a microphone (to take cell phone calls) and supports noise-cancellation. Audio quality is good, but the noise-cancellation is so-so. More than everything, the noise-cancellation casing (the rectangular box seen in the picture) makes it very inconvenient to carry around. Because of that, I have not used these ear phones much in the approx 5 months I've had them. I used them only when absolutely necessary, vs. every time I would have otherwise used them."
"Positive","Excelente e interesante: Muy pero muy interesante lo acabo de leer, y me encanto es realmente bueno te ensena mucho al menos a mi me ayudo muchas de las citas que se encuentran en este libro como no conformarse, si deseas algo luchar por ello, la importancia de la parte espiritual de cada persona que a pesar de las dificultades que puedas estar pasando siempre puedes tener esa paz que necesitas y de como a veces las personas con las que te encuentras en este camino de la vida pueden hacer una gran diferencia en tu vida, te hace pensar y meditar de lo que realmente vale y hace que aprecies mas la naturaleza , lo existente y lo que tienes. Creo que lo volveria a leer muchas veces mas."
"Positive","The reel deal - 50-60's Chicago R&B in a box.: If you love the variety of the 50-60's Chicago R&B sound this is for you. Great re-mastering job that defies it's half-century age revealing all the nuance and staging of the time. Enjoy!"
"Negative","A Great Series! I Guess.......................: I watch the suite life everyday.I think its a great show.I think i won't but this dvd.I mean 4 episodes is a waste.I can just ask my brother to record it with his dvd recorder.I'll buy it when its has all the episodes of the first season!"
"Positive","Just buy it!: This is a great CD and Ms. Lennox's voice is perfect. Don't even hesitate another minute and buy this CD!"
"Negative","Power Talk????: It seems as if authors and publishers have decided to sell something that is marginal at best, just include the words Power,Prestige, wealth all seemingly offering some simple strategy to imporove and empower your life, Power talk fails to live up to its title. It is a ok book on how we talk and what the 2 distinct communication styles are all about. But it doesnt take a 200 page book to tell us that the key is to merge the two? This book is geared towards salespeople and corporate executives, if you work for a firm of 20 or less this probably won't help much. The key to success is adaptation to the enviroment your in rather than discuss key words or stratagies for enhancing vocabulary, structure , etiquitte this book just rehashes the adaptation philosophy. Probably great for some but the majority will just be wasting their time with this title."
"Positive","Slowcore with Balls: Believe it or not, I'm not familiar with Snow Patrol, Arab Strap, or even Belle and Sebastian. I bought this album because I heard it playing in the record store. It's wonderful: poignant, playful, subtly profound. It starts very simply -- a voice and and acoustic guitar -- and builds slowly and steadily to a raging rocker, but gently all the way, and with a sweet ""goodbye"" at the close.Fans of Yo La Tengo, Low, and the (incredible and underrated) Red House Painters should love this."
"Negative","dreary puzzle: This is really such a dreary film, with all these wonderful people. How could it have turned out so dull? I suppose Porter must have been sick at the time. But there is nothing really alive here: the songs are below second rate, the dances are nothing, and the story -- which should be sparkling -- isn't. The bulk of the blame probably goes to the script, but it is interesting how unloveable Gene Kelly is here: the part is completely wrong for him. Hard to say why. Perhaps the truth is that everyone in the film is too old for their parts (except Elg) and too intelligent to be dragged down by what is essentialy one of those late 30s films about backstage life. None of them are believable as innocent naives. Curiously enough, Fred Astaire might have made the thing work: but that is because he was always better at being the naive surprised at his own emotions."
"Negative","NIPPLES SHOW: When I hear ""full coverage"" I think of bras that won't reveal nipples. This is not the case with this bra. I do NOT want anyone to see my nipples showing through a blouse. Ever. I returned it immediately. I'll go with something else. If you don't care about having a bra give you full NIPPLE coverage, then by all means ... consider this one."
"Negative","Complete junk: These will fall out. Most pegs will either have a small bit of plastic coming up behind the shelf such that they cannot come out once you put the shelf in. Not these. Unless you do a pressure-fit into the hole (make the hole smaller than the peg), these supports will fall out. Not worth returning, but going straight in the trash. A waste of $$$."
"Negative","Poor service: First off, we never received the magazine until 5 months after ordered!!! We have only received one or two issues. Extremely Poor Service, and why get the magazine with out the disc??? I wanted to get my husband a present for Christmas, not expecting something so poor to be offered through Amazon!!!!Very displeased in PA!!"
"Positive","LaVinia: I got the CD early and I was surprised because it plays like new. This is the first time that I ordered used CD and I'm happy because my collection of NOW CD's will almost complete. Keep up the excellent job and honesty!"
"Negative","Not for everyone: The item arrived in two days and packaging was fine.I do not recommend this item if your aid is RIC behind the ear.The physical size of the container requires that you must drop the aid in and shake it out.I replaced this item with Super Dri Aid which has a larger opening for every day use the Dri Eze fostore my backup aid."
"Positive","Go see the show!: Just go see the show...it's really great, and you'll want the soundtrack after you see it."
"Positive","A Great Gift for Someone Who Loves Architecture: I gave this book as a gift to someone who loves and understands architecture. He found it most interesting. It contains many facts that are not generally know about large, historical structures."
"Positive","Put this album on repeat: The first time I heard several of the songs from this album on Pandora radio and I was immediately hooked. I told a friend how much I loved the songs so he bought the album for me. Since I've had it, I can't stop listening to it. Simply gorgeous!!"
"Negative","I have to agree...: I have been the most ardent of fans and unlike most Shadow Rising adherents I feel that the Lord of Chaos is the pinnacle of the series. This book however, like the last two, is an extremely boring disappointment. There is no direction and it is obvious Jordan has lost control of the story. So many characters have simply disappeared that I have lost count; not to mention the fact that the prologue seems to be a prologue for book eleven more than book ten. The one redeeming part of the book was Mats story which of course was without any kind of character or plot arc, but at least he is entertaining. There are so many questions about who is where and what I am actually angry at this book. I am of course going to keep buying the books though. ..."
"Negative","Golden Girls Complete Series: This has been a horrible experience. The seller was very rude to me ""I DON'T NEED YOUR PUNK $113"" and did nothing to track the purchase. I haven't heard any intervention from Amazon to show that my business is important. Needless to say, the order never showed up. Be very wary with outside sellers is all I can say. And dispute no-shows with your credit card company."
"Negative","Poor Quality, Terrible Service: Lost my returns: I ordered this product in December of 2012, right after buying my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and it looked like a nice basic case. I found that it does provide good protection for the phone; but the quality of the case isn't so good.After just a week or so, the rubberized plastic started chipping off around the corners near the screen. I contacted them and they offered to replace it, so I placed another order and sent the original back.The new one I received seemed alright; but only a couple of days after ordering the clip came off and would not stay on very well. I don't know anyone in their right mind who would want to clip an expensive phone onto them, with a clip that slips off easily. That's a good way to lose your phone.I just mailed the second case back at my own expense. I don't know why I should have to pay shipping; but I guess that's the policy. Hopefully I get credit for both purchases soon."
"Negative","Get Real: Mariah Carey has long been looked at as one of my idols. I thought how she was doing something that she loved and didn't worry about having to ""lip sync"", due to the fact she has a marvelous voice. I was wrong. Mariah Carey was obviously ""lip syncing"" in this video. All of the songs sound just as they did when they were released. I begining to think she has lost her confidence."
"Negative","This is by far the worst book on holograms in print: I believe this book does a great disservice to our industry bringing the worst ""Internet ethics"" into the realm of technical literature. It exploits the fact that there is a real need for a new book on this subject and cynically fails to deliver the goods, whilst disingenuously dressing up the package to make a quick sale. most of the text has simply been lifted from other sources (mostly the internet where one can read it for free) and is now several years out of date. The new reader would have no reason to suspect this, however, as in the author's ""end notes"" he cites his sources as being from the last couple of years. That might not matter, except that the world has moved on and it is now a little sad, to read chapters about building a studio for silver halide holography, as though we were in 1981 rather than 2001. It's like reading a typewriter manual, or a guidebook for Windows 3.1. - it's just not relevant anymore."
"Positive","Stir it up Sean: I can't believe Amazon will let people who obviously haven't read the book write reviews. Just goes to show you how frustrated the liberals are. But all is fair in love and war. So, just to provide some balance to the gutless 1 star reviewers who are obviously attacking Sean Hannity, I'm going to give his new book 5 big ones. Please people, keep these reviews honest."
"Positive","For Charlie Christian and Benny Goodman: This recording was released domestically in 1986 as ""For Charlie Christian and Benny Goodman"" with 3 additional tracks that were not on the original recording. It's still obtainable and substantially cheaper than the imported ""A Generation Ago Today""."
"Negative","Deserves no stars: I really wanted to give this movie a chance too. I can't believe I did. It is by far the worst Crow ever and quite simply, almost the worst movie I've seen. I powered through it hoping the end would vindicate it. No such luck. Furlong has no credibility as the Crow. He looks like a girl with the makeup and choker and he had zero confidence. Tara Reid is ridiculous as is most of the cast except for the girlfriend of the Crow. Add to it that I think none of the Native Americans were actually Native Americans. The plot sucked, the acting sucked and the story is a waste of time. Don't bother.To all those who have given this movie three stars and more, I'm pretty sure someone paid you to write an ok review. That's the only way this movie rates more than one star."
"Positive","breakaway: Garfunkel in great performance, sings beautiful songs. Lyrics by Tom Jobim, S. Wonder, Gallagher and Lyle, Paul Simon ..."
"Negative","FM transmitter is the worthless: I purchased a starmate 4 and got the car kit for it. It was purchased as a second radio, I have a older sportster that works excellent. Then purchased a new car and decided to use the starmate 4 for the new carthe sound quality was unbearable from the FM transmitter. Every radio station was bleeding in on it worst part is I was on a 6 hour trip. FM transmitter is worthless, I'm looking for a new FM transmitter adaptable to the starmate 4 or if I don't I'm trashing the piece of junk."
"Negative","Smelled like windex: My husband bought these thinking they looked good,We got them home, made them and the smell was awful. well we decided to taste them anyway BIG MISTAKE! They tasted worse then they smelled! Upon further consideration, we decided to not feed it to the dogs. We wouldn't want them to get sick... we love our dogs."
"Negative","Worst camera ever!: I got this as a gift a couple years ago and it's the biggest waste ever. I thought I've been working it wrong and have messed with the settings until I'm blue in the face trying to get the quality of the image anywhere decent. I can be out in the sunlight and the image is still so dark you can barely see anything. Plus, don't leave your batteries in it or it'll run them down. This things eats batteries like crazy. I'm really going to hate explaining to my parents that we had to get a new camera because the one they bought us was a piece of crap."
"Positive","Awesome!!!: This is a great tale I loved every second of it! It is by far one of the best stories I have had the pleasure of reading!"
"Positive","Now this is what I would call a ""feel-good"" movie.: Watching the video always makes me feel good at the end. It is my favorite movie of all time."
"Negative","Poor production quality: While the exercises on this video were simple enough for my obese friend. The production was so ridiculous it seemed like a joke. I personally use high quality exercise videos such as Jillian Michael's and Jackie Warner. I've even used the Biggest Loser workouts which I think are really great, but still just a little too advanced for my friend. This video had some good reviews and I was really hoping it would be a truly good beginners forum. If anyone has any suggestions for a basic beginners instructional video, but with the production quality of the big name videos, I would be very grateful."
"Negative","tea pot: I saw this tea pot on amazon thought the price was decent so I ordered, and when I received it, it wasn't at all what I thought it was it looked much bigger on the computer but it was toy size. I ended up sending it back. I needed a kettle for my wood fireplace to put humidity in the air. If you need a little cast iron tea pot to make tea it would probably work for you."
"Negative","TORTUROUS!: It's not very often that I dislike a comedy(?) as much as this. It is even rarer that I write reviews as this is the first, but I just had to warn anyone who is over 15 and has 2 brain cells left, STAY AWAY. I knew after the first 10 minutes I would not like this movie but I stayed with it just to see how bad it would get. I wasn't disappointed as it got much worse. Nothing funny about this movie. This makes Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison look like classics. As I watched I wondered what Adam Sandler had on Kathy Bates(a past Oscar winner if I'm not mistaken) to get her to do this piece of garbage. It's sad to think this drivel made about 200 million at the box office and 4 stars from reviewers as I write this. Zero stars would have been my choice."
"Negative","Shipping outrageous: Want to get two of these belts and they come from the same supplier but they want to charge $8 EACH to ship. Cmon guys!"
"Negative","a flash of insight doth not a book make: This book is based on the observation that, for better or worse, we make decisions in the blink of an eye and that the ability to ""thin slice"" information is often crucial for timely action. This is all well and good, but I was hoping for information on how to cultivate this skill, avoid misusing it, etc. All the book gives is example after example, after example. Might be worth reading if you've never thought about it before."
"Positive","Helpful for elbow pain!: I actually wore out my old Aircast brace and was having trouble with both arms, so I bought two of them. After all, if both arms hurt, I need one for each! My elbow pain is usually caused by too much computer use, so when I have trouble, I wear the braces at night while I sleep. If I am really having trouble, then I wear the brace(s) during the day too. Originally, my doctor recommended that I buy the Aircast, and I have found that after a few weeks, the pain usually leaves.The air pillow puts gentle pressure in just the right place, supports the tendons, and helps reduce the inflammation. The Aircast also keeps me from folding my arms too tightly when I sleep. I highly recommend this brace and like it much better than the type that doesn't have the air pillow."
"Positive","Great all-around: The album is great. Some much more refined songs from the Renacimiento album and fun spanish lyrics for ""Spill the Wine"". They keep getting better..."
"Positive","An excelent study on a fascinating city.: Though at first the size of the book seems to be huge, Large infused every page of this wonderful novel with sensory rich descriptions that helped the reader feel what life in Berlin was like during the city's many different stages. Clearly an expert in this field, Large provides amusing and interesting details about famous landmarks, areas, and figures throughout the cities turbulant history. Having read the book only weeks before my planned trip to the German capital, I now look at the book as an indepth tour guide of the city. I got goosebumps sometimes even seeing a street sign named after an important figure in the city's history who after reading the book, I was able to recall the impact this person had on creating the atmosphere of the vibrant city of modern Berlin, now one of my very favorite in all the world."
"Negative","Repetitious Repetitious: The story was good, especially some of the parts about sex (with of-age consenting partners); but the facts were told over and over again. The story was good, especially some of the parts about sex (with of-age consenting partners); but the facts were told over and over again.If writing like this doesn't bother you, read this book."
"Negative","Why the price variance?: So... why the massive price difference between a mailed code (at extra cost) and an emailed code? The emailed code is $60 vs $43 to have the card mailed out. Crazy!"
"Positive","Surprisingly good!: I'm not a big fan of fantasy/supernatural/scifi books so I thought twice about downloading this book about mermaids, but the high reader reviews persuaded me. I am so glad I did! Alice at Heart is a good read - enjoyable, thought-provoking, and kept my sometimes easy to wander attention. I liked it so much that I actually searched for other books by this author, expecting anything else she had written to be very much in the same genre. I was quite surprised to find that I've actually read two other books by Deborah Smith (Crossroads Cafe & Mossy Creek) that had nothing to do with mermaids or fantasy creatures and really enjoyed them. She is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors! I have found all of her books to be very enjoyable, have an interesting storyline, and to have very well-written, real-seeming characters. I saw that another reviewer said that her writing was too detailed and slow, but that wasn't my experience at all."
"Negative","Do Not Buy. Faulty Product, Stops working on slightest bump!: I purchased this drive after reading good reviews on it, and used it to store most of my media files which my harddrive could no longer hold. Worst Idea Ever. After simply being knocked over onto its side on my desk, the product has stopped being recognized by my computer and it appears I have lost all my media files. Definitely not worth it, and I would recommend not storing your files on it. It is not a safe hard drive."
"Negative","Boring and rarely funny: Gotta tell ya, this SHOULD have been a great movie, all of the ingredients were top shelf, it just didn't jell. Thankfully someone lent me their copy (to save me the $22) and told me that they hated it, boy were they right. It wasn't funny very often, it was slow, it was boring, and worst of all at the end I was sitting wondering what the hell the point of the whole thing was, dumb!Rent this one if you must subject yourself to it, it is NOT worth owning unless you or your uncle were in it and just want to show friends that you were in a movie with Clooney."
"Negative","Boring with a capital B: I usually do not review books but felt it was necessary with this one. After reading the reviews (5 stars), I thought the book would be a page turner. I kept wondering when the action was going to start......."
"Positive","Joan Armatrading: Really wanted this cd which was out of print. Now I have a collectors item. I love it."
"Positive","Best book of the series.: The beginning of the story is heartwarming with the relationship between Gom and Harga. There is gut wrenching emotion when they are forced to part again. Gom grows up so much during his search for a mentor. There is great imagination about the seven realms and everyones position is defined clearly. Highly recommended."
"Negative","Good license, poor game: It seems that the game was poorly designed and put together in a hurry to coincide with the video release. The gameplay is boring and monotonous. The controls are sloppy and difficult. The cut-scenes are minimal at best. The graphics are substandard. Also, the package indicates that you can save the game with the use of a memory card but on inspection, there is no save feature."
"Positive","Cute outfit, but...: I purchase the Teen Trends outfits for my Mini Super Dollfie (Luts Delf Kid), and they fit great, minus the shoes. I actually ended up returning this outfit, since the skirt is a bit too ""adult"" for my girl, and the top fits very oddly. I believe it would fit oddly on the Teen Trends dolls as well. It sort of makes the dolls look pregnant. I know this is a style, but I don't want my ten-year-old-looking doll to appear pregnant, thanks. Very durable outfit, cute if that's your style, but it's too flashy, even for an expensive doll."
"Positive","hard-core funk for you: i don't understand why this cd have been rate this low.this the bomb on the westbound session. full of guitar funk ; lovers of hendrix might fall in love with this cd. you'll prefer some song but you won't hate one. to me this is pure funk...cd to own if you wanna know what is funkadelic and if your a fan you must own it right now...dont pay to much attention to previous review they are not funky as me..."
"Negative","Worst Lunch Box Ever: The lunch box has a flap that unzips (when the zipper doesn't get stuck). The flap is located where the rear of the van would be, therefore, it is very, very small and very, very inaccessible for loading the lunchbox. The zipper is so bad that the school ""suggested"" that we get another lunchbox because there were times that even the lunch monitors couldn't get it open. As other reviewers mentioned, I only got a lunch box and it was a huge waste of money. My child grabbed it and used it before I could return it. Probably my worst Amazon purchase ever."
"Negative","Died in 8 months Smartdisk difficult to deal with: The drive was great but only lasted for 8 months when it crashed, and I lost all of my data. SmartDisk was not helpful at all and actually rude when trying to resolve this issue - I finally gave up and will never buy a SmartDisk product again! CAUTION ADVISED!!!JoAnn"
"Positive","DECIDE TU DESPUES DE LEER ESTE LIBRO,: AMIGA:¿que es el hombre ? ( culpable de adulterio la mayoría de las veces ). POLIGAMO O SIMPLEMENTE TRAIDOR ?ESTE LIBRO TIENE UNA POSICION BASTANTE DEFINIDA Y ARGUMENTOS INTELIGENTES Y DE MUCHO PESO...Vale la pena!"
"Negative","Not what was shown in photo: I ordered this for my kittens, they love it anyway but the one in the photo has fleece and the one I received didn't have it. Since I needed it right away to keep my foster kittens happy I kept it but I know the fleece one is nicer and better for them. One other note, I know it shows for Ferrets but I use it for kittens and within two weeks they had this broken. I have seen Ferrets at play and so wonder if they are just as hard on these as my kittens. They really need to re-enforce the straps for anything that might chew on it. Still if you want a temporary toy and fun thing for your pets this might do but just remember it is only good for a short period of time."
"Positive","This album is great, but....: I love Nsync's new album! This even has two new songs on it. This CD is good if you want the bonus tracks on the same CD as the other songs. However, you can find ""Falling"" and ""That Girl"" on the recently released soundtrack ""On the Line"", the movie that Lance and Joey are in. That is why these two songs didn't make it on the US album. In addition, the OTL soundtrack has Briney, BBMak, a solo by Joey, and other good songs. I highly recommend it. But if you don't want to pay more money for a whole new CD and just want Nsync songs, this would be a good buy. The bonus tracks are worth the extra money, and makes the CD a little longer."
"Negative","This one sucked too: I do not know what this one was about. I think it was just basically saying how a young man can care for a farm and make a profit off it and how it is inherited to him."
"Negative","Defective screens: Great concept: horrible execution!!I have had two Kindles. Despite treating each with kid gloves (always in the case, never dropped, nothing spilled on them) both had defective screens, rendering them useless. There is no point in this device if you cannot rely on it. I had taken it on a trip to the Mideast and had not packed physical books. I was left high and dry. Quality is extremely poor."
"Negative","Lots of stains on my carpeting: This carpet cleaner has worked well the first couple times but since then does next to nothing except get the floor wet. Even when attempting to clean a fresh stain, I can't get the stain out with this. I have had better luck with my little handheld dirt devil. Its not easy to clean this thing out either so its probably just clogged. Additionally, I have to heat the water up before putting in there because it comes out cold. Even with hot water added, its still NOT steam as the name would imply. Unfortunately this is the only one I have ever owned (aside from the handheld) so can't recommend a better one. This one does seem to do well with just picking up a bit of dirt and probably a few allergens that are lying in the carpet."
"Negative","Needle detached: The needle pointer can become detached does not give and accurate reading.If you are patient and jiggle it just right you may be able to get if back in position on it's post."
"Positive","Trail of Tears: I loved this DVD. It was interesting and very informative. I am part Cherokee indian, so it was especially close to my heart. I would recomend this DVD to anyone interested in a great documentary about our native americans."
"Negative","Courageous: The idea of this movie is great and message is well taken... But did not like that women played little role in christian life as stated, and too much preaching (even though I am a christian, I feel the preaching was too much and unreal)."
"Negative","Fodder for remainder table: Responding to several reviews that hailed this work as the sound of a refreshing new voice, I approached it with eager anticipation. Alas, despite repeated attempts to get into the book, I could not get very far. That new voice is sophomoric, and although the vacuousness is doubtless an artifice to expose the mind of the narrator, I decided after the third try that life is too short to spend any of it getting to know Ronnie and his friends. Too bad to sacrifice trees for this."
"Negative","Overdone, unnecessarily exxagerated, specious information: ""What is the point""? is the phrase that came to mind when I read this book. It is not about Orchids and should have been titled the ""Potential Real Estate Investor's guide to Florida's history, flora, fauna, geography, people and any obscure information that you'd like to know but cannot find anyhwhere else.""This book talks about boring and extremely obscure poeple and things that one doesn't care about. It never stays on point, namely this interesting LaRoche character. Instead going on about the history of different countries and poeples, palm trees, elephants, zebras, icebergs, you name it , it's in there.I lvoe books, read a lot, and don't see what these other reviewers liked about it."
"Positive","Small drive, it rocks!: I bought one of these little drives for school, and it's awesome. It's so much easier to keep all my info for ALL my classes on one drive so I don't have to mess around with disks anymore. Did I metion how small these things are?"
"Negative","Spatter Cover: Spatter cover was supposed to fit the Nordic Ware bacon cooker. Unfortunately it doesn't have a tight fit and slides right off from the bacon cooker."
"Positive","good stuff: i saw this moons ago under the title ""creepers"". Anchor bay has done it again. The print looks great and sounds good. Speaking of sound, has anyone ever seen a film with a moodier score? that music in the beginning when the girl is walking to her doom is excellent. The film takes place almost entirely in the dark. its got a rather nasty killer. its got jennifer connely. go buy it."
